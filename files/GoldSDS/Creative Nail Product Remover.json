                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

A substantial amount of acetone can also be found in water, which is consistent with the high water to air partition coefficient and its small, but detectable, presence in rain water, sea water, and lake water samples. Very little acetone is expected to reside in soil, biota, or suspended solids. This is entirely consistent with the physical and chemical properties of acetone and with measurements showing a low propensity for soil absorption and a high preference for moving through the soil and into the ground water</p> <p>In air, acetone is lost by photolysis and reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; the estimated half-life of these combined processes is about 22 days. The relatively long half-life allows acetone to be transported long distances from its emission source.</p> <p>Acetone is highly soluble and slightly persistent in water, with a half-life of about 20 hours; it is minimally toxic to aquatic life.</p> <p>Acetone released to soil volatilises although some may leach into the ground where it rapidly biodegrades.</p> <p>Acetone does not concentrate in the food chain.</p> <p>Acetone meets the OECD definition of readily biodegradable which requires that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) is at least 70% of the theoretical oxygen demand (THOD) within the 28-day test period</p> <p>Drinking Water Standard: none available.</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: none available.</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: none available.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Testing shows that acetone exhibits a low order of toxicity</p> <p>Fish LC50: brook trout 6070 mg/l; fathead minnow 15000 mg/l</p> <p>Bird LC0 (5 day): Japanese quail, ring-neck pheasant 40,000 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): 15800 mg/l; NOEC 8500 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate 2100 - 16700 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic plant NOEC: 5400-7500 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna chronic NOEC 1660 mg/l</p> <p>Acetone vapors were shown to be relatively toxic to two types insects and their eggs. The time to 50% lethality (LT50) was found to be 51.2 hr and 67.9 hr when the flour beetle (<i>Tribolium confusum</i>) and the flour moth (<i>Ephestia kuehniella</i>) were exposed to an airborne acetone concentration of 61.5 mg/m3. The LT50 values for the eggs were 30-50% lower than for the adult. The direct application of acetone liquid to the body of the insects or surface of the eggs did not, however, cause any mortality.</p> <p>The ability of acetone to inhibit cell multiplication has been examined in a wide variety of microorganisms. The results have generally indicated mild to minimal toxicity with NOECs greater than 1700 mg/L for exposures lasting from 6 hr to 4 days. Longer exposure periods of 7 to 8 days with bacteria produced mixed results; but overall the data indicate a low degree of toxicity for acetone. The only exception to these findings were the results obtained with the flagellated protozoa (<i>Entosiphon sulcatum</i>) which yielded a 3-day NOEC of 28 mg/L.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Systemic effects of acetone inhalation exposure include central nervous system depression, light-headedness, incoherent speech, ataxia, stupor, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia and ketosis. Rarely, convulsions and tubular necrosis may be evident. Other symptoms of exposure may include restlessness, headache, vomiting, low blood-pressure and rapid and irregular pulse, eye and throat irritation, weakness of the legs and dizziness. Inhalation of high concentrations may produce dryness of the mouth and throat, nausea, uncoordinated movement, loss of coordinated speech, drowsiness and, in severe cases, coma.

                "Use": "<p>In perfumery/ flavouring.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Terpenes are a large and varied class of hydrocarbons produced primarily by a wide variety of plants, particularly conifers, though also by some insects such as swallowtail butterflies, which emit terpenes They are the major components of resins, and of turpentine produced from resin. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as terpinoids. Some authors will use the term terpene to include all terpenoids. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential of many types of plants and flowers. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives Vitamin A is an example of a terpene.</p> <p>Terpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of isoprene which has the molecular formula C5H8. The basic molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of that, (C5H8)n where n is the number of linked isoprene units. This is called the isoprene rule or the C5 rule. The isoprene units may be linked together \"head to tail\" to form linear chains or they may be arranged to form rings. One can consider the isoprene unit as one of nature's common building blocks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As chains of isoprene units are built up, the resulting terpenes are classified sequentially by size as hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, sesterterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hemiterpenes consist of a single isoprene unit. Isoprene itself is considered the only hemiterpene, but oxygen-containing derivatives such as prenol and isovaleric acid are hemiterpenoids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Monoterpenes consist of two isoprene units and have the molecular formula C10H16. Examples of monoterpenes are: geraniol, limonene, terpineol.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sesquiterpenes consist of three isoprene units and have the molecular formula C15H24. Examples of sesquiterpenes are:farnesol . The sesqui- prefix means one and a half.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Diterpenes are composed for four isoprene units and have the molecular formula C20H32. They derive from geranyl pyrophosphate. Examples of diterpenes are cafestol, kahweol, cembren and taxadiene (precursor of Taxol). Diterpenes also form the basis for biologically important compounds such as retinol, retinal and phytol.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sesterterpenes, terpenes having 25 carbons and five isoprene units, are rare relative to the other sizes. The sester- prefix means half to three, i.e. two and a half.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Triterpenes consist of six isoprene units and have the molecular formula C30H48. The linear triterpene squalene the major constituent of shark liver oil, is derived from the reductive coupling of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Squalene is then processed biosynthetically to generate either lanosterol or cycloartenol the structural precursors to all the steroids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Tetraterpenes contain eight isoprene units and have the molecular formula C40H56. Biologically important tetraterpenes include the acyclic lycopene, the monocyclic gamma-carotene, and the bicyclic alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Polyterpenes consist of long chains of many isoprene units.Rubber consists of polyisoprene in which double bonds are cis-. Some plants produce a polyisoprene with trans double bonds, known as gutta-percha</p>|Flavouring, fragrance and perfume materials. Used as solvent in cleaners and degreasers; solvent for resins, polymers, waxes; wetting agent. Manufacture of specialist resins. Sulfurised derivatives in lube oils.|[~Fragrance ~]",

Calculated lifetimes for the reaction of d-limonene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals range from 0.3-2 h based on experimentally determined rate constants. \u00a0The oxidation of limonene may contribute to aerosol and photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>Calculated lifetimes for the night-time reaction of d-limonene with nitrate radicals range form 0.9 to 9 minutes. \u00a0The daytime atmospheric lifetime of d-limonene is estimated to range from 12 to 48 min. depending upon local hydroxyl rate and ozone concentrations. Products produced from hydroxy radical reaction with limonene are 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene, a keto-aldehyde, formaldehyde, 3-oxobutanal, glyoxal and a C10 dicarbonyl. The same carbonyls, along with formic acid and C8 and C9 carboxylic acids, \u00a0may form in reactions with ozone. Ozonolysis of limonene may also lead to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides, which have various toxic effects on plant cells and may damage forests.</p> <p>Products of ozonolysis include bis(hydroxmethyl)peroxide, a precursor to hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of d-limonene with ozone in the dark results in the formation of 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene and formaldehyde. Reactions with nitrogen oxides produce aerosol formation as well as lower molecular weight products such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone and peroxyacetyl nitrate.</p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>\u00a0When released to the ground limonene is expected to have low to very low mobility in soil based on its physicochemical properties. The soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) calculated on the basis of solubility (13.8 mg/l, 25 C) and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (4.23) ranges from 1030 and 4780. The Henry's law constant indicates that limonene will rapidly volatilise from both dry and moist soil; however its absorption to soil may slow the process.</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate</b>: In the aquatic environment, limonene is expected to evaporate to a significant extent owing \u00a0to its high volatility. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of limonene from a model river ( 1 m deep, flow 1 m/s and wind speed 3 m/s) is 3.4 h. Some limonene is expected to absorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation and bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Limonene does not have functional groups for hydrolysis and its cyclohexene ring and ethylene group are known to resist hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of limonene is not expected in terrestrial or in aquatic environments. The hydrolytic half-life of d-limonene is estimated to be &gt;1000 days. Biotic degradation of limonene has been shown with some species of microorganisms such as\u00a0<i>Penicillium digitatum, Corynespora cassiicola, Diplodia gossyppina</i>\u00a0and a soil strain of<i>\u00a0Pseudomonans sp (SL strain).\u00a0</i>Limonene is readily biodegradable (41-98% degradation by biological oxygen demand in 14 d) under aerobic conditions in a standard test (OECD 301 C \"Modified MITI Test (1)\", OECD, 1981a; MITI, 1992). Also in a test simulating aerobic sewage treatment (OECD 303 A \"Simulation Test - Aerobic Sewage Treatment: Coupled Units Test\"; OECD, 1981b), limonene disappeared almost completely (&gt;93.8%) during 14 days of incubation.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation has been assessed under anaerobic conditions; there was no indication of any metabolisms, possibly because of the toxicity to micro-organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>The bioconcentration factor, calculated on the basis of water solubility and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Kow) is 246-262, suggesting that limonene may bioaccumulate in fish and other aquatic species.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b>\u00a0Technical limonene is practically nontoxic to birds on a subacute dietary basis, and is slightly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates on an acute basis.\u00a0</p> <p>for d-limonene:</p> <p>LD50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 16 weeks old) oral &gt;2000 mg/kg</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 10 day old) dietary &gt;5620 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Anas platyrhynchos (Mallard duck, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 80 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 71.4-88.7 ppm); static /92% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 568 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 437-852 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>EC50 Daphnia magna (Water flea, &lt;24 hr old; intoxication, immobilization) 17 ppm/48 hr (95% confidence limit: 11-33 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 966 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 740-1652 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 38.5 mg/L/96 hr; flow through /from table/ LC50</p> <p>Leuciscus idus (Golden orfe) 32 mg/L/48 hr /Conditions of bioassay not specified in source examined</p> <p>The acute toxicity of \u00a0d-limonene ranges from slight to high for aquatic organisms.

In its pure form it is not a sensitiser but is irritating to the skin. Although there is clear evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats, the effect has been attributed to an alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G) renal toxicity which is both species and gender specific. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G, and metabolism studies indicate that 75% to 95% of d-limonene is excreted in 2-3 days with different metabolites identified between humans and rats.

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

High purity d-limonene does not cause significant allergic reaction in guinea pigs; d-limonene, exposed to air for 2-months, sensitised the animals and it is surmised that allergenic compounds are formed after prolonged air contact. In human patch testing, weak or moderate reactions (erythema, swelling) have been observed. Positive eczematous responses to purified limonene were observed in 5 of 16 previously sensitised to oil of turpentine. In one study, a 39-year old male immersed one hand in a jar of solvent, ensuring that inhalation exposure was minimal. After only few minutes of exposure, the subject experienced painful itching and burning. Itching decreased after the exposure but burning continued for 10 minutes. Swelling disappeared after 100 minutes. Six hours post-exposure, a purpuric eruption was observed; this persisted for several weeks. Blood concentrations during skin exposure were low compared to those during inhalation exposure.</p>",

They may result when d-limonene is unstabilised against oxidation, or upon prolonged standing at room temperature and/ or upon exposure to light, or when stabiliser levels diminish. The two major hydroperoxides in auto-oxidised d-limonene, \u00a0are cis- and trans- limonene-2-hydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-p-mentha-6,8-diene). In photo-oxidised d-limonene, they represent a minor fraction. Hydroperoxides may bind to proteins of the skin to make antigens either via a radical mechanism or after reactions to give epoxides. The cross-reactivity between the epoxide limonene-1,2-oxide, a potent contact allergen, and the hydroperoxides is NOT significant, indicating different mechanisms of sensitisation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0d-Limonene was considered to be weakly carcinogenic for the mouse fore-stomach epithelium, but not tumour producing. In 13-week and 2-year gavage-studies, male rats showed a range of compound-related kidney lesions including exacerbation of age-related nephropathy, mineralisation in the renal medulla, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium overlying the renal papilla and proliferation of the renal tubular epithelium. Neoplasms were believed to be caused by progression to tubular cell hyperplasia to tubular cell adenomas and, with increasing size, to adenocarcinomas or carcinomas. The similarity of the nephrotoxicity caused by trichloroethylene and N-(4'-fluoro-4-biphenyl)acetamide, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate in rats and the species specific nature of the response suggests that degeneration and necrosis of convoluted tubules may be associated with the accumulation of alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G). Since a2u-G is a species and gender-specific protein that is causal for both the cytotoxic and carcinogenic response in male rats, extrapolation of d-limonene carcinogenicity data from rat studies to other species (including humans) is probably not warranted. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G; they do however produce other related low molecular weight proteins capable of binding chemicals that cause a2u-G nephropathy in rats but this does not necessarily connote human risk. The Risk Assessment Forum of the USA EPA concluded;</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0Male renal rat tumours arising as a result of a process involving a2u-G accumulation do not contribute to the qualitative weight-of-evidence that the chemical poses a human carcinogenic hazard. Such tumours are included in dose-response extrapolations for the estimation of human carcinogenic risk.\u00a0</li> <li>If the chemical induces a2u-G accumulation in male rats, the associated nephropathy is not to be used as an end-point for determining non-carcinogenic hazard.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>In the presence of air, a number of common flavour and fragrance chemicals can form peroxides surprisingly fast. Antioxidants can in most cases minimise the oxidation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fragrance terpenes are generally easily oxidised in air. \u00a0Non-oxidised limonene, linalool and caryophyllene turned out to be very weak sensitizers, however after oxidation limonene hydroperoxide and linalool hydroperoxide are strong sensitizers. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time. Autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes greatly to fragrance allergy, which emphasizes the need of testing with compounds that patients are actually exposed to and not only with the ingredients originally applied in commercial formulations.</p> <p>Peroxidisable terpenes and terpenoids should only be used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level, for instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production. Such products should have a peroxide value of less than 10 millimoles peroxide per liter. This requirement is based on the published literature mentioning sensitising properties when containing peroxides.</p>",
