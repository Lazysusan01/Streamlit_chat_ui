In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur. Manganese compound found in these soils\r\nappeared to catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 075-&gt;0.4 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Inhalation of (H2S) at low concentrations causes headache, dizziness and upset stomach. Higher concentrations cause olfactory fatigue, irritation to the respiratory tract, excitement, confusion, and exposure for a prolonged period may cause bronchitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Although hydrogen sulfide is extremely odourous, the \"rotten egg\" odour is not a reliable indicator for warning of exposure since odour fatigue readily occurs.

The lifetime of hydrogen sulfide in oxygenated blood is short and sulfmethaemoglobin is rapidly detoxified by red blood cells and the liver.

                "Appearance": "<p>Residual oils are manufactured in whole or in part from distillation residues from refinery processing. Residual oils are complex mixtures of relatively high molecular weight compounds and are difficult to characterise in detail. Molecular types include asphaltenes, polar aromatics, naphthalene aromatics, aromatics, saturated hydrocarbons and heteromolecules containing sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and metals.</p> <p>Most blending stocks of residual fuel oils are likely to contain 5% or more of four- to six-ring condensed aromatic hydrocarbons. In residual fuel oils, the identities and concentration of PAHs depends on the nature and amount of the low viscosity blending stocks and the proportions of virgin and cracked residues used in their production. If the blending stocks are primarily atmospheric or vacuum residues, the concentration of three- to seven-ring aromatic hydrocarbons are likely to be in the order of 6-8%; if larger quantities of heavily catalytically cracked or steam cracked components are used, the levels may approach 20%. One of the blending stocks, catalytically cracked clarified oil has been reported to contain 58% three-to five-ring aromatic hydrocarbons and 22% carbazoles and benzocarbazoles.</p>|Dark brown liquid; floats on water.|The recovered oil obtained by skimming all plant oil-bearing water streams.

Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience suggests, that the material may cause eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or is expected to produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals.

Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis.

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material produces severe skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either:</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces severe inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant and severe inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> <li>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On the basis of limited epidemiological data, the material is regarded as carcinogenic to humans. At least one classification body considers that there is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High boiling residues of petroleum process streams produced a significant number of benign and malignant skin tumours after application to the skin of mice. Appreciable concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may be present in residual fuels because of the common practice of using both uncracked and cracked residues in their manufacture.</p> <p>Principal route of exposure is by skin contact; lesser exposures include inhalation of fumes from hot oils, oil mists or droplets. Prolonged contact with mineral oils carries with it the risk of skin conditions such as oil folliculitis, eczematous dermatitis, pigmentation of the face (melanosis) and warts on the sole of the foot (plantar warts). \u00a0With highly refined mineral oils no appreciable systemic effects appear to result through skin absorption.</p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to oil mists frequently elicits respiratory conditions, such as asthma; the provoking agent is probably an additive. High oil mist concentrations may produce lipoid pneumonia although clinical evidence is equivocal. In animals exposed to concentrations of 100 mg/m3 oil mist, for periods of 12 to 26 months, the activity of lung and serum alkaline phosphatase enzyme was raised; 5 mg/m3 oil mist did not produce this response. These enzyme changes are sensitive early indicators of lung damage. Workers exposed to vapours of mineral oil and kerosene for 5 to 35 years showed an increased prevalence of slight basal lung fibrosis.</p>",
