Viscosity @ 30 deg, C: 75% (7 cP); 81.5% (25 cP); 85% (32 cP). Dissociation constants @ 25 deg C: Step 1  7.52 x 10e-3 (2.12 pH); Step 2 6.23 x 10e-8 (7.21pH); Step 3 2.2 x 10e-13 (12.67pH) High concentrations may crystallize in cold weather. Acid at 100% is in the form of crystals.  Mixes with water and alcohol.|Pure anhydrous phosphoric acid (syn: orthophosphoric acid, phosphoric(V) acid) is a white solid that melts at 42.35 \u00b0C to form a colorless, viscous liquid.|Most people and even chemists refer to orthophosphoric acid as phosphoric acid, which is the IUPAC name for this compound. The prefix ortho is used to distinguish the acid from other phosphoric acids, called polyphosphoric acids. Orthophosphoric acid is a non-toxic, inorganic, rather weak triprotic acid, which, when pure, is a solid at room temperature and pressure.  Orthophosphoric acid is a very polar molecule; therefore it is highly soluble in water. The oxidation state of phosphorus (P) in ortho- and other phosphoric acids is +5; the oxidation state of all the oxygen atoms (O) is -2 and all the hydrogen atoms (H) is +1. Triprotic means that an orthophosphoric acid molecule can dissociate up to three times, giving up an H+ each time, which typically combines with a water molecule, H2O",

Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment. The growth of algae produces undesirable effects on the treatment of water for drinking purposes, on fisheries, and on the use of lakes for recreational purposes.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years.

Fluorides adsorbed on\r\nparticulate matter in the atmosphere are generally stable and are not readily\r\nhydrolysed, although they may be degraded by radiation if they persist in the\r\natmosphere. Fluorine and the silicon fluorides (fluosilicates, silicofluorides)\r\nare hydrolysed in the atmosphere to form hydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen fluoride\r\nmay combine with water vapour to produce an aerosol or fog of aqueous\r\nhydrofluoric acid.\u00a0 Based upon available data, inorganic fluoride compounds,\r\nwith the exception of sulfur hexafluoride, are not expected to remain in the\r\ntroposphere for long periods or to migrate to the stratosphere. Estimates of\r\nthe residence time of sulfur hexafluoride in the atmosphere range from 500 to\r\nseveral thousand years. Fluoride in aerosols can be transported over large\r\ndistances by wind or as a result of atmospheric turbulence. The distance\r\ntravelled is determined by the deposition velocity of both the gaseous hydrogen\r\nfluoride and the fluorides in particulate form. Atmospheric fluorides may be\r\ntransported to soils and surface waters through both wet and dry deposition\r\nprocesses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluorides undergo transformations in soil and water, forming\r\ncomplexes and binding strongly to soil and sediment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In water, the transport and transformation of inorganic fluorides\r\nare influenced by pH, water hardness and the presence of ion-exchange materials\r\nsuch as clays. In natural water, fluoride forms strong complexes with aluminum\r\nin water, and fluorine chemistry in water is largely regulated by aluminum\r\nconcentration and pH. Below pH 5, fluoride is almost entirely complexed with\r\naluminum and consequently, the concentration of free F- is low. As the pH\r\nincreases, Al-OH complexes dominate over Al-F complexes and the free F- levels\r\nincrease. Fluoride forms stable complexes with calcium and magnesium, which are\r\npresent in sea water. Calcium carbonate precipitation dominates the removal of\r\ndissolved fluoride from sea water. The residence time for fluoride in ocean\r\nsediment is calculated\u00a0 to be 2-3 million years. Fluorosilicic acid and\r\nhydrofluoric acid in high aquatic concentrations such as may be found in\r\nindustrial waste ponds may volatilise, releasing silicon tetrafluoride and\r\nhydrogen fluoride into the atmosphere. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Solubilisation of inorganic fluorides from minerals may also be\r\nenhanced by the presence of ion-exchange materials (e.g., bentonite clays and\r\nhumic acid). Once dissolved, inorganic fluorides remain in solution under\r\nconditions of low pH and hardness and in the presence of ion-exchange material.\r\nSoluble inorganic fluorides may also form aerosols at the air?water interface\r\nor vaporise into the atmosphere whereas undissolved species generally undergo\r\nsedimentation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Factors that influence the mobility of inorganic fluorides in soil\r\nare pH and the formation of aluminium and calcium complexes In more acidic\r\nsoils, concentrations of inorganic fluoride were considerably higher in the\r\ndeeper horizons. The low affinity of fluorides for organic material results in\r\nleaching from the more acidic surface horizon and increased retention by clay\r\nminerals and silts in the more alkaline, deeper horizons. The maximum\r\nadsorption of fluoride to soil was reported to occur at pH 5.5.\u00a0 In acidic\r\nsoils with pH below 6, most of the fluoride is in complexes with either\r\naluminium or iron. Fluoride in alkaline soils at pH 6.5 and above is almost\r\ncompletely fixed in soils as calcium fluoride, if sufficient calcium carbonate\r\nis available. Fluoride is extremely immobile in soil, as determined by lysimeter\r\nexperiments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Populations living in areas with high fluoride levels in\r\ngroundwater may be exposed to higher levels of fluorides in their drinking\r\nwater or in beverages prepared with the water. Among these populations, outdoor\r\nlaborers, people living in hot climates, and people with polydipsia will\r\ngenerally have the greatest daily intake of fluorides because they consume\r\ngreater amounts of water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Foods characteristically high in fluoride content are certain\r\ntypes of fish and seafood (1.9-28.5 mg/kg), especially those types in which the\r\nbones are consumed, bone products such as bone meal and gelatin, and tea, which\r\ncontains approximately 0.52 mg fluoride/cup\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluoride is mainly absorbed by the body in the form of hydrogen\r\nfluoride, which has a p<i>K</i>a of 3.45. That is, when ionic fluoride enters\r\nthe acidic environment of the stomach lumen, it is largely converted into\r\nhydrogen fluoride.

This includes any individuals with hydrogen fluoride exposure to the head, chest or neck areas. If there is no initial upper respiratory irritation, significant inhalation exposure can generally be ruled out.<br />Moderately concentrated solutions of hydrofluoric acid (&gt;40%) tend to fume and emanate hydrogen fluoride gas when exposed to air, producing yet another exposure risk through inhalation.<br />Even fairly low airborne concentrations of hydrogen fluoride produce rapid onset of eye, nose, and throat irritation. Hydrogen fluoride has a strong irritating odor that is discernible at concentrations of about 0.04 ppm. Higher concentrations of the vapour/ mist may cause corrosion of the throat, nose and lungs, leading to severe inflammation, pulmonary oedema or possible hypocalcaemia.<br />Vapour concentration of 10 ppm is regarded as intolerable but a vapour concentration of 30 ppm. is considered by NIOSH as: Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH).<br />In humans, inhalation of hydrogen fluoride gas may cause immediate or delayed-onset pulmonary oedema after a 1-hour exposure. In addition, exposure to high concentrations of the vapours of hydrofluoric acid characteristically results in ulcerative tracheobronchitis and haemorrhagic pulmonary edema; this local reaction is equivalent to that caused by gaseous hydrogen chloride. From accidental, occupational, and volunteer exposures, it is estimated that the lowest lethal concentration for a 5-minute human exposure to hydrogen fluoride is in the range of 50 to 250 ppm. Significant exposures by dermal or inhalation route may cause hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia; cardiac arrhythmias may follow. Acute renal failure has also been documented after an ultimately fatal inhalation exposure<br />Fluorides are not bound to any extent to plasma proteins. In human serum the fluoride occurs equally as nonionic and ionic forms. when fluoride intake is high the ionic form predominates.<br />Repeated sublethal exposures to hydrogen fluoride produce liver and kidney damage.<br />Rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs subject to hydrogen fluoride inhalation experienced significant irritation of the conjunctivae, nasal tissues, and respiratory system after acute inhalation exposures at near-lethal levels. Pathological lesions were observed in the kidney and liver, and the severity of the lesions was dose related. The external nares and nasal vestibules were black, and, at dosages causing considerable mortality, those areas showed zones of mucosal and submucosal necrosis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce severely toxic effects. Relatively small amounts absorbed from the lungs may prove fatal.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p>",

The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>Experiments in which a 20-percent aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid (hydrogen fluoride) was instilled into the eyes of rabbits caused immediate damage in the form of total corneal opacification and conjunctival ischemia; within an hour, corneal stroma edema occurred, followed by necrosis of anterior ocular structures.</p> <p>The vapour may produce pronounced discomfort of the eyes when present at higher concentrations and this generally gives warning of excessive exposure and the need for control measures to ensure safe working conditions</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Strong evidence exists that exposure to the material may produce very serious irreversible damage (other than carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and teratogenesis) following a single exposure by skin contact.</p> <p>The skin is readily penetrated by the fluoride ion causing liquefaction necrosis of the soft tissues and decalcification and corrosion of bone. Healing is delayed and necrotic changes may continue to occur and spread beneath a layer of tough coagulated skin.</p> <p>Percutaneous absorption of pure liquefied hydrogen fluoride gas produced severe hypocalcaemia, multiple attacks of ventricular fibrillation, and death 9.5 hours after exposure. Skin contact with hydrogen fluoride or solutions containing more than 30 percent hydrogen fluoride produces immediate pain; reactions to more dilute solutions may be delayed for many hours. The accompanying pain is excruciating and persistent due to delayed healing.\u00a0</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Contact of the skin with liquid hydrofluoric acid (hydrogen fluoride) may cause severe burns, erythema, and swelling, vesiculation, and serious crusting. With more serious burns, ulceration, blue-gray discoloration, and necrosis may occur. Solutions of hydrofluoric acid, as dilute as 2%, may cause severe skin burns. <br />Dermal burns may not be readily noticed or painful, unlike the warning properties of other acids. Skin contact with HF concentrations in the 20% to 50% range may not produce symptoms for one to eight hours. With concentrations less than 20%, the latency period may be up to twenty-four hours. A solution of only 1-2% HF exposed to greater than 10% of\u00a0 the body is fatal without medical attention; however dermal burns are not likely immediate.<br />Fluoride ions form insoluble salts with calcium and magnesium in bodily tissue.\u00a0 Soluble salts can form with other cations, which dissociate rapidly causing further disruption and damage to tissue.\u00a0 The severe, throbbing pain associated with HF burns is thought to result from nerve irritation due to potassium cations entering the extracellular space to compensate for reduced calcium ion concentrations.Fluoride poisoning is associated with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), and sudden death. \u00a0<br />Systemic hypocalcemia should be considered a risk whenever the body surface area of skin burns from concentrated hydrofluoric acid exceed 160 cm2 (25 sq.in).), or about the size of the palm of your hand.\u00a0 Concentrated hydrogen fluoride burns can be fatal if only 2% of the body surface area is exposed.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact with the material may produce severely toxic effects; systemic effects may result following absorption and these may be fatal.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p><br /></p> <p>Strong evidence exists that exposure to the material may produce very serious irreversible damage (other than carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and teratogenesis) following a single exposure by swallowing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>Fluoride is a general protoplasmic poison which appears to produce at least four major functional derangements;</p> <p>(1) enzyme inhibition, (2) hypocalcaemia, (3) cardiovascular collapse and (4) specific organ damage.</p> <p>\u00a0Hypocalcaemia which leads to severe reductions in plasma levels of both total calcium and ionic calcium, may appear several hours after exposure producing painful and involuntary muscular contractions (tetany) initially of the extremities (carpopedal spasm, twitching of limb muscles, laryngo-spasm, cardiospasm etc). Cardiovascular collapse is probably the principal cause of death in acute fluoride poisoning with sinus tachycardia the commonest cardiac finding and serious cardiac arrhythmias also common. Poisonings also cause major adverse effects on the brain and kidneys.</p> <p>\u00a0Toxic effects may include headache, excessive salivation, rapid movements of the eyeball (nystagmus) and dilated pupils. Convulsions may occur but lethargy, stupor and coma are more common. Renal pathology (acute congestion) has been described in human casualties.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Severely toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 5 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to vapour or dust with inorganic fluorides may result in fluorosis, with rheumatic symptoms, stiff joints, mottling of tooth enamel. Other signs may include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea or constipation, weight loss, anaemia, weakness and general ill-health. Polyuria and polydipsia may also occur. Exfoliative dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, stomatitis, gastrointestinal and respiratory allergy, and on occasions, central nervous system involvement have all been described.</p> <p>Repeated human exposures to hydrogen fluoride (6 hours/day for 10-50 days) at concentrations as high as 4.7 ppm were tolerated without severe adverse reaction. At concentrations exceeding 3 ppm, researchers noted burning and irritation of the eyes and nose and burning of the skin. Three subjects who inhaled approximately 3 ppm had severe urinary excretions of 6.7-9.4 mg fluoride/day. One epidemiological study was able to demonstrate that there was no significant change in pulmonary function resulting from occupational exposure to average concentrations of 1.02 ppm hydrogen fluoride. A further study indicated a threshold for minimal increases (Grade 1) in bone density (fluorosis) at less than 3.38 mg/m3 (4.3 ppm) hydrogen fluoride. Grade 1 fluorosis resulted in no medically recognised disability. \u00a0Hydrogen fluoride readily penetrates the skin and causes decalcification and corrosion of the bone and underlying tissue (hypocalcaemia). Deaths due to hypocalcaemia have been cited in the literature. Ingestion will cause severe pain and burns in the mouth and throat. Profound and possibly fatal hypocalcaemia is likely to occur unless medical treatment is promptly initiated. \u00a0Symptoms include spasm and twitching of the muscles, high fever, convulsion and general extreme pain. Inhalation may cause corrosion of the throat, nose and lungs, leading to severe inflammation, pulmonary oedema or possible hypocalcaemia. [NIOSHTIC]</p>",
