Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

On the environmental fate side, this includes standard biodegradation studies, advanced simulation studies of removal in treatment systems, and field monitoring data. On the environmental effects side, acute as well as chronic single-species data are available, as well as advanced studies in micro- and mesocosm systems.</p> <p>By means of these higher tier exposure and effects data, it could be shown that the use of AES in household detergents and cleaning products results in risk characterization ratios less than one, indicating no concern, for all environmental compartments.</p> <p>The most frequent initial step in the biodegradation of AES is the cleavage of an ether bond.. The cleavage may take place at any ether bond producing a fatty alcohol or an alcohol ethoxylate and ethylene glycol sulfates of various lengths.. The length of the alkyl chain and the number of EO units apparently do not affect the degree of aerobic biodegradation, but branching of the alkyl chain may hinder the primary biodegradation of AES. AES are degraded readily and completely under aerobic conditions. E.g., for C12-14 AE3S, a rapid primary degradation of 90-100% is reported to take place within a period of 1 to 5 days. In activated sludge simulation tests 67-99% DOC was removed by degradation of C12-14 AE2S and C12-15 AE3S. The ultimate biodegradation of AES has been confirmed in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability.</p> <p>Based on at least one study, AES are not considered to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The chemical structure of AES highly influences the effect on aquatic organisms. The relations between alkyl chain length, number of EO groups and toxicity are complex and not yet resolved, but in general, changes in EO numbers affects toxicity more than changes in the alkyl chain length. In AES with alkyl chains of less than C16, the toxicity tended to decrease with increasing numbers of EO, but this was reversed for alkyl chain lengths above C16. The toxicity of AES thus seems to peak at alkyl chain lengths of C16. In a study of the acute toxicity of various AES (C8 to C19.6 and 1-3 EO) to bluegill sunfish (<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>), the LC50 fell from &gt; 250 mg/l for C8 and 375 mg/l for C10 to 24 mg/l for C13, 4-7 mg/l for C14, 2 mg/l for C15 and 0.3 mg/l for C16, and then increased to 10.8 mg/l for C17.9 and 17 mg/l for C19.6. Reported ranges for EC50 for the acute toxicity of AES to daphnids between 1 and 50 mg/l. However, an EC50 of 0.37 mg/l was observed in a 21-day reproduction test with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna.\u00a0</i>The LC50 values for fish are in the range between 0.39 to 450 mg/l. A LOEC value of 0.22 mg/l has been reported for a chronic life cycle test with a duration of 1 year. The toxicity of AES towards fish seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length for AES with up to 16 carbons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant.

Within each subcategory the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter ion may also influence the physico-chemical behaviour of these chemicals, the chemical reactivity and classification for the purpose of this assessment is not expected to be affected by the difference in counter ion.</p> <p>As ionic substances, all members of this category have extremely low vapor pressures. Calculated values are in the ranges 10-11 to 10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkyl sulfates), 4.3.10-11 to 9.10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkane sulfonates), 2.1.10-13 to 6.9.10-15 hPa (C14-18 alkene sulfonates) and 3.3.10-17 to 5.8.10-19 hPa (C14-18 hydroxy alkane sulfonates). Therefore, they decompose before reaching their theoretical boiling points.</p> <p>Measured water solubilities are available only for alkyl sulfates; they are in the range 196 000 mg/l (C12) to 300 mg/l (C16) and by factors of 50 to 300 higher than calculated values (C12: 617 mg/l, C16: 5 mg/l).</p> <p>As surfactants have a tendency to concentrate at hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundaries rather than to equilibrate between phases log Kow is not a good descriptor of surfactant hydrophobicity and only of limited predictive value for the partitioning of these compounds in the environment.</p> <p>All calculated physico-chemical properties of surfactants should be treated with caution, because the estimation models do not take into account surfactant properties. In addition, the results are doubtful for ionic substances.</p> <p>Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties the target compartment for the substances of this category is the hydrosphere. Based on the ionic structure partitioning into the atmosphere can be excluded. In water, the compounds are stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions.</p> <p>Taking into account the low BCF factors (&lt;73) that were determined for (up to) C16-alkyl sulfates, any significant bioaccumulation is not expected.</p> <p>Soil sorption increases with chain length. Strong sorption on soils would be expected for chain length C14 upwards. Sediment concentrations were between 0.0035 and 0.021 mg/kg dw indicating that accumulation in sediments is low. Under certain conditions of reduced moisture in soil, i.e. in arid or semi-arid regions, accumulation in soil cannot be excluded.</p> <p>The substances of this category are readily biodegradable. Significant biodegradation of alkyl sulfates in the raw sewage, i.e. in the sewer system before reaching the (waste-water treatment plant (WWTPs) is very likely. The substances of this category are quantitatively removed in WWTPs, mainly by biodegradation. Because of the anaerobic degradation of alkyl sulfates in sewage sludge, exposure of agricultural soils due to application of sludge as fertiliser is not expected. However, for alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates this exposure pathway cannot be excluded due to their recalcitrant or limited anaerobic degradability.</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions is anticipated to follow the same pathway as for the aerobic degradation.</p> <p>Primary and secondary AS generally undergo complete primary biodegradation within a few days followed by a rapid ultimate biodegradation. Branched AS are also degraded quite rapidly, but multiple branchings of the alkyl chain considerably reduce the rate and extent of primary biodegradation. There are numerous studies confirming the aerobic biodegradability of AS, and linear primary AS exceeds all other anionic surfactants in the rate of primary and ultimate biodegradation. Also secondary AS are normally readily biodegradable as, e.g., the oxygen uptake from biodegradation of a linear secondary C10-13 AS corresponded to 77% ThOD in 22 days. Some highly branched AS being poorly primary biodegradable may also resist ultimate biodegradation.</p> <p>Both linear and 2-alkyl-branched primary AS are degraded to a high extent under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>AS are generally considered to have a low potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:\u00a0</b>Alkane sulfonate anionics (SAS) undergo rapid primary biodegradation with Methylene Blue Active Substance (MBAS) removal higher than 90% within a few days. Removal of 96% were seen in the OECD screening test for primary biodegradation. In activated sludge simulation tests, 96% of C10-18 SAS was removed, while the parent C13-18 SAS was removed by 83-96%.</p> <p>Alkyl sulfonates are not degraded under anoxic conditions</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates:\u00a0</b>alpha-Olefine sulfonates (AOS) AOS undergo rapid primary biodegradability with methylene blue active substances ( MBAS) removal between 95 and 100% in 2 to 8 days in river water and inoculated media. The ultimate biodegradability of AOS exceeds the pass requirements in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability. \u00a0report 85% DOC removal in the modified OECD screening test, 85% ThOD in the closed bottle test, and 65-80% ThCO2 in the Sturm test. In activated sludge simulation tests, AOS was removed by 100% MBAS and 88% DOC. The alkene sulfonates and hydroxyalkane sulfonates in commercial AOS are both ultimately biodegraded as approximately 84% ThCO2 was obtained during degradation of C14, C16, and C18 within 27 days, whereas the corresponding 3-hydroxyalkane sulfonates were degraded by approximately 86% under the same conditions.</p> <p>AOS are not readily degradable under anaerobic conditions Reports indicate a range of 31% to 43% MBAS removal under anoxic conditions indicating primary biodegradation</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity is influenced by a number of parameters, the length of the alkyl chain being most important. The pH and temperature of water bodies can affect the EC/LC50 values for compounds that contain ammonium ions.</p> <p>The most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates were invertebrates, followed by fish. Algae proved to be less sensitive. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (NOEC = 0.045 mg/l).</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow - fry 10.2 mg/l; juvenile 17 mg/l; adult 22.5 mg/l; rainbow trout 4.6 mg/l (static)</p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of AS seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length. This has been shown for daphnids and for some fish species. An overall comparison of the acute toxicity between the primary and secondary AS shows only minor differences in the toxicity, although only a few studies for comparison are available.</p> <p>The available data describing the toxicity of AS towards algae indicate that the lowest EC50 values range between 1 and 10 mg/l for C12 AS</p> <p>The toxicity of AS towards invertebrates has mainly been examined in tests with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity of AS to Daphnia magna increased with increasing alkyl chain length. It has been shown that during degradation of C12 AS, the toxicity first increased to a maximum after 30 hours and then fell to almost a negligible value. The increase in toxicity was explained by the formation of the more toxic dodecanoic acid which is rapidly transformed to other and less toxic metabolites.</p> <p>Studies showed that the 24 h-LC50 values for killifish in distilled water decreased by a factor of about 10 when the alkyl chain was increased by two carbon atoms. C16 was 10 times more toxic than C14, which was about 10 times more toxic than C12 AS.</p> <p>The toxicity of AS to fish has been demonstrated to increase with increasing alkyl chain length as also seen in studies with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity on Daphnia magna has been determined for chain length C8-C14. Results were comparable to alkyl sulfates in the range between C8 and C10, while C12 and C14 are significantly less toxic. Chronic data obtained for C12 alkane sulfonate sodium and C12-alkyl sulfate sodium with the rotifer\u00a0<i>Brachionus calicyflorus</i>\u00a0similarly show that alkane sulfonates might be less toxic than alkyl sulfates. C16 and C18 alkane sulfonates are assumed to exhibit the same toxicity than alkyl sulfates of comparable chain lengths. No data are available concerning the toxicity of alkane sulfonates on fish and algae. However, a similar toxicity might be assumed because of structural and physico-chemical similarities between the three subcategories</p> <p>Whereas most correlations between AS structure and toxicity show an increasing toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length, the budding in Hydra attenuata was apparently more affected by C10 AS than by C12, C14, and C16 AS. The authors suggested that the decrease in toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length was attributable to reduced solubility in water</p> <p>Tests on the toxicity to microorganisms were only conducted with alkyl sulfates as test substances. A test on the inhibition of respiration of activated sludge resulted in an 3 h-EC50 of 135 mg/l (nominally). The lowest effect value for protozoa was obtained from a test on\u00a0<i>Uronema parduczi</i>\u00a0using C12-alkyl sulfate sodium - \u00a0the 20 h-EC5 was 0.75 mg/l.</p> <p>Experimental test results on benthic organisms in a water-sediment system are not available. However, due to sediment-water partitioning coefficients Kd &lt; 350, no significant risk for organisms in this compartment is to be expected.</p> <p>Data indicate that toxic effects on soil organisms might only be expected at high concentrations for alkyl sulfates. Toxicity of alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates can not be assessed because test results for terrestrial organisms are not available.</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates,</b>\u00a0reliable short-term tests on fish, invertebrates and algae are available. The results indicate that toxicity is increasing as the alkyl chain length increases. The lowest available effect value is the 96 h-LC50 = 0.5 mg/l, determined in tests on\u00a0<i>Oryzias latipes, Rasbora heteromorpha</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Salmo trutta</i></p> <p>Algae show toxic effects to growth when exposed 10-100 mg/l for C14-18 AOS.</p> <p>EC50 values for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>\u00a0have been determined within the range 5-50 mg/l for C14-18 AOS . Another study with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>, showed EC50 values of 16.6 mg/l for C14-16 AOS and 7.7 mg/l for C16-18 AOS.</p> <p>Studies performed with fish show that the higher homologues of AOS are more toxic than the lower ones. This has been illustrated for different fish species (LC50 (96 h) range 0.5-5.3 mg/l)</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:</b>\u00a0The toxicity of various SAS homologues was determined in tests with\u00a0<i>Chlamydomonas variabilis</i><b><i>.</i></b>\u00a0After 24 hours of exposure at 20 C, there was a tendency to an increased toxicity with increasing chain length.

Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with some concentrated anionic surfactants/ hydrotropes produces corneal damage, in some cases severe. Low concentrations may produce immediate discomfort, conjunctival hyperaemia, and oedema of the corneal epithelium. Healing may take several days. Temporary clouding of the cornea may occur.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Anionic surfactants/ hydrotropes generally produce skin reactions following the removal of natural oils. The skin may appear red and may become sore. Papular dermatitis may also develop. Sensitive individuals may exhibit cracking, scaling and blistering.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of anionic surfactants/ hydrotropes may produce diarrhoea, intestinal distension and occasional vomiting. Lethal doses in animals range from 1 to 5 gm/kg.</p> <p>Organo-sulfates are generally poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract but have the ability to attract water and as a result may produce diarrhoea. Systemically they are\u00a0<font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>highly toxic</b></font>. At higher concentrations they are mutagenic and may be carcinogenic.</p> <p>Human metabolism allows detoxification of ammonia, however toxic effects appear if this mechanism is overwhelmed by other than small doses.\u00a0</p> <p>Ingestion of ammonium salts may produce local irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Very large doses of ammonium salts may produce a drop in blood pressure, collapse, central nervous system disorders, spasms, narcosis, respiratory paralysis and haemolysis.</p> <p>Large doses of ammonium salts may be sufficiently absorbed to produce diuresis and systemic ammonia poisoning. Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

In addition they function as hair conditioning agents,\r\nfunctional surfactants, thickeners and bacteriostatic agents.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Amphoteric surfactants\r\n(amphiphiles) have dual functional groups (both acidic and basic groups) in the\r\nsame molecule. They are polar substances that have a high solubility in water\r\nbut a poor solubility in most organic solvents. They are electrically neutral\r\n(zwitterions) but carry positive and negative charges on different atoms in an\r\naqueous solution. They exist mostly as zwitterions in a certain pH range but\r\ndepending on the pH value, the substances can have anionic or cationic\r\nproperties outside the zwitterionic range. In the presence of acids, they will\r\naccept the hydrogen ions but they will donate hydrogen ions to the solution in\r\nthe presence of bases, which balances the pH. Such actions make buffer\r\nsolutions which resist change to the pH. Amphoteric (amphiphilic) surfactants\r\nchange their charge according to the pH of the solution; this affects\r\nproperties such as foaming, wetting and detergency through a surface action that\r\nexerts both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. In biochemistry amphoteric\r\nsurfactants are used as\u00a0 detergents for purifying, cleansing and for their\u00a0\r\nantimicrobial effects. Alkylbetaines and amino-oxides are typical amphoteric\r\nsurfactants.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines are primarily used in\r\npersonal care products like, e.g. hair shampoos, liquid soaps, and cleansing\r\nlotions. Other applications include all-purpose cleaning agents, hand\r\ndishwashing agents, and special textile detergents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In chemistry a betaine is any\r\nneutral chemical compound with a positively charged cationic functional group\r\nsuch as a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation (generally: onium ions)\r\nwhich bears no hydrogen atom and with a negatively charged functional group\r\nsuch as a carboxylate group which may not be adjacent to the cationic site. A\r\nbetaine thus may be a specific type of zwitterion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In biological systems, many\r\nnaturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized\r\nor taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic\r\nstress, drought, high salinity or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation\r\nof betaines, non-perturbing to enzyme function, protein structure and membrane\r\nintegrity, permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects\r\nof dehydration. It is also a methyl donor of increasingly recognised\r\nsignificance in biology.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines may function to reduce\r\nthe concentration of homocysteine, a homolog of the naturally occurring amino\r\nacid cysteine. High circulating levels of homocysteine may be harmful to blood\r\nvessels and thus contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. This\r\nhypothesis is controversial as it has not yet been established whether\r\nhomocysteine itself is harmful or is just an indicator of increased risk for\r\ncardiovascular disease</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phosphonium betaines are\r\nintermediates in the Wittig reaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The addition of betaine to\r\npolymerase chain reactions improves the amplification of DNA by reducing the\r\nformation of secondary structure in GC-rich regions. The addition of betaine\r\nhas been reported to enhance the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction\r\nby eliminating the base pair composition dependence of DNA melting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most betaines are characterized\r\nby a fully quaternised nitrogen. In alkyl betaines, one of the methyl groups in\r\nthe \u2018betaine\u2019 structure (<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylglycine) is replaced by a linear\r\nalkyl chain. A special type of betaines is the hydroxysulfobetaines in which\r\nthe carboxylic group of alkyl betaine is replaced by sulfonate and a\r\nhydroxy-group is inserted in the hydrophilic part of the molecule. In\r\nalkylamido betaines, an amide group is inserted as a link between the\r\nhydrophobic alkyl chain and the hydrophilic moiety. The most commonly used\r\nalkylamido betaine is alkylamidopropyl betaine (e.g., cocoamidopropyl betaine),\r\nwhereas alkylamidoethyl betaines are used in smaller amounts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Representative structures include</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RN+(CH3)2CH2COO- (alkyl betaine)\r\nand </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RC(=O)NH(CH3)2N+(CH3)CH3-COO-\r\n(alkylamidopropyl betaine)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines and closely related\r\nsultaines are \"pseudo-amphoteric\" surfactants as the nitrogen moiety\r\nalways has a net positive charge and the molecules can never become anionic at\r\nhigh pHs</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines/ sultaines typically\r\ncontain 6-8% salt (as sodium chloride for example) as by-products of their\r\nsynthesis. These salts act to enlarge the effective size of the surfactant\r\nmicelles and thus viscosity increases</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since betaines/ sultaines\r\npermanently have positively charged nitrogen, the negatively charged end of the\r\nanionic surfactant associates with it to form a large surfactant complex and\r\nthe viscosity increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These surfactants also have other\r\nbenefits when used in shampoos; they improve foam and can increase hair\r\nconditioning due to their substantively to hair. It has also been reported\r\n(controversially) that they can actually decrease the irritation potential of\r\nanionics (once again due to the formation of a surfactant complex) </span></p>",

That makes the substance act like a cationic surfactant in an acid solution, whereas it in an alkaline solution will not carry any net charge but continue to form its inner salt, it does not become a negatively charged ion.

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For cationic surfactants:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Although cationic surfactants will sorb onto sludge particles and eventually reach the digester during the treatment of wastewater sludge, there is very limited information about the biodegradability of these compounds under anoxic conditions. It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.\u00a0</p> <p>The numerous studies of aquatic toxicity, many of which were conducted in natural waters with and without added effluents, indicate that the source and composition of the test water dramatically affects the toxicity of the test substance. These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants.\u00a0</p> <p>Zwitterionic (amphoteric) substances, such as betaines, sulfobetaines  and taurines, may be phytotoxic. Because they are implicated in the  disruption of cell membranes,\u00a0 toxic effects on marine flora and fauna  (of a secondary nature) may ensue.<br />Surfactants show a complex  solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer concentration, and  hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting value at the  critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains approximately constant  as the total concentration is further increased. For ecotoxicological  models requiring a solubility value, the critical micelle concentration  is therefore the appropriate parameter describing water solubility of  surface active materials<br />Surfactants can form dispersions or  emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic toxicity studies is  difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution preparation. Micelle  formation can result in an overestimation of the bioavailable fraction  even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This presents significant  problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test results for surface  active materials. The so-called the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  is related to surface tension produced by the\u00a0 substance and is key  value for actual water solubility of the substance.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The primary biodegradability of betaines approaches 100% as, e.g., the loss of surface-activity attained 100% for C12 alkyl betaine, 98% for cocoamidopropyl betaine, and 96 and 100% for C14-15 hydroxysulfobetaine. The results from ultimate biodegradability tests of alkyl betaines show some variation with degradation percentages below and above the pass level for ready biodegradability. However, taken as a whole, \u00a0both alkyl betaines and cocoalkylamido betaines can be regarded as readily biodegradable. In contrast the hydroxysulfobetaines are probably not readily biodegradable in standard screening tests as indicated by a biodegradability of 40 and 47% of ThOD in the closed bottle test.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The knowledge about the biodegradability of betaines under anoxic conditions is relatively scarce. \u00a0Literature searches indicates that sulfate-reducing marine bacteria belonging to the genus\u00a0<i>Desulfobacterium</i>\u00a0are able to grow on betaine with the stoichiometric formation of\u00a0<i>N,N</i>-dimethylglycine. One study indicated that betaine was anaerobically degraded to methylamine in sewage sludge at a betaine concentration of 2 g/l and a solids concentration of 3.3 g/l. The anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine was examine by using the ISO 11734 screening test. Under the methanogenic test conditions, the ultimate biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine attained 45 and 75% of ThGP after 28 and 56 days, respectively, at the applied test concentration of 14.4 mg C/l\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of betaines varies considerably, even within the same species, which is particularly evident by evaluating the EC50 values determined for the green alga\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus</i>. For this species, the EC50 obtained in tests with cocoamidopropyl betaine are between 0.55 and 48 mg/l. The geometric mean of the EC50 obtained for\u00a0<i>S. subspicatus\u00a0</i>is 3.1 mg/l, when the values 0.55, 1.84, and 30 mg/l are used . The EC/LC50 of alkyl and cocoamidopropyl betaines towards crustaceans and fish are between 1 and 100 mg/l.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

In an\r\noccupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not\r\nthought to be cause for concern.</span></p> <p>The very bitter taste is likely to give early warning of accidental ingestion. Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure. Cloudy swelling, patchy necrosis and fatty infiltration in such visceral organs as the heart, liver and kidneys shows at death.</p> <p>\u00a0Rats fed repeatedly on a similar material (a C12-C16 alkyl derivative), over several weeks, died of inanition associated with chronic diarrhoea; at autopsy the only lesion found was focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the gastric mucosa.

In sufficient quantity they may produce central nervous symptoms or circulatory shock which causes restlessness, confusion, hypotension, muscle weakness, collapse, convulsions, respiratory paralysis, cyanosis and coma.

Therefore, read-across  of exposure-related observations in humans from CAS 683-10-3 is  justified. Data from several human closed patch tests demonstrate skin  irritation in humans ranging from mild to strong under occlusive  conditions even with concentrations as low as 1%. In contrast, exposure  to 0.1% under open conditions did not induce any positive skin  reactions. <br />Information on skin sensitisation in humans is available  from a closed human patch test with CAS 683-10-3. After an induction  period of 6 days with 0.1% of active ingredient, followed by a  treatment-free period of 10 days, the volunteers were challenged under  occlusive conditions for 24 hours. No reactions were observed  immediately after challenge; during the next 4 days only irritation  reactions were observed. <br />This finding was further supported by  industrial medical monitoring data.\u00a0 Workers involved in the production  of CAS 683-10-3 are routinely checked every 3 years for signs of skin  sensitisation, respiratory irritation, skin irritation and eye  irritation. During these examinations no signs of the aforementioned  disorders were observed which were related to the test substance. <br />Moreover,  a study focusing on dermal uptake of C12-alkyldimethyl betaine) into  human skin and the effects of surfactants on skin barrier function  demonstrated that only up to 0.4% of the applied dose was absorbed  within 30 minutes of exposure, with absorbance being dependent on the  concentration applied. Tape stripping of the skin revealed that the  administered test substance was primarily located in the outer stratum  corneum layer<br />Test material does not demonstrate mutagenic or clastogenic effects in bacteria or mammalian cells in vitro<br />\" REACH Dossier<br />Amphoteric  surfactants are easily absorbed in the intestine and are excreted  partly unchanged via the faeces. Metabolisation to CO2 and short-chained  fatty acids also occur. No tendency to accumulation in the organism or  storage of betaines in certain organs has been detected. Betaines  generally have a low acute toxicity. E.g., LD50 values for  cocoamidopropylbetaine (30% solution) by oral administration have been  determined to 4,910 mg/kg body weight in rats.<br />Betaines do not carry  any net charge, and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds  with proteins in the skin. This may be the explanation for the low  protein denaturation potential of betaines as the ion-binding of other  surfactants contributes to denaturation. In combination with anionic  surfactants a positive synergistic effect with regard to skin  compatibility is often found. Compared to a 20% solution of C12 alkyl  sulfate (AS; sodium lauryl sulfate) alone, decreased erythema was  observed for the combination of 20% C12 AS and 10% cocoamidopropyl  betaine one hour after the removal of patches. The combination of  cocoamidopropyl betaine and C12 AS also reduced swelling of the skin,  and generally interactions between amphoterics and AS produce less  swelling and result in milder skin reactions. Concentrated betaines are  expected to be irritant to skin and eyes. Diluted solutions (3-10%) are  not irritant to skin, but they are mildly irritant to the eyes (4.5%)<br />No  evidence of delayed contact hypersensitivity was found in guinea pigs  after topically administrated solutions of 10% cocoamidopropyl betaine  by using the Magnusson-Kligman maximization test. Various instances of  contact allergy to cocoamidopropyl betaine have been reported. In all of  the reports it was concluded that the observed skin reactions were due  to the presence of 3-dimethylaminopropylamine which is an impurity in  cocoamidopropyl betaine. This impurity is an intermediate in the  synthesis of alkylamidopropyldimethylamines that are intermediates in  the synthesis of the corresponding alkylamido betaines.<br />Cocoamidopropyl  betaine was proven to be non-mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the  Ames Salmonella/microsome reverse mutation assay. Short-term  genotoxicity tests have shown negative results of mutagenicity for  lauryl betaine in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

There\r\nare four major fatty acid alkanolamides (also known as alkylolamides).\r\nmonoethanolamide (MEA); diethanolamide (DEA); monoisopropanolamide (MIPA) and\r\nethoxylated or PEG alkanolamides. Each group has its own specific functions and\r\nuses in various formulations. In forming the alkanolamide an alkanolamine soap\r\nis first formed and then dehydrated to form the alkanolamide. At the same time\r\nsignificant quantities of amine esters and amide esters are formed by side\r\nreactions.

The amide may either be monoethanolamide (MEA),\r\ndiethanolamide (DEA), or monoisopropanolamide (MIPA). Representative structures\r\nof FAA are indicated below. The alkyl chain usually contains 12 to 18 carbon\r\natoms. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">FAAs can be represented as\r\nR-C(=O)-N(R)'R\" .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">FAAs which contain a saturated or\r\nunsaturated alkyl chain derived from a fatty acid, can be divided into three\r\ncategories (based on the following notation. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">The first is <i>primary monoamides </i>in which R is a fatty alkyl\r\nor alkenyl chain of C5-C23 and R' =R''= H. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">The second is <i>substituted monoamides, </i>including secondary,\r\ntertiary, and alkanolamides in which R is a fatty alkyl or alkenyl chain of\r\nC5-C23; R' and R\" may be a hydrogen, fatty alkyl, aryl, or alkylene oxide\r\ncondensation groups with at least one alkyl, aryl, or alkylene oxide group. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">The third category is<i> bisamides</i> where R groups are fatty\r\nalkyl or alkenyl chains.

With tertiary amides (disubstituted amides),\r\nhydrogen bonding is not possible, as exhibited by their increased solubility\r\nand lower melting points. Many fatty acid amides are essentially insoluble in\r\nwater. Amides have a strong tendency to reduce friction on various surfaces by\r\nforming a layer on surfaces. This coating action may be attributed to their\r\nhydrophobic character and strong hydrogen bonding. Fatty acid amides in general\r\nare stable to elevated processing temperatures, air oxidation, and dilute acids\r\nand bases. Alkanolamides are made from triglycerides or fatty acid methyl\r\nesters reacted with monoethanolamine or diethanolamine that then can be\r\nethoxylated with ethylene oxide under basic catalyses. Common products are\r\nstearamide, cocamide, ethylene bis(stearamide), cocamide, DEA or MEA,\r\ncocamidopropyl dimethyl amine, and cocamide monoethanolamine ethoxylate</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Regardless of the carbon number,\r\nthe melting point of most saturated fatty acid amides falls in a range of 100\r\nto 110 C. In contrast, the melting point of unsaturated fatty acid amides is\r\nsignificantly affected by the carbon number of such fatty acid amides; their\r\nmelting points fall in a range of 70 to 85 C relative to the carbon number in a\r\nrange of 18 to 22.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monoisopropanolamides are\r\ngenerally liquid at ambient temperatures..</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Commercial alkanolamides\r\ngenerally contain high levels of reaction byproducts which makes many water\r\nsoluble.</span></p>",

Many of the\r\nECOSAR model estimates for the acute toxicity endpoints indicate the chemicals\r\nare \u201cnot toxic at solubility\u201d. However, for surfactants such as the FND Amides\r\nthe acute aquatic toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects\r\nof the surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical\r\ntoxicity.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids.

There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <p>Experience indicates that the following polymers are suitable as glove materials for protection against undissolved, dry solids, where abrasive particles are not present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>polychloroprene. </li>\n<li>nitrile rubber. </li>\n<li>butyl rubber. </li>\n<li>fluorocaoutchouc. </li>\n<li>polyvinyl chloride. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gloves should be examined for wear and/ or degradation constantly.</p>"

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Upon this release a biocidal substance can pass a sewage\r\ntreatment plant (STP) and, based on its physical chemical properties, partition\r\nto sewage sludge, which in turn can be used for soil amendments thereby\r\nreleasing the substance into the soil compartment. Alternatively, the substance\r\ncan remain in the water phase in the STP and subsequently end up in the water\r\ncompartment such as surface water etc. Risk assessment for the environment\r\nfocuses on protecting the environmental compartments (air, water and soil) by\r\nperforming hazard assessments on key species, which represent the food chain\r\nwithin the specific compartment. Of special concern is a well functioning STP,\r\nwhich is elemental in many removal processes. The large variety in biocidal\r\napplications leads to complicated exposure scenarios that need to reflect the\r\nintended use and possible degradation pathways, in order to perform an accurate\r\nrisk assessment for the environment.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>CEL TWA: 0.1 mg/m3; STEL 0.3 mg/m3 total isothiazolinones (Rohm and Haas)</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce toxic effects.</p>",

Instillation of 0.1 ml of an aqueous solution containing 560 ppm isothiazolinone into rabbit eye did not produce irritation whereas concentrations, typically around 3% and 5.5 %, were severely irritating or corrosive to the eye..

Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Isothiazolinones are moderately to highly toxic by oral administration.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Upon this release a biocidal substance can pass a sewage\r\ntreatment plant (STP) and, based on its physical chemical properties, partition\r\nto sewage sludge, which in turn can be used for soil amendments thereby\r\nreleasing the substance into the soil compartment. Alternatively, the substance\r\ncan remain in the water phase in the STP and subsequently end up in the water\r\ncompartment such as surface water etc. Risk assessment for the environment\r\nfocuses on protecting the environmental compartments (air, water and soil) by\r\nperforming hazard assessments on key species, which represent the food chain\r\nwithin the specific compartment. Of special concern is a well functioning STP,\r\nwhich is elemental in many removal processes. The large variety in biocidal\r\napplications leads to complicated exposure scenarios that need to reflect the\r\nintended use and possible degradation pathways, in order to perform an accurate\r\nrisk assessment for the environment.

Furthermore, the proposed metabolites of MI and CMI are considered to have a low aquatic toxicity on the basis of QSAR estimates and the measured toxicity of the structurally related N-(n-octyl) malonamic acid.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>|Octanol/ water coefficient = -0.486 (log P)|Biodegradation (aquatic metabolism)|half life t1/2 (aerobic) =9.1 hours|as mixed isothiazolinones|Rainbow trout LC50(96hr): = 0.19 mg/L.|Bluegill sunfish LC50(96hr): = 0.28 ml/L.|Daphnia EC50(48hr): = 0.16 mg/L.|Algal (Selenastrum) EC50: 0.018 mg/L.",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit.
