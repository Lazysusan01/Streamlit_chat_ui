Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For epichlorohydrin</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 0.08 ppm</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for epichlorohydrin, measuring in excess of 5 ppm, are commercially available.</p> <p>Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to minimise the potential for adverse respiratory, liver, kidney effects.

They also suggested\r\nthat \"it is also possible that bisphenol A contributes to a reduction in\r\nthe production of sperm and the increase in the incidence of testicular cancer\r\nin adults that have been observed in recent decades\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One review has concluded that\r\nobesity may be increased as a function of bisphenol A exposure, which\r\n\"...merits concern among scientists and public health officials\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One study demonstrated that\r\nadverse neurological effects occur in non-human primates regularly exposed to\r\nbisphenol A at levels equal to the United States Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA) maximum safe dose of 50 ug/kg/day This research found a\r\nconnection between bisphenol A and interference with brain cell connections\r\nvital to memory, learning, and mood.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A further review concluded that\r\nbisphenol-A has been shown to bind to thyroid hormone receptor and perhaps have\r\nselective effects on its functions. Carcinogenicity studies have shown\r\nincreases in leukaemia and testicular interstitial cell tumours in male rats.\r\nHowever, \"these studies have not been considered as convincing evidence of\r\na potential cancer risk because of the doubtful statistical significance of the\r\nsmall differences in incidences from controls\". Another in vitro study has\r\nconcluded that bisphenol A is able to induce neoplastic transformation in human\r\nbreast epithelial cells.[whilst a further study concluded that maternal oral\r\nexposure to low concentrations of bisphenol A, during lactation, increases\r\nmammary carcinogenesis in a rodent model. In vitro studies have suggested that\r\nbisphenol A can promote the growth of neuroblastoma cells and potently promotes\r\ninvasion and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells. Newborn rats exposed to a\r\nlow-dose of bisphenol A (10 ug/kg) showed increased prostate cancer susceptibility\r\nwhen adults. At least one study has suggested that bisphenol A suppresses DNA\r\nmethylation which is involved in epigenetic changes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bisphenol A is the isopropyl\r\nadduct of 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl oxide (DHDPO). A series of DHDPO analogues\r\nhave been investigated as potential oestrogen receptor/anti-tumour drug\r\ncarriers in the development of a class of therapeutic drugs called\r\n\"cytostatic hormones\". Oestrogenic activity is induced with 1 to 100\r\nmg/kg body weight in animal models. Bisphenol A sealants are frequently used in\r\ndentistry for treatment of dental pits and fissures. Samples of saliva\r\ncollected from dental patients during a 1-hour period following application\r\ncontain the monomer. A bisphenol-A sealant has been shown to be oestrogenic in\r\nvitro; such sealants may represent an additional source of xenoestrogens in\r\nhumans and may be the cause of additional concerns in children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Concerns have been raised about\r\nthe possible developmental effects on the foetus/embryo or neonate resulting\r\nfrom the leaching of bisphenol A from epoxy linings in metal cans which come in\r\ncontact with food-stuffs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Many drugs, including naproxen,\r\nsalicylic acid, carbamazepine and mefenamic acid can, in vitro, significantly\r\ninhibit bisphenol A glucuronidation (detoxification).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">BPA belongs to the list of\r\ncompounds having this property as the rodent models have shown that BPA\r\nexposure is linked with increased body weigh (obesogens)t. Several mechanisms\r\ncan help explain the effect of BPA on body weight increase.\u00a0 A possible\u00a0 mechanism\r\nleading to triglyceride accumulation is the decreased production of the hormone\r\nadiponectin from all human adipose tissue tested when exposed to very low\r\nlevels (below nanomolar range) of BPA in cell or explant culture settings . The\r\nexpression of leptin as well as several enzymes and transcription factors is\r\nalso affected by BPA exposure in vivo as well as in vitro. Together, the\r\naltered expression and activity of these important mediators of fat metabolism\r\ncould explain the increase in weight following BPA exposure in rodent models.\r\nThese results also suggest that, together with other obesogens, low,\r\nenvironmentally relevant levels of BPA may contribute to the human obesity\r\nphenomenon.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers\r\n(BADGEs) produce sensitisation dermatitis characterised by a papular, vesicular\r\neczema with considerable itching of the back of the hand, the forearm and face\r\nand neck.

Oxiranes (including glycidyl ethers and alkyl oxides, and epoxides) exhibit common characteristics with respect to environmental fate and ecotoxicology. One such oxirane is ethyloxirane and data presented here may be taken as representative.</p> <p>for 1,2-butylene oxide (ethyloxirane):</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b>Ethyloxirane is highly soluble in water and has a very low soil-adsorption coefficient, which suggests that if released to water, adsorption of ethyloxirane to sediment and suspended solids is not expected. Volatilisation of ethyloxirane from water surfaces would be expected based on the moderate estimated Henry's Law constant. If ethyloxirane is released to soil, it is expected to have low adsorption and thus very high mobility. Volatilisation from moist soil and dry soil surfaces is expected, based on its vapour pressure. It is expected that ethyloxirane exists solely as a vapour in ambient atmosphere, based on its very high vapour pressure. Ethyloxirane may also be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition processes, considering its relatively high water solubility.</p> <p><b>Persistence:\u00a0</b>The half-life in air is about 5.6 days from the reaction of ethyloxirane with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals which indicates that this chemical meets the persistence criterion in air (half-life of = 2 days)*.</p> <p>Ethyloxirane is hydrolysable, with a half-life of 6.5 days, and biodegradable up to 100% degradation and is not expected to persist in water. A further model-predicted biodegradation half-life of 15 days in water \u00a0was obtained and used to predict the half-life of this chemical in soil and sediment by applying Boethling's extrapolation factors ( t1/2water : t1/2 soil : t1/2sediment = 1: 1: 4 ) (Boethling 1995). According to these values, it can be concluded that ethyloxirane does not meet the persistence criteria in water and soil (half-lives = 182 days) and sediments (half-life = 365 days).</p> <p>Experimental and modelled log Kow values of 0.68 and 0.86, respectively, indicate that the potential for bioaccumulation of ethyloxirane in organisms is likely to be low. Modelled bioaccumulation -factor (BAF) and bioconcentration -factor (BCF) values of 1 to 17 L/kg indicate that ethyloxirane does not meet the bioaccumulation criteria (BCF/BAF = 5000)*</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Experimental ecotoxicological data for ethyloxirane (OECD 2001) indicate low to moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms. For fish and water flea, acute LC50/EC50 values vary within a narrow range of 70-215 mg/L; for algae, toxicity values exceed 500 mg/L, while for bacteria they are close to 5000 mg/L\u00a0</p> <p><i><br /></i></p> <p><i>* Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</i>\u00a0(Canada 2000).</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental\r\ntoxicity is a function of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Pow,\r\nlog Kow).

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For epichlorohydrin</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 0.08 ppm</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for epichlorohydrin, measuring in excess of 5 ppm, are commercially available.</p> <p>Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to minimise the potential for adverse respiratory, liver, kidney effects.

Those glycidyl ethers that have been investigated in long  term studies exhibit more or less marked carcinogenic potential.  Alkylating agents may damage the stem cell which acts as the precursor  to components of the blood. Loss of the stem cell may result in  pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and  platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the  individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular  leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder  involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red  blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest.

Haemopoietic abnormalities following exposure to glycidyl  ethers, including alteration of the leukocyte count, atrophy of lymphoid  tissue, and bone marrow cytotoxicity have also been reported. These  abnormalities were usually observed along with pneumonia and/or toxemia,  and therefore may be secondary effects. However, especially in light of  the generalized reduction in leukocytes and the atrophy of lymphoid  tissues, the observed haemopoietic abnormalities may have been  predisposing factors to pneumonia. While none of the individual research  reports are conclusive with respect to the ability of glycidyl ethers  to produce permanent changes to the testes or haemopoietic system in  laboratory animals, the pattern of displayed effects is reason for  concern<br />Glycidyl ethers have been shown to cause allergic contact  dermatitis in humans.

Necrosis of the mucous membranes of the nasal  cavities was induced in mice exposed to allyl glycidyl ether. \u00a0<br />A  study of workers with mixed exposures was inconclusive with regard to  the effects of specific glycidyl ethers. Phenyl glycidyl ether, but not  n-butyl glycidyl ether, induced morphological transformation in  mammalian cells in vitro. n-Butyl glycidyl ether induced micronuclei in  mice in vivo following intraperitoneal but not oral administration.  Phenyl glycidyl ether did not induce micronuclei or chromosomal  aberrations in vivo or chromosomal aberrations in animal cells in vitro.  Alkyl C12 or C14 glycidyl ether did not induce DNA damage in cultured  human cells or mutation in cultured animal cells. Allyl glycidyl ether  induced mutation in Drosophila.

A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Nevertheless, adverse systemic effects have been produced following exposure of animals by at least one other route and good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Body content of titanium is presumed to be high (because titanium occupies fourth place in occurrence in the earth's surface) and is reported to be general in all organs of the body. Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). A further as yet unexplored mechanism may involve substitution by titanium for several metals (such as vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc) which perform essential biologic functions; all have a similar atomic radius</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",
