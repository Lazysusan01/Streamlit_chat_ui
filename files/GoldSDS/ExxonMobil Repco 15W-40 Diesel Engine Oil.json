Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture.

The low water solubility is consistent with the high lipophilic nature of these substances.\u00a0</p> <p>Members of the zinc dialkyldithiophosphate category, described here, contain alkyl chain lengths that range from C3-10, or tetrapropenylphenol (range = C10-15, C12 enriched). It is common for zinc dialkyldithiophosphates to contain mixed alkyl esters (e.g., C4, C5), although derivatives with single chain lengths (e.g., C8) are included in the category . As a result of this diversity in alkyl side chain length, the molecular weight distribution for the members of the category is broad, 578 to 1303 gm/mol. Due to the predominant influence of carbon chain length on molecular weight.</p> <p>Vapour pressures for the zinc dialkyldithiophosphates are thought to be less than 0.5 mm Hg. \u00a0</p> <p>Unpublished data for a commercial zinc dialkyldithiophosphate with an alkyl group less than C8 indicates a water solubility of 1.6 mg/L. The zinc dialkyldithiophosphates are generally regarded to be poorly soluble in water.</p> <p>Unpublished company data on a commercial zinc dialkyldithiophosphate with a carbon chain length of less than eight yielded a log Kow value of 2.49. Longer chain materials are likely to have higher octanol/water partition coefficients. The log Kow is a measure of the lipophilicity of a substance and is used as a surrogate indicator of the potential of a chemical substance to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. While Log Kow is a good predictor of bioaccumulation for nonpolar organic compounds, the mechanisms for uptake and depuration of metals and metal compounds are very complex and variable. For metal compounds, the Log Kow data are not indicative of the bioaccumulation potential .</p> <p><b>\u00a0Fate and Transport Characteristics.</b>\u00a0Members of this category are expected to be poorly biodegradable.</p> <p>The members of the category are resistant to hydrolysis at room temperature because they lack readily hydrolysable moieties. When heated hydrolytic degradation results in the formation of the phosphorothioic acid ester and hydrogen sulfide. Continued heating at high temperatures results in the formation of the mono-ester and eventually, phosphorothioic acid itself.</p> <p>These materials are known to be thermally labile at temperatures &gt;120 C. This decomposition mechanism is key to how the zinc salts provide anti-wear and anti-oxidation performance enhancements in engine oils.\u00a0</p> <p>Photodegradation is not expected to cause significant physical degradation of dithiophosphate alkyl esters. Category members do not contain bonds that have a high potential to absorb UV light above 290 nm. These substances have low vapor pressure, which indicates that they have a low potential to partition into the air to a significant extent where they would be subject to indirect photodegradation.\u00a0</p> <p>These substances are not expected to partition to water or air if released into the environment due to their low water solubility and low vapor pressure. They are also hydrophobic in nature, which suggests that any which reaches the water compartment will be immobilized through binding to the organic component of soils and sediments.</p> <p>A Japanese MITI publication cited a bioaccumulation factor of less than 100 for a C4-5 ester zinc dithiophosphate indicating a low potential for bioconcentration or cumulative effects. .\u00a0</p> <p>The hydrocarbon portion of these compounds that is susceptible to biodegradation is present in both the zinc dialkyldithiophosphates and the dithiophosphate alkyl esters. Therefore, it is expected that the dithiophosphate alkyl esters will behave similarly. The zinc salts are poorly biodegradable.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The low water solubility suggests that the acute aquatic toxicity of these substances should be low due to limited bioavailability to aquatic organisms. However, the length of the alkyl side chains on these substances will influence their relative water solubility, and, hence, their relative toxicity. Diethyl dithiophosphate for example is highly toxic to Daphnids</p> <p>Zinc O,O-bis(isooctyl)dithiophosphate (CAS RN 28629-66-5) also appears to be harmful to aquatic organisms such as fish and Daphnids.</p> <p>Sulfide ion is very toxic to aquatic life, threshold concentration for fresh or saltwater fish is 0.5ppm. The product therefore is very toxic to aquatic life. The major decomposition product, hydrogen sulfide, is damaging to vegetation at 5ppm for 24 hours</p> <p>Studies on various thiophosphates indicated complete mineralization within three weeks by acclimation. A water stability study demonstrated the nature of hydrolysis involves the attack of water molecule on the phosphorus ester involving P-O bond fission. .</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">For hydrogen sulfide:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since hydrogen sulfide exists as a gas at atmospheric pressure,\r\npartitioning to the air is likely to occur after environmental releases.\r\nHowever, the compound is also soluble in oil and water, and therefore, may\r\npartition as well to surface water, groundwater, or moist soil. In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur.
