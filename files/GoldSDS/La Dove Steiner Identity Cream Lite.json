The short half-life is consistent with the presence of a reactive hydroxyl OH and|an aldehyde function.|Stability In Water|HMPCC is expected to be stable in aqueous solution given that it contains an unreactive tertiary|alcohol group and aldehyde that is not readily oxidisable in water.|Biodegradation|In a 20-day OECD closed bottle test, HMPCC showed measurable bio-oxidation (BOD/COD x I 00= 10%) after 20 days incubation with activated sludge. Because HMPCC showed limited solubility in the test medium, it was directly injected into the reaction vessel. According to the authors, the test was intended to screen substances of potential biodegradation. The MITI linear and non-linear model predictions indicate that HMPCC should be readily biodegraded [BIOWIN EPI Suite, 2000].|The structurally related substance, 7-hydroxycitronellal at an initial dose of 52.5 mg DOC/lI is completely biodegraded (99.8%) by day 19 in Method F biodegradability study in the Blue|Book. In another biodegradability test, using a modified Sturm procedure in an OECD 301 B Guideline, 7-hydroxycitronellal was 93.7% biodegraded after 28 days. Hydroxycitronellal is classified as readily and ultimately biodegradable. It is anticipated that HMPCC like 7-hydroxycitronellal will be readily and ultimately biodegradable.|Fugacity modelling predicts that HMPCC is distributed mainly to the soil (74.5%), but also is distributed to water (24.7%) and. to some extent, air (0.015%) and sediment (0.81 %).|Ecotoxicity:|In a semi-static test with guppies, the structural relative 3-cyclohexene- 1-carboxaldehyde exhibited a 14-day LC50 of 10.2 micromoles/L or 21.4 mg/L.The calculated LC50 values for HMPCC are on the same order of magnitude. The calculated 96-hour LC50 for HMPCC was reported to be 6.8 mg/L (aldehydes) and the 14-day LC50 was reported to be 20. mg/L [ECOSAR EPI Suite, 20001].|Daphnia LC50 (48 h): 76 mg/L (EPA Method 40GTW23); 1.773 mg/L [calculated: ECOSAR EPI Suite 2000]|Green algae EC50 (96 h): 7.019 [calculated, ECOSAR EPI Suite 2000]",

Structurally, 3 of the 4 substances in this category are\u00a0<i>alpha,beta</i>-unsaturated aldehydes. These substances have an oxidisable aldehyde function and an allylic position (C4) labile to attack by hydroxy radical species in the gas phase. The known chemical reactivity of these substrates supports short photodegradation half-lives predicted by the model.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>No hydrolysis is possible for any of these 4 cinnamaldehyde derivatives. All four are expected to be relatively stable in aqueous solution, although they may be slowly oxidized to the corresponding cinnamic acid derivative in aqueous media.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Studies for\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde demonstrate these materials to be readily biodegradable. Biodegradation of\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde was 70.5% and 90% after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B and 301F, respectively. Similarly,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde was 76.5% and 97% biodegraded after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B \u00a0and 301F, respectively and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde was 84% and 96% biodegraded after 28 days using test OECD guideline 301F. The three cinnamyl derivatives met the 10 day window criteria for biodegradability. Although no biodegradation study is available for cinnamaldehyde, this substance, like the other three cinnamaldehyde derivatives contains an oxidisable aldehyde function.</p> <p><b>Fugacity:</b>\u00a0Transport and distribution in the environmental were modeled using Level 1 Fugacity based Environmental Equilibrium Partitioning Model Version 2.11: Based on the comparable physiochemical properties of the four aldehydes, it is not unexpected that the four would exhibit similar distribution in the environment. The significance of these calculations must be evaluated in the context that the substances in this chemical category are readily oxidized in the environment to corresponding carboxylic acids. The aldehydes have been shown to be readily and/or ultimately biodegradable, and the remainder would be expected to behave similarly in the environment.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The 96-hour calculated LC50 for cinnamaldehyde is calculated to be 11.9 mg/L while the alkyl substituted homologues\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, being more lipophilic, are calculated to have LC50 values about one third of that for cinnamaldehyde (3.14 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The remaining substance\u00a0<i>p-t-butyl-alpha-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde\u00a0</i>possessing the same molecular weight as\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and is also an alkyl substituted cinnamaldehyde is calculated to have approximately the same LC50 (LD50=3.19 mg/L).</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): cinnamaldehyde 81. mg/L (calculated).</p> <p>The Daphnia 48-hour LC50s for the more lipophilic substances\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>hexylcinnamaldehyde are calculated to be 0.416 and 0.224 mg/L, respectively. The calculated LC50 for\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde is in the same range, 0.403 mg/L.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|Biodegradation: 9%|TOC 32%",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>IFRA Restricted Fragrance Substance</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) Standards form the\r\nbasis for the globally accepted and recognized risk management system for the\r\nsafe use of fragrance ingredients and are part of the IFRA Code of Practice.\r\nThis is the self-regulating system of the industry, based on risk assessments\r\ncarried out by an independent Expert Panel.</span></p> #The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) believe that BMHCA is not safe for use as fragrance ingredient in cosmetic leave-on and rinse-off type products, neither at concentration limits according to the ones set up by IFRA in 2013 (MoS = 3.6) nor at concentration limits as set up by IFRA in the revised proposal that has been submitted in 2015 belatedly (MoS = 53).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Within each group, the\r\nmonoterpenoids may be simple unsaturated hydrocarbons or may have functional\r\ngroups and be alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. Common aliphatic examples\r\ninclude myrcene, citral, geraniol, lavandulol, and linalool. The important\r\nrepresentatives of monocyclic monoterpenoids are alpha-terpineol, limonene,\r\nthymol, menthol, carvone, eucalyptol, and perillaldehyde. The bicyclic\r\nmonoterpenes may be divided into three classes according to the size of the\r\nsecond ring. The first being a six-membered ring in each class while the second\r\ncan be either a three, four, or five-membered ring.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Antioxidants can in most cases minimise the oxidation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fragrance terpenes are generally easily oxidised in air. \u00a0Non-oxidised limonene, linalool and caryophyllene turned out to be very weak sensitizers, however after oxidation limonene hydroperoxide and linalool hydroperoxide are strong sensitizers. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time.

It is a naturally occurring component together with linalyl esters in a variety of fruits, fruit peels, fruit juices, vegetables and spices as for example laurel, coriander seeds and clary sage. The annual worldwide use of linalool and linalyl acetate in fragrances exceeds 1000 metric tons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0For consideration of potential sensitization the exposure is calculated as a percent concentration used on the skin. Exposure to linalool used in fine fragrance products is reported as 4.3% based on the use of 20% of the fragrance mixture in the fine fragrance consumer product.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Experimental studies in laboratory animals combined with advanced chemical analyses have shown that linalool is easily oxidized, and that the content of linalool decreased to about 80% after oxidation for 10 weeks at standardized conditions. One of the major oxidation products was identified as 7-hydroperoxy-3,7-dimethyl-octal-1,5-diene-3-ol. In guinea pig sensitisation studies a sample of oxidized linalool was a significant allergen sensitizing 8 of 15 test animals, whereas controls were negative. Linalyl hydroperoxide is a very strong sensitiser at the 1% level. Further studies have documented the sensitising capacity of linalool and derivatives \u00a0found commercially available grade of linalool (97% purity) to be a weak sensitiser. When impurities were identified and removed the sensitising capacity was reduced but not eliminated. During storage, linalool undergoes autoxidation, building up products including hydroperoxides such as 7-hydroperoxy-3,7-dimethyl-octal-1,5-diene-3-ol , which has been identified as the apparent cause allergic reactions on exposed skin. Animal testing data found that with guinea pigs, ten week old samples of linalool sensitized the animals skin, but highly purified linalool produces no reaction.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

Acetylated myrcene can be expected to be in the same range since the calculated half-life for its principal constituents, neryl acetate and geranyl acetate, is 19 minutes and for the second major constituent, limen, is 37 minutes. Structurally, these substances are unsaturated primary alcohols that have the potential to form radical species in the gas phase and also be oxidized to the corresponding unsaturated aldehyde. The known chemical reactivity of these substrates supports short photodegradation half-lives predicted by the model.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:</b>\u00a0No hydrolysis is possible for the three terpenoid primary alcohols, citronellol, geraniol and nerol. All three are expected to be very stable in aqueous solution. The principal constituents of acetylated myrcene, geranyl acetate and neryl acetate are esters and are calculated to have half-lives for hydrolysis of 23 days at pH 8 and 231 days at pH 7. Hydrolysis of geranyl acetate and neryl acetate is expected both\u00a0<i>in\u00a0</i>vivo and in the environment. The second major constituent of acetylated myrcene, limen, will not hydrolyse in water. The significance of calculated half-life data for geranyl acetate must take into account the experimental data that aliphatic ester, in general, are readily hydrolysed in fish.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Duplicate studies on citronellol and geraniol show these materials to be readily biodegradable (<i>i.e.,\u00a0</i>100% biodegradation [OECD 301B, OECD 301C]. Likewise, a mixture of geranial and neral (citral) exhibits greater than 92% \u00a0and 99.5% biodegradation. Nerol is a stereoisomer of geraniol and would likewise be expected to be readily biodegradable. Geranyl acetate has also been shown to be readily biodegradable (greater than 82% biodegradation) and, therefore, neryl acetate would be as well. The other significant constituent of acetylated myrcene, limen, has not been shown to be readily biodegradable. However, since limen makes up only 10% of the mixture, a ready biodegradation test of the mixture is expected to result in apparent ready biodegradation.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones.

At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>Terpenes and their oxygen-containing counterparts, the terpenoids, produce a variety of physiological effects. Pine oil monoterpenes, for example, produce a haemorrhagic gastritis characterised by stomach pain and bleeding and vomiting. \u00a0Systemic effects of pine oils include weakness and central nervous depression, excitement, loss of balance, headache, with hypothermia and respiratory failure.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>|Vomiting, shock, cyanosis and convulsions preceded death in a child who consumed an unknown quantity of a preparation consisting mainly of &quot;oil of citronella&quot;. Gastric mucosa was found to be severely damaged. By stomach tube citronellol produced paralysis, coma, death in doses of|about 1-4 ml/kg in rabbits.",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>In the presence of air, a number of common flavour and fragrance chemicals can form peroxides surprisingly fast. Antioxidants can in most cases minimise the oxidation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fragrance terpenes are generally easily oxidised in air. \u00a0Non-oxidised limonene, linalool and caryophyllene turned out to be very weak sensitizers, however after oxidation limonene hydroperoxide and linalool hydroperoxide are strong sensitizers. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time. Autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes greatly to fragrance allergy, which emphasizes the need of testing with compounds that patients are actually exposed to and not only with the ingredients originally applied in commercial formulations.</p> <p>Peroxidisable terpenes and terpenoids should only be used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level, for instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production. Such products should have a peroxide value of less than 10 millimoles peroxide per liter. This requirement is based on the published literature mentioning sensitising properties when containing peroxides.</p>",

The\r\npredicted or measured water solubilities of these olefins range from 50 mg/L at\r\n20 C for hexene to 0.00015 mg/L at 25 C for 1-octadecene, and to 6.33 [E-23]\r\nmg/L at 25 C for C54 alpha olefin, which suggests there is a lower potential\r\nfor the larger olefins to be bioavailable to aquatic organisms due to their low\r\nsolubilities. Their vapor pressures range from 230.6 hPa at 25 C for hexene to\r\n0.00009 hPa at 25 C for 1-octadecene, and to 1.13 [E-16] hPa at 25 C for C54\r\nalpha olefin, which suggests the shorter chain olefins will tend to partition\r\nto the air at a significant rate and not remain in the other environmental\r\ncompartments for long periods of time; while the longer chain olefins will tend\r\nto partition primarily to water, soil or sediment, depending on water\r\nsolubility and sorption behavior. The predicted soil adsorption coefficients\r\n(Koc) range from 149 for C6 to 230,800 for C18 and to 1.0 [E10] for C54,\r\nindicating increasing partitioning to soil/sediment with increasing carbon\r\nnumber. Level I fugacity modelling predicts that the C6-13 olefins would\r\npartition primarily to air, while the C16 and longer chain olefins would\r\npartition primarily to soil. Results of Level III fugacity modelling suggest\r\nthat the C6 -8 olefins will partition primarily to the water compartment; and,\r\nas the chain length increases beyond C10, soil and sediment become the primary\r\ncompartments. These chemicals have a very low potential to hydrolyse and do not\r\nphotodegrade directly. However, in the air, all members of the category are\r\nsubject to atmospheric oxidation from hydroxyl radical attack, with calculated\r\ndegradation half- lives of 1.8 to 4.8 hours. C6 -30 olefins have been shown to\r\ndegrade to an extent of approximately 8-92% in standard 28 day biodegradation\r\ntests. These results were not clearly correlated with carbon number or any\r\nother identifiable parameter; however, the weight of evidence shows that the\r\nmembers of the higher olefins have potential for degradation in the\r\nenvironment. Volatilisation from water is predicted to occur rapidly (hours to\r\ndays), with Henry\u2019s Law Constants (bond method) ranging from 0.423 (C6) to 10.7\r\n(C18), and to 2.89 [E5] (C54) atm- m3/mol. Consideration of these degradation\r\nprocesses supports the assessment that these substances will degrade relatively\r\nrapidly in the environment and not persist. Based on calculated\r\nbioconcentration factors, the C6, C7, and C16 and longer chain length category\r\nmembers are not expected to bioaccumulate (BCF: C6 = 44-46, C7 = 236, C16 =\r\n71-92 and &gt;= C18 = 3.2-4.6). Although the C8 - 15 olefins have BCFs ranging\r\nfrom 313 to 2030, and Kow values ranging from 4.13 to 7.49, and thus are\r\nconsidered to have the potential for bioaccumulation, their physico-chemical\r\nproperties and fate indicate that there would be limited environmental exposure\r\nbecause of volatility, biodegradability and limited solubility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Data indicate that acute aquatic toxicity can be observed for C6\r\nthrough the C10 olefins (C6: EC/LC50 range of 1-10 mg/L; C7-C10: EC/LC50 range\r\nof 0.1-1.0 mg/L), and that toxicity increases with increasing carbon number\r\nwithin that range, which is consistent with increasing Kow values (3.07 -5.12).\r\nAbove a chain length of 10, toxicity is not observed within the limits of\r\nsolubility.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented.

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Certain substances, commonly found in perfumes or perfumed products, produce hypersensitivity. Sensitising constituents have been classified as Class A (common sensitisers) or Class B (rare sensitisers) in a Japanese study (Nakayama 1998). \u00a0Contact allergy to perfumes occurs with a relatively high incidence, such incidence only surpassed by nickel allergy in the community. In a Danish study, it was found that about 1.1% of the population was allergic to Peru balsam or \"fragrance mix\".</p> <p>There is no cure for perfume allergy. Once sensitised, exposure to even minute amounts of the perfume, gives rise to eruptions and eczema. These symptoms may be treated with steroid creams, although frequent recourse to this treatment produces unwanted side-effects.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Orally administered ionones and structurally related substances\r\nare absorbed and metabolized in mammals by allylic hydroxylation of the ring\r\nfollowed by oxidation of the hydroxyl group to 3-oxo derivatives. Reduction of\r\nthe ketone function to the corresponding secondary alcohol also occurs.\r\nCombinations of these detoxication reactions result in the formation of\r\nmultiple polar metabolites, which are excreted in the urine unchanged or\r\nconjugated with glucuronic acid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The metabolism of ionones is expected to be similar in humans.\r\nThis is supported by human metabolism studies of retinoids and carotenoids such\r\nas <i>cis</i>-13-retinoic acid (i.e., isotretinoin) and <i>beta</i>-carotene,\r\nrespectively, which possess ionone fragments. The primary blood and biliary\r\nmetabolites following oral administration of isotretinoin to humans include the\r\nglucuronic acid conjugates of isotretinoin and the allylic oxidation product.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Rat oral LD50 values available for <i>alpha</i>-ionone, <i>alpha</i>-<i>iso</i>-methylionone,\r\nmethylionone (mixture of isomers), and <i>gamma-</i>ionone indicate these materials\r\nto be very low in oral acute toxicity. The LD50 values of all four substances\r\nare greater than 5000 mg/kg bw. Mouse oral LD50 values are also greater than\r\n5000 mg/kg bw for <i>alpha</i>-ionone, <i>alpha</i>-<i>iso</i>-methylionone,\r\nand methyl ionone (mixture of isomers). The mouse oral LD50s are reported to be\r\n6650 mg/kg bw for <i>alpha</i>-ionone, 5331 mg/kg bw for methylionone, and 8714\r\nfor <i>alpha</i>-isomethylionone. The acute dermal LD50s reported for <i>alpha-iso</i>-methylionone,\r\nmethylionone (mixture of isomers), and <i>gamma-</i>ionone are all greater than\r\n5000 mg/kg bw.\u00a0 Based on these results the acute oral and dermal toxicities of\r\nionone derivatives is concluded to be very low.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on the results of dietary studies with <i>alpha</i>-<i>iso</i>-methylionone,\r\n<i>alpha</i>-ionone, and <i>beta</i>-ionone and a dermal study with <i>gamma-</i>methylionone,\r\nit is concluded that none of the ionone derivatives exhibits any evidence of\r\ntoxicity at dose levels up to and including 10 mg/kg bw/day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The lack of reproductive toxicity is supported by observations\r\nmade in three separate repeat dose studies in which there was no evidence\r\n(organ weight, gross or histopathological) toxicity to reproductive organs\r\n(testis, seminal vesicles, ovaries) of rats maintained on diets of up to 100\r\nmg/kg bw/day for 90 days. Therefore, it is concluded that none of the ionone\r\nderivatives discussed show any evidence of reproductive toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Vitamin A (retinoid) produces teratogenicity; ionones may cleave\r\nfrom retinoids after oxidation. Studies of ionones indicate they are not\r\nteratogenic. The results of studies on numerous compounds indicate that\r\nteratogenic potential is associated with specific structural features in the\r\nVitamin A which is not shared with ionones</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on the results of this <i>in vivo </i>genotoxicity assays\r\nand the lack of any evidence of genotoxicity for numerous <i>in vitro </i>assays\r\nwith and without metabolic activation, it is unlikely that any of these\r\nmaterials would exhibit a significant genotoxic potential <i>in vivo</i>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The ionones (isoprenoids, terpenoids) fall into two major groups \u2013\r\nionones and rose ketones, Both groups are based on cyclohexene derivatives\r\ncarrying a butenone side chain. The structure can have cis\u2013trans-isomers around\r\nthe double bond.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Rose ketones have been defined as fragrance ingredients with the\r\ngeneral formula, \u2018\u20181-(trimethylcyclohexenyl/hexadienyl)-2-buten-1-one\u2019\u2019. There\r\nare numerous possible isomers with this general formula. The cyclohexenyl\r\nderivatives are called damascones, and the cyclohexadienyl derivatives are\r\ncalled damascenones.All of the materials contain the 2-buten-1-one structure</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ionone and damascone can be regarded as being archetypal for the\r\ngroup as a whole. The only structural differences between the ionones and the\r\nrose ketones are the position of the allylic double bond and of the ketone in\r\nthe butanone side chain</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\"Irones\" are formed by addition of a methyl group to the\r\ncyclohexene ring. \"Methyl -ionones \"are formed by addition of a\r\nmethyl group to the butenone side chain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The olfactory differences between ionones, irones and\r\nmethyl-ionones are dramatic considering the tiny change in their structure.\r\nAlpha-Ionone gives off a woody violet quality with a bit of raspberry to it.\r\nAlpha-Irone is the smell of iris. Alpha-methyl Ionone is softer and imparts the\r\npowdery quality to iris.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The position of the double bond(s) in the cyclohexenyl moiety also\r\nsignificantly influences other olfactory difference resulting in so-called beta\r\nand gamma ionones and the analogous irones and methyl ionones.</span></p> <p>Intolerance to perfumes, by inhalation, may occur if the perfume contains a sensitising principal. Symptoms may vary from general illness, coughing, phlegm, wheezing, chest-tightness, headache, exertional dyspnoea, acute respiratory illness, hayfever, and other respiratory diseases (including asthma). Perfumes can induce hyper-reactivity of the respiratory tract without producing an IgE-mediated allergy or demonstrable respiratory obstruction. This was shown by placebo-controlled challenges of nine patients to \"perfume mix\". The same patients were also subject to perfume provocation, with or without a carbon filter mask, to ascertain whether breathing through a filter with active carbon would prevent symptoms. The patients breathed through the mouth, during the provocations, as a nose clamp was used to prevent nasal inhalation. The patient's earlier symptoms were verified; breathing through the carbon filter had no protective effect. The symptoms were not transmitted via the olfactory nerve but they may have been induced by trigeminal reflex via the respiratory tract or by the eyes.</p> <p>Cases of occupational asthma induced by perfume substances such as isoamyl acetate, limonene, cinnamaldehyde and benzaldehyde, tend to give persistent symptoms even though the exposure is below occupational exposure limits.</p> <p>Inhalation intolerance has also been produced in animals. The emissions of five fragrance products, for one hour, produced various combinations of sensory irritation, pulmonary irritation, decreases in expiratory airflow velocity as well as alterations of the functional observational battery indicative of neurotoxicity in mice. Neurotoxicity was found to be more severe after mice were repeatedly exposed to the fragrance products, being four brands of cologne and one brand of toilet water.</p>",

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
