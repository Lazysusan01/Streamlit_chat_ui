Patients with inadequate tidal volumes or poor arterial blood gases (pO2 50 mm Hg) should be intubated.\u00a0</li> <li>Arrhythmias complicate some hydrocarbon ingestion and/or inhalation and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial injury has been reported; intravenous lines and cardiac monitors should be established in obviously symptomatic patients. The lungs excrete inhaled solvents, so that hyperventilation improves clearance.\u00a0</li> <li>A chest x-ray should be taken immediately after stabilisation of breathing and circulation to document aspiration and detect the presence of pneumothorax.\u00a0</li> <li>Epinephrine (adrenalin) is not recommended for treatment of bronchospasm because of potential myocardial sensitisation to catecholamines. Inhaled cardioselective bronchodilators (e.g. Alupent, Salbutamol) are the preferred agents, with aminophylline a second choice.\u00a0</li> <li>Lavage is indicated in patients who require decontamination; ensure use of cuffed endotracheal tube in adult patients.

Therefore emesis should not be induced mechanically or pharmacologically. Mechanical means should be used if it is considered necessary to evacuate the stomach contents; these include gastric lavage after endotracheal intubation.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>A significant number of individuals exposed to mixed trimethylbenzenes complained of nervousness, tension, anxiety and asthmatic bronchitis.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments The liquid may produce considerable gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful or toxic if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

A BCF of 1,000 was reported for both aquatic plants and\r\nfish, and a value of 10,000 was reported for aquatic invertebrates. The order\r\nof enrichment of zinc in different aquatic organisms was as follows (zinc\r\nconcentrations in \u00b5g/g dry weight appear in parentheses): fish (25), shrimp\r\n(50), mussel (60), periphyton (260), zooplankton (330), and oyster (3,300). The\r\nhigh enrichment in oysters may be due to their ingestion of particulate matter\r\ncontaining higher concentrations of zinc than ambient water. Other\r\ninvestigators have also indicated that organisms associated with sediments have\r\nhigher zinc concentrations than organisms living in the aqueous layer. With\r\nrespect to bioconcentration from soil by terrestrial plants, invertebrates, and\r\nmammals, BCFs of 0.4, 8, and 0.6, respectively, have been reported. The\r\nconcentration of zinc in plants depends on the plant species, soil pH, and the\r\ncomposition of the soil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Plant species do not concentrate zinc above the levels present in\r\nsoil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>In some fish, it has been observed that the level of zinc found in\r\ntheir bodies did not directly relate to the exposure concentrations.

Leaching and lateral movement in the soil may take place because of water-solubility. Some photodegradation may occur.\u00a0</p> <p>Factors that influence biodegradation in soil include volatility, soil type, soil moisture, adsorption, pH, temperature, and photodegradation, all of which make it unlikely that long-term contamination of the soil will occur. In plants thiocarbamates are rapidly metabolised in typical oxidation reaction, e.g., thiol sulfoxidation to the corresponding sulfoxides, reactive intermediates that are capable of reacting with sulfhydryl groups to form conjugates. On hydrolysis mercaptans, carbon dioxide and alkylamines may be formed. Soil microorganisms also contribute significantly to the disappearance of thiocarbamates from the soil. In microorganisms and plants thiocarbamates undergo hydrolysis followed by transthiolation and sulfoxidation to form carbon dioxide and compounds that enter the metabolic pool. From limited evidence it appears that thiocarbamates and breakdown products can affect the enzyme activities, respiration and nitrification of soil microorganisms at dose levels of the order of 10 mg/kg dry soil or more.\u00a0</p> <p>Absorption of light causes the breakage of the carbonyl C-S bond producing two radicals. These can combine with protons from the solvent giving the formamide and mercaptan. The formamide is further degraded by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) to the dialkylamine by the elimination of carbon monoxide. Collision of two mercaptan radicals would lead to the formation of a disulfide. Because the sulfur-sulfur bond is quite susceptible to photolysis, continued exposure to UVR would result in a return to separate mercaptan radicals, and the possible reformation of the disulfide. Changes in the availability of protons could influence the concentrations of mercaptan and disulfide formed.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:\u00a0</b>The acute toxicity of thiocarbamates for fish is of the order of 5-25 mg/l water. There seems to be little or no risk for birds or honeybees.</p> <p>for dithiocarbamates:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Dithiocarbamates with hydrophilic groups form water-soluble, heavy-metal complexes, while some of the dithiocarbamate metal complexes used as fungicides are insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents. Alkylene bisdithiocarbamates (containing two donor CS2 groups), which form polymeric chelates, are insoluble in both water and non-polar solvents</p> <p>Information on the environmental impact of dithiocarbamates with respect to persistence and bioaccumulation in different species and food chains is limited. Available information suggests that these compounds are degraded in the presence of moisture, oxygen, etc. to form a number of compounds, some of which are toxicologically important.</p> <p>Soil organisms are capable of metabolising dithiocarbamates; breakdown products appear to affect enzyme activities, respiration and nitrification at dose levels of the order of 10 mg/kg dry soil or more.</p> <p>Dithiocarbamates produce an isothiocyanate radical (-N=C=S) in fungi and other microorganisms; this inactivates SH groups in amino acids contained within individual cells, thus producing biocidal activity.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Generally dithiocarbamates have an LC50 of less than 1 mg/l for invertebrates (Daphnia) and between 1 and 4 mg/l for algae (Chlorella). The acute toxicity in fish is higher. The sac fry and early fry stages of rainbow trout have a higher sensitivity than other early life stages and embryotoxic and teratogenic effects have been induced by certain dithiocarbamates. Bioaccumulation, however, is low (bioconcentration factor &lt;100). Several dithiocarbamates have been shown to affect testicular development and function and to cause nerve fibre degeneration in domestic fowl.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Although thiocarbamates are not particularly effective cholinesterase inhibitors they appear to be direct acting neurotoxic agents.

Ethylene(bis)dithiocarbamates are metabolically converted in animals to ethylene thiourea (ETU), a known carcinogen, teratogen and antithyroid agent. The principal systemic effects in animals after subchronic or chronic exposure to ETU include depression of body weight gains, antithyroid effects, changes in the liver, and increased serum cholesterol secondary to the antithyroid effect. The mechanism by which thioureas exert the latter effect involves the inhibition of iodine uptake and activation by the thyroid. At low doses, a physiological and biological compensation mechanism maintains normal levels of circulating thyroid hormone. Prolonged exposure to high doses of thyroid inhibitors causes severe hypertrophy and hyperplasia resulting in reduced levels of circulating thyroid hormone. Rats given 0.25% maneb or zineb (the zinc equivalent) in the diet for 2 years developed thyroid hyperplasia and nodular goiter. Acute non-specific decreases in immunological reactivity have also been recorded in rats. Dogs given daily doses of maneb - manganese ethylene(bis)dithiocarbamate - (200 mg/kg for several months) developed neurological disease (tremors, weakness, gastrointestinal disturbance, posterior incoordination, hypotonus and paresis progressing to flaccid paraplegia). This may result from the release of carbon disulfide from dithiocarbamates in the acid environment of the stomach. Dithiocarbamates produce an isothiocyanate radical (-N=C=S) in fungi and other microorganisms; this inactivates SH groups in amino acids contained within individual cells, thus producing biocidal activity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Some thiocarbamates have an effect on sperm morphology and therefore reproduction.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

They are widely used in sealants, gasket\r\nmaterials, hot melt adhesives, rubber bands, toy products, shoe soles and in\r\nbitumen products for road paving and roofing applications. They are also used\r\nas impact modifiers and tougheners in plastics and adhesives. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">They are produced by ionic copolymerization of styrene and\r\nbutadiene (SBS) or of styrene and 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (SIS).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SIBS copolymers, may however, also contain an unsaturated\r\nelastomer, or rubber unit, consisting of isoprene and 1,3-butadiene.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) block copolymers, like other\r\nstyrene block copolymers, consist of block segments of styrene monomer and\r\nrubber monomer units. These materials have good abrasion resistance and good\r\naging stability when protected by additive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These polymers are often blended with many other polymers, and\r\nwith oil and fillers, which allows for a versatile modification of product\r\nproperties. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">When cooled from the melt state to a temperature below the glass\r\ntransition, the polystyrene blocks phase separate to form rigid and hard\r\ndomains that act as physical cross-links for the elastomeric diene blocks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The most important tri-block copolymer is SBS. It has higher\r\ntensile strength than SBR rubber but only limited heat resistance. SBS and SIS\r\nare less resilient than chemically crosslinked elastomers and thus, do not\r\nrecover as efficiently from deformation as vulcanized diene elastomers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Because of the presence of double bonds in the midblock structure,\r\nboth SBS and SIS are vulnerable to thermal and oxidative degradation. For\r\npolybutadiene, degradation generally occurs through crosslinking, and for\r\npolyisoprene through chain scission. By selective hydrogenation of the midblock\r\nto ethylene-butylene (EB) repeat units the triblock copolymers become\r\nsubstantially more stable. These so called SEBS block copolymers have much\r\nimproved thermal and weathering resistance but less good mechanical properties.\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There is an important difference in the mechanism of degradation\r\nbetween styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymers and\r\nstyrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block copolymers. SBS polymers can degrade by\r\ncrosslinking in the mid-block. A formulation containing a high concentration of\r\nan SBS polymer, and held at high temperature in a mixer or holding tank for an\r\nexcessive period of time, may form gel particles as degradation occurs and\r\ngenerally increases in viscosity. SIS polymers degrade by chain scission of the\r\npolyisoprene chain. A formulation based on an SIS polymer degraded at high\r\ntemperature will show a loss in melt viscosity, but no gel will form.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Formulators often choose to blend SIS and SBS with SB polymers for\r\nimproved economics. However, SIS polymers have limited compatibility with SBS\r\nand SB polymers in many formulations. SIBS polymers offer improved\r\ncompatibility with SBS and SB polymers over conventional SIS polymers. This\r\nadditional level of compatibility can help improve adhesive formulation\r\nperformance</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">It is important to note that the unique polymerization process\r\nused to manufacture these polymers can yield both linear and radial polymer\r\nstructures useful for tailoring polymers to specific performance requirements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since SIBS polymers are styrenic block copolymers, tackifying\r\nresins and other additives have an affinity for either of the two phases with\r\nwhich to interact. SIBS polymers have two glass-transition temperatures - an\r\nupper (about 100 deg C for the polystyrene domains) and a lower (about -73 deg\r\nC for the isoprene-butadiene mid-block). SIBS polymers can be effectively\r\ntackified using resins from any of the major resin categories, such as aromatic\r\nmodified C5 hydrocarbons, partially and fully hydrogenated hydrocarbons, rosin\r\nesters (gum, wood, and tall oil derivatives), and modified\u00a0 terpenes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Because of their unique isoprene/butadiene mid-block chemistry,\r\nadhesives formulated with SIBS polymers are less subject to viscosity change\r\nduring prolonged heat conditions. SIBS polymers can be mixed similar to\r\nconventional mid-block polymers, and the same level of care and good\r\nmanufacturing practices should be followed. SIBS polymers show excellent\r\nviscosity retention during heat aging.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Styrene-butadiene or\r\nstyrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) describe families of synthetic rubbers derived\r\nfrom styrene and butadiene. These materials have good abrasion resistance and\r\ngood aging stability when protected by additives.\u00a0 About 50% of car tires are\r\nmade from various types of SBR. The styrene/butadiene ratio influences the\r\nproperties of the polymer: with high styrene content, the rubbers are harder\r\nand less rubbery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Other uses include shoe heels and\r\nsoles, gaskets, and even chewing gum.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Latex (emulsion) SBR is\r\nextensively used in coated papers, being one of the cheapest resins to bind\r\npigmented coatings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">It is also used in building\r\napplications, as a sealing and binding agent behind renders as an alternative\r\nto PVA, but is more expensive. In the latter application, it offers better\r\ndurability, reduced shrinkage and increased flexibility, as well as being\r\nresistant to emulsification in damp conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SBR is often used as part of\r\ncement based substructural (basement) waterproofing systems where as a liquid\r\nit is mixed with water to form the Gauging solution for mixing the powdered\r\nTanking material to a slurry. SBR aids the bond strength, reduces the potential\r\nfor shrinkage and adds an element of flexibility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">It is also used by speaker driver\r\nmanufacturers as the material for Low Damping Rubber Surrounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Additionally, it is used in some\r\nrubber cutting boards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SBR is also used as a binder in\r\nlithium-ion battery electrodes, in combination with carboxymethyl cellulose as\r\na water-based alternative for, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SBR is not to be confused with a\r\nthermoplastic elastomer made from the same monomers, styrene-butadiene block\r\ncopolymer</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene),\r\nor SBS, is a hard rubber that is used for products like the soles of shoes,\r\ntire treads, and other places where durability is important. It is a type of\r\ncopolymer called a block copolymer. Its backbone chain is made up of three\r\nsegments. The first is a long chain of polystyrene. The middle is a long chain\r\nof polybutadiene, and the last segment is another long section of polystyrene </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The polybutadiene and polystyrene\r\nportions are incompatible and form a two-phase system consisting of domains of\r\nglassy polystyrene interlinked by flexible polybutadiene chains. The resulting\r\nnetwork structure behaves as if the molecules were chemically cross-linked or\r\nvulcanized and exhibits high tensile strength. The tensile strength of the\r\nbutadiene-styrene block copolymer depends on the styrene content, molecular\r\nweight, and temperature.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bitumens may be modified by SBSs\r\nDuring the dissolution of the rubber, the following phenomena occur: polymer\r\ncrumbs, molten at high temperature, are sheared into small droplets and the\r\nmolecules start to uncoil and disentangle, assisted by the oils and resins in\r\nthe bitumen. Depending on the concentration of rubber, a continuous bitumen or\r\na continuous rubber phase will develop.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Other systems may be used in\r\nbitumen modification; these include SB (styrene-butadiene), SIS\r\n(styrene-isoprene-styrene), and SIBS (styrene-isoprene-butadiene-styrene),\r\neither alone or in admixture with SBS.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>A thermoplastic, or thermosoftening\r\nplastic, is a plastic material, a polymer, that becomes pliable or moldable\r\nabove a specific temperature and solidifies upon cooling.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Most thermoplastics have a high\r\nmolecular weight.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.
