In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle. Sodium sulfate is not reactive in aqueous solution at room temperature. Sodium sulfate will completely dissolve, ionise and distribute across the entire planetary \"aquasphere\".

Sodium and sulfate ions are essential to all living organisms and their intracellular and extracellular concentrations are actively regulated.

For invertebrates\u00a0<i>(Daphnia magna)\u00a0</i>the EC50 48 h = 4,580 mg/l and fish appeared to be the least sensitive with a LC50 96h = 7,960 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>. Activated sludge showed a very low sensitivity to sodium sulfate. There was no effect up to 8 g/l. Sodium sulfate is not very toxic to terrestrial plants.\u00a0<i>Picea banksiana\u00a0</i>was the most sensitive species, an effect was seen at 1.4 g/l. Sediment dwelling organisms were not very sensitive either, with an LC50 96h = 660 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Trycorythus sp</i>. Overall it can be concluded that sodium sulfate has no acute adverse effect on aquatic and sediment dwelling organisms. Toxicity to terrestrial plants is also low.</p> <p>No data were found for long term toxicity. The acute studies all show a toxicity of sodium sulfate higher than 100 mg/l, no bioaccumulation is expected,</p> <p>for inorganic sulfates:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Data from tap water studies with human volunteers indicate that sulfates produce a laxative effect at concentrations of 1000 - 1200 mg/litre, but no increase in diarrhoea, dehydration or weight loss. The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable taste; the lowest taste threshold concentration for sulfate is approximately 250 mg/litre as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems. No health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/litre.</p> <p>Sulfates are removed from the air by both dry and wet deposition processes. Wet deposition processes including rain-out (a process that occurs within the clouds) and washout (removal by precipitation below the clouds) contribute to the removal of sulfate from the atmosphere.</p> <p>In soil, the inorganic sulfates can adsorb to soil particles or leach into surface water and groundwater. Sulfates can be taken up by plants and be incorporated into the parenchyma of the plant.</p> <p>Sulfate in water can also be reduced by sulfate bacteria (<i>Thiobacilli</i>) which use them as a source of energy.</p> <p>In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Blended with oil, it was an early form of soap. It softens water while removing oil and grease. Undiluted, natron was a cleanser for the teeth and an early mouthwash. The mineral was mixed into early antiseptics for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, was used for making leather and as a bleach for clothing.|The mineral was used in Egyptian mummification because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, when exposed to moisture the carbonate in natron increases pH (raises alkalinity), which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both the living and the dead. Natron was added to castor oil to make a smokeless fuel, which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.|Natron is an ingredient for making a distinct color called Egyptian blue. It was used along with sand and lime in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until 640 AD. The mineral was also employed as a flux to solder precious metals together.",

For this reason the effect of sodium carbonate on the organisms depends on the buffer capacity of the aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem.\u00a0</p> <p>Individual aquatic ecosystems are characterized by a specific pH and bicarbonate concentration and the organisms of the ecosystem are adapted to these specific natural conditions. Because the natural pH, bicarbonate and also the sodium concentration (and their fluctuations in time) varies significantly between aquatic ecosystems, it is not considered useful to derive a generic PNEC or PNECadded. To assess the potential environmental effect of a sodium carbonate discharge, the increase in sodium, bicarbonate and pH should be compared with the natural values and their fluctuations and based on this comparison it should be assessed if the anthropogenic addition is acceptable.</p> <p>The production and use of sodium carbonate could potentially result in an emission of sodium carbonate and it could locally increase the pH in the aquatic environment. However, the pH of effluents is normally measured very frequently and can be adapted easily and therefore a significant increase of the pH of the receiving water is not expected. If emissions of waste water are controlled by appropriate pH limits and/or dilutions in relation to the natural pH and buffering capacity of the receiving water, adverse effects on the aquatic environment are not expected due to production or use of sodium carbonate.</p> <p>The sodium ion will not adsorb to particulate matter, but remains in the aqueous phase. In water the carbonate ions will re-equilibrate until an equilibrium is established.</p> <p>The main equilibria are:</p> <p>HCO3- &lt;-&gt; CO3 (2+)-\u00a0+ H+ \u00a0 \u00a0 pKa = 10.35</p> <p>CO2\u00a0+ H2O &lt;-&gt; HCO3--\u00a0+ H+ \u00a0 \u00a0pKa = 6.33</p> <p>The carbonate will finally be incorporated into the inorganic and organic carbon cycle.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate EC50 (48 h): Cladoceran ceriodaphnia cf Dubia: 200-227 mg/l (immobilisation)</p> <p>The variation in acute toxicity for aquatic organisms may be explained for a significant extent by the variation in buffer capacity of the test medium. In general, mortality of the test organisms was found at concentrations higher than 100 mg/l but for Amphipoda, salmon and trout lethal effects were already observed at 67- 80 mg/l although these studies had a low reliability.</p> <p>Aquatic sodium emissions originating from uses of sodium carbonate are probably small compared to other sources. It is clear that an environmental hazard assessment of sodium should not only evaluate all natural and anthropogenic sources of sodium but should also evaluate all other ecotoxicity studies with sodium salts</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment. The growth of algae produces undesirable effects on the treatment of water for drinking purposes, on fisheries, and on the use of lakes for recreational purposes.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

These effects result following sequestration of blood calcium.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Ingestion of large amounts of phosphate salts (over 1 gm for an adult) may produce osmotic catharsis resulting in diarrhoea and probably, abdominal cramp. Large doses (4-8 gm) will almost certainly produce these effects in most individuals.

                "Environment": "<p>Metal-containing inorganic substances generally have negligible vapour pressure and are not expected to partition to air. Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Soluble silicates are wholly inorganic and once diluted have no significant environmental impact. They are saturated with respect to oxygen and as such do not possess a chemical oxygen demand (COD) or a biological oxygen demand (BOD). Depending on pH values soluble silicates in effluent and surface waters are rapidly dispersed and neutralised, by reaction with naturally occurring dissolved polyvalent metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, Al, Fe) forming insoluble silicates or amorphous silica. These products occur in abundance in natural soils and rocks. Dissolved silica resulting from commercial soluble silicates is also indistinguishable from naturally dissolved silica. The soluble silica input to the natural silica cycle from commercial use is furthermore inconsequential in view of the relative size and flux of the natural system. Concentrations of silica in natural waters commonly range from 1 to around 30 mg/l. Higher concentrations (up to 360 mg/l), however, have been found in some groundwaters where these high levels are related to rock type and water temperatures.</p> <p>\u00a0A study of the fate and possible effects of soluble silicates (waterglass) emissions to surface water has been performed by TNO (Apeldoorn NL, 2002). From the results of this study, no significant adverse effects to aquatic systems are to be assumed.</p> <p>Depending on pH values, reaction with naturally occurring dissolved polyvalent metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe, Al) will result in insoluble silicate or amorphous silica being formed. These products occur in abundance in natural soils and rocks. Dissolved silica resulting from commercial soluble silicates is also indistinguishable from naturally dissolved silica.</p> <p>Soluble silicates are totally insoluble in n-octanol (and most other organic solvents). The oil/water partition coefficient of these substances is therefore not applicable. Soluble silicates have no potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p>Untreated soluble silicate solutions are generally alkaline (pH values &gt; 9) and therefore neutralisation should be carried out before discharging to water/ effluent systems. Once neutralised, no adverse effects on aquatic biosystems are known.</p> <p>Microbial methylation plays important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of the \u00a0metalloids and possibly in their detoxification. Many microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts) and animals are now known to biomethylate arsenic, forming both volatile (e.g., methylarsines) and nonvolatile (e.g., methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) compounds. \u00a0Antimony and bismuth, also undergo biomethylation to some extent. Trimethylstibine formation by microorganisms is now well established, but this process apparently does not occur in animals. Formation of trimethylbismuth by microorganisms has been reported in a few cases.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p>",

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The material produces mild skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Repeated exposure to synthetic amorphous silicas may produce skin dryness and cracking.</p> <p>\u00a0Available data confirm the absence of significant toxicity by oral and dermal routes of exposure.</p> <p>Numerous repeated-dose, subchronic and chronic inhalation toxicity studies have been conducted in a number of species, at airborne concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3. Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p>",

LAS are mainly used in laundry detergents and cleaning agents. LAS are\r\nfrequently used as the sodium salts as the sole surfactant in a formulation or\r\nin conjunction with other anionic, nonionic or cationic surfactants. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The chemicals in this group can\r\nhave an alkyl chain between 10 and 16 carbon atoms. The main commercial grade\r\nmaterial is typically limited to a range of 10-14 or 10-13 carbons with a\r\ndodecyl-component of 20-35 %. The carbon chain distribution of the chemicals\r\nwill vary depending on the method of production and the source of the precursor\r\nchemicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">T he chemicals in this group are\r\nexpected to have similar toxicity, which is primarily due to the alkylbenzene\r\nsulfonate anion. They share similar physico-chemical properties, including\r\ndensity and melting points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The solubility of the homologues\r\ndiffers based on the alkyl chain length, usually decreasing with increasing\r\nchain length.However, as the chemicals are also mixtures of positional isomers,\r\nchemicals with the same alkyl chain distribution (same average carbon number)\r\ncan have different properties depending on the 2-phenyl isomer content\r\n(consistent with 4-substitution as the major product with smaller amounts of\r\nthe 2-substitution) </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS consist of an alkyl chain\r\nattached to a benzene ring in the para position to the sulfonate group.\r\nSometimes toluene, xylene and naphthalene are used in place of benzene. The\r\nhomologue distribution in commercial products covers alkyl chain lengths from\r\nC10 to C13 with an average chain length of C11.6. LAS raw materials are derived\r\nfrom linear alkyl benzenes in which the ring is attached to a C-atom which is\r\nitself attached to two other C-atoms. The benzene ring may be attached to any\r\nof the C atoms from C2 to C6 but not to C1. Structures in which the benzene ring\r\nmay be attached to different C atoms are described as isomers. E.g., the\r\nstructure with a C12 alkyl chain and the benzene ring attached at the second\r\nalkyl carbon is designated as the C12-2-isomer and abbreviated C12-2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS can be represented\r\nstructurally as:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">H3C(CH3)xCH(C6H4S)3.Na+)CH2(CH2)yCH3\r\n- x+y=9</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Compared to traditional soaps\r\nbranched alkyl benzenesulfonates (BAS) offer superior tolerance to hard water\r\nand better foaming. However, the highly branched tail made it difficult to\r\nbiodegrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The term \"linear\"\r\nrefers to the starting alkenes rather than the final product. The alkylation of\r\nlinear alkenes, even 1- alkenes such as 1-dodecene gives several isomers of\r\nphenyldodecane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Under ideal conditions the\r\ncleaning power of BAS and LAS is very similar, however LAS performs slightly\r\nbetter in normal use conditions, due to it being less affected by hard water.\r\nWithin LAS itself the detergency of the various isomers are fairly similar,\r\nhowever their physical properties (Krafft point, foaming etc.) are noticeably\r\ndifferent\u00a0 In particular the Krafft point of the high 2-phenyl product remains\r\nbelow 0 deg C up to 25% LAS whereas the low 2-phenyl cloud point is 5 deg C.\r\nThis behavior is often exploited by producers to create either clear or cloudy\r\nproducts.</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>For linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acids (LABS) (and their salts):<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />LABS  are generally highly water soluble (miscible) and have a relatively low  Kow. The environmental fate data indicate that these chemicals are  highly susceptible to photo-and biodegradation.<br />LABS are strong acids  (pKa &lt;1) that are completely ionised in aqueous solutions. The  chemical species present in aqueous solutions at neutral (physiological)  pH is the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (the LAS ion) (C10-14 linear  alkyl benzene-SO3-), the identical species present in solutions of LAS,  where the counter ion (typically sodium, calcium or ammonium) will  disassociate to form the LAS anion. Thus, the physical-chemical,  environmental fate, ecotoxicity and toxicity properties of the LABS and  LAS would be expected to be similar. It should be noted that the LABS  are liquids and LAS is a solid at room temperature. However, in water  the difference between the LAB sulfonic acids and LAS disappears as  dissociation results in the same ion in solution. Therefore, parameters  such as Kow, water solubility and pH/pKa are appropriate to compare. The  octanol-water partition coefficients are around 2 (log Kow) for all of  the chemicals in this category <br />LABS are not expected to volatilise  significantly. Fugacity modeling predicts that most of these chemicals  will partition to the soil and water. Very little partitions to the air  or sediment. <br />Photodegradation is estimated (using EPI Suite  software) to be a significant mechanism for breakdown. Based on the  model estimates, the hydroxyl radical reaction half-lives ranged from  about 7 to 8.6 hours. Estimated data for LAS were similar. Furthermore,  measured data for LAS suggest even more rapid photodegradation, with 95%  of the material degraded within 20 minutes at 20 C in a laboratory  study. <br />Experimental data data indicates that LAS is stable in water. <br />LABS  are generally biodegradable. Measured biodegradation data indicate  substantial microbial degradation under aerobic conditions. For  dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid 69% of the material mineralised after 28  days. Biodegradation of the C10-16 derivatives and the LAS are also  rapid, with 93% or greater of the material degrading within 28 or 37  days. In addition, studies show that straight chain alkylbenzene  sulfonate materials readily degrade, with the shorter chain length  compounds degrading more rapidly\u00a0 Thus, the data indicate that these  chemicals are highly susceptible to degradation, both by photolytic and  microbial mechanisms <br />The initial step in the biodegradation of LABS  under aerobic conditions is an omega -oxidation of the terminal methyl  group of the alkyl chain to form a carboxylic acid. Further degradation  proceeds by a stepwise shortening of the alkyl chain by beta -oxidation  leaving a short-chain sulfophenyl carboxylic acid. In the presence of  molecular oxygen the aromatic ring structure hydrolyses to form a  dihydroxy-benzene structure which is opened before desulfonation of the  formed sulfonated dicarboxylic acid. The final degradation steps have  not been investigated in details but are likely to occur by general  bacterial metabolic routes involving a total mineralisation and  assimilation into biomass . Both the initial omega -oxidation and the  hydroxylation of the ring structure of LAS require molecular oxygen, and  they are not expected to take place under anoxic conditions.<br />The  BioConcentration Factor (BCF) tends to increase with increasing alkyl  chain length but also the position of the aryl sulfonate moiety was  important. A higher BCF was seen for linear alkyl benzenesulfonate  isomers with the aryl sulfonate attached. Available data indicate that  LABS have low to moderate bioaccumulation potential, with a  bioconcentration factor for dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid of 130. LAS  has bioconcentration factors that range from 22 to 87. <br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Numerous  studies have been performed to determine the effects of LABS towards  aquatic organisms. The aquatic effect concentrations that were observed  in these studies are highly variable. This variation is partly related  to the testing of different isomers and homologues, but it may also be  due to the specific test conditions and species. The length of the alkyl  chain is an important factor determining the aquatic toxicity. In  general, the homologues with the highest number of carbons in the alkyl  chain are more toxic than are those with shorter alkyl chains. Today,  commercial LABS have a homologue distribution between C10 and C13 with a  typical average alkyl chain length of C11.6. <br />The widest range in  the toxicity of LABS towards species belonging to the same group is  found for algae\u00a0 Approximately 90% of the data found in the literature  fall between 0.1 and 100 mg/l. Typical ranges of EC50 values are 1 to  100 mg/l for fresh water species and &lt; 1 to 10 mg/l for marine  species. Typical values lie between 29 and 170 mg/l <br />A very low EC100  value of 0.025 mg/l was determined for Gymnodium breve. Previous  studies in which Gymnodium breve was exposed with AES confirm that this  species is highly sensitive to surfactants, and occasionally available  data for Gymnodium breve should therefore not be used for comparison of  the aquatic toxicity between various surfactants.<br />LC50 values have  been found in the range of 1 to 10 mg/l when Daphnia magna were exposed  with LABS homologues between C10 and C13. The acute toxicity of LABS to  Daphnia magna generally increases with increasing alkyl chain length.\u00a0  Typical values lie between 3 and 12 mg/l. <br />A study with the marine  crustacean Acartia tonsa indicated that a C10-13 LAS affected the  survival at 0.54 mg/l (LC50) and the development rate at 0.51 mg/l  (EC50) after 8 days of exposure. The 48 h-LC50 that was obtained in the  same study with Acartia tonsa was 2.1 mg/l. <br />Metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS are reported to have a much lower toxicity to  invertebrates compared to the toxicity of the intact surfactant.<br />The  toxicity of LABS to fish generally increases with increasing alkyl chain  length, and approximately a 10-fold difference in toxicity between  homologues separated by two carbon atoms has been observed. As also  noted for invertebrates, fish are less susceptible to metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS . LC50 values below 1 mg/l were found for  C11.9 (0.71 mg/l), C13 and C14 (both 0.4 mg/l) in studies with fathead  minnow.<br />LABS sorb to sediment with partition coefficients of 50 to  1,000. The toxicity of LABS bound to sediment is relatively low compared  to LABS in solution. NOEC and LOEC values were as high as 319 and 993  mg LABS/kg, respectively, for the sediment-living Chironomus riparius.  The corresponding NOEC for LABS in solution was as low as 2.4 mg/l  indicating that only a small fraction of the sorbed LABS was  bioavailable. LABS dissolved in water may also cause chronic effects  like reduction of the growth rate of the marine mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis. LABS sorbed to sediments did not have similar  effects.<br />Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in  Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment  Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Alkyl-substituted sulfonates have mutagenic potential due to their alkylating properties. Alkylating agents may damage the stem cell which acts as the precursor to components of the blood. Loss of the stem cell may result in pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest. Aplastic anaemia develops due to complete destruction of the stem cells.</p> <p>Absorbed sulfonates are quickly distributed through living systems and are readily excreted. Toxic effects may result from the effects of binding to proteins and the ability of sulfonates to translocate potassium and nitrate (NO3-) ions from cellular to interstitial fluids. Airborne sulfonates may be responsible for respiratory allergies and, in some instances, minor dermal allergies.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Severe acute sodium hydroxide dust inhalation exposure may be fatal due to spasm, inflammation and oedema of the larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and severe pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Symptoms of overexposure include burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea and vomiting.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of sodium hydroxide may result in severe burns to the mouth, throat and stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the larynx and subsequent suffocation, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p> <p>A 1% aqueous solution (pH 13.4)of sodium hydroxide \u00a0failed to cause gastric, oesophageal or other damage in rabbits.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.
