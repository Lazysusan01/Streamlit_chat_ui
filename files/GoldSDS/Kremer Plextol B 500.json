The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Unless inhibited, product may polymerise, raising temperature and pressure, possibly rupturing container. Check inhibitor level periodically, adding to bulk material if needed. In addition, the product's inhibitor(s) require the presence of dissolved oxygen. Maintain, at a minimum, the original headspace in the product container and do NOT blanket or mix with oxygen-free gas as it renders the inhibitor ineffective.

Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%.

The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Workers in plants manufacturing methyl methacrylate have complained of headaches, pains in the extremities, fatigue, sleep disturbance, irritability and loss of memory. A Russian report associated disturbances in the level of insulin, prolactin and circulating somatotropic hormone in women to occupational exposure to methyl methacrylate.</p> <p>Inhalation of 47 ppm in dogs produces hypotension, signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression, hepatic and renal degeneration and death in respiratory arrest</p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>If exposure to highly concentrated vapour atmosphere is prolonged this may lead to narcosis, unconsciousness, even coma and unless resuscitated - death.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Reports of dental technicians, surgeons and manufacturing employees with direct skin contact with methyl methacrylate document paresthesias of the digits and mild local axonal degeneration.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Oral doses of 5 ml/kg methyl methacrylate in dogs produce hypotension, signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression, hepatic and renal degeneration and death in respiratory arrest</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>At sufficiently high doses the material may be hepatotoxic (i.e. poisonous to the liver). Signs may include nausea, stomach pains, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-coloured stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Prolonged and repeated exposures can cause liver and kidney damage. Hypotension induced by methyl methacrylate in surgical bone cement has been followed by cardiac arrest with at least one fatality in a patient undergoing surgery reported.</p> <p>An increased mortality from colon and rectal cancer in white male employees exposed for at least 10-months to acrylate monomer (including methyl methacrylate) has been reported in one cohort but not in others where acrylate exposures were controlled.</p> <p>Incorporation of up to 2000 ppm methyl methacrylate in drinking water of rats for up to two-years did not induce any treatment-related pathology although subcutaneous and intraperitoneal implants of freshly polymerised material for up to 39 months produced local fibrosarcoma.</p> <p>Inhalation of methyl methacrylate by rats and mice of both sexes produced inflammation of the nasal cavity and degeneration of the olfactory sensory epithelium and epithelial hyperplasia of the nasal cavity in mice (exposure occurred over two years)</p>",
