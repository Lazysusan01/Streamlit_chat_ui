When released into water the material readily evaporates and is biodegradable.</p> <p>Ethanol does not bioaccumulate to an appreciable extent.</p> <p>The material is readily degraded by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxy radicals; release into air will result in photodegradation and wet deposition.</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p>TERRESTRIAL FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of ethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. The potential for volatilisation of ethanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mmHg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for ethanol based on half-lives on the order of a few days for ethanol in sandy soil/groundwater microcosms.</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method, volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 39 days, respectively.An estimated BCF= 3, from a log Kow of -0.31 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in sunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for ethanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse or absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Ethanol was degraded with half-lives on the order of a few days in aquatic studies conducted using microcosms constructed with a low organic sandy soil and groundwater, indicating it is unlikely to be persistent in aquatic environments(8).\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: Ethanol, which has an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase ethanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days, calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-12 m3/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>log Kow: -0.31- -0.32</p> <p>Half-life (hr) air: 144</p> <p>Half-life (hr) H2O surface water: 144</p> <p>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 6.29E-06</p> <p>BOD 5 if unstated: 0.93-1.67,63%</p> <p>COD: 1.99-2.11,97%</p> <p>ThOD: 2.1</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For ethanol:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 49-716 ppm (detection), 101 ppm (recognition)</p> <p>Eye and respiratory tract irritation do not appear to occur at exposure levels of less than 5000 ppm and the TLV-TWA is thought to provide an adequate margin of safety against such effects. Experiments in man show that inhalation of 1000 ppm caused slight symptoms of poisoning and 5000 ppm caused strong stupor and morbid sleepiness. Subjects exposed to 5000 ppm to 10000 ppm experienced smarting of the eyes and nose and coughing. Symptoms disappeared within minutes. Inhalation also causes local irritating effects to the eyes and upper respiratory tract, headaches, sensation of heat intraocular tension, stupor, fatigue and a need to sleep. At 15000 ppm there was continuous lachrymation and coughing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The most common signs of inhalation overexposure to ethanol, in animals, include ataxia, incoordination and drowsiness for those surviving narcosis. The narcotic dose for rats, after 2 hours of exposure, is 19260 ppm.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

If oxygen concentrations drop below a minimum level, organisms emigrate, if able and possible, to areas with higher oxygen levels or eventually die.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>",

Undiluted propylene glycol was tested on 1556 persons in a 24 hour patch test. 12.5% showed reactions which were largely toxic (70%) or allergic in nature (30%).

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For isobutane:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Refrigerant Gas: Saturated Hydrocarbons have zero ozone depletion\r\npotential (ODP) and will photodegrade under atmospheric conditions.\r\n&nbsp;[Calor Gas]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental Fate</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Terrestrial fate:&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>&nbsp;An\r\nestimated Koc value of 35 suggests that isobutane will have very high mobility\r\nin soil.

Volatilisation of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07x10-1 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg, and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L. Propane is expected to volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using cell suspensions of microorganisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidised to acetone within 24 hours, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>The estimated Koc value indicates that propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law constant volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are estimated to be 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively. \u00a0An estimated BCF of 13.1 using log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. After 192 hr, the trace concentration of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate</b>:: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour pressure, propane is expected to exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>No health effects were seen in humans exposed at 1,000 ppm isobutane for up to 8 hours or 500 ppm for 8 hours/day for 10 days. Isobutane can have anaesthetic and asphyxiant effects at high concentrations, well above the lower explosion limit of 1.8% (18,000 ppm).</p> <p>Butane is a simple asphyxiant and is mildly anaesthetic at high concentrations (20-25%). 10000 ppm for 10 minutes causes drowsiness.</p> <p>Narcotic effects may be accompanied by exhilaration, dizziness, headache, nausea, confusion, incoordination and unconsciousness in severe cases</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays. They were also non-genotoxic in\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>\u00a0mammalian testing for somatic or germ cell mutations (mouse micronucleus test and rat dominant lethal assay, respectively).</p> <p>Mullin et al: Jnl Applied Toxicology 10, pp 136-142, 2006</p> <p>The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically nontoxic below the lower flammability limit, 18,000 to 50,000 ppm; above this, low to moderate incidental effects such as CNS depression and irritation occur, but are completely reversible upon cessation of the exposure.</p> <p>Common, generalised symptoms associated with non-toxic gas inhalation include :</p> <ul> <li>central nervous system effects such as headache, confusion, dizziness, progressive stupor, coma and seizures;\u00a0</li> <li>respiratory system complications may include tachypnoea and dyspnoea;\u00a0</li> <li>cardiovascular effects may include circulatory collapse and arrhythmias;\u00a0</li> <li>gastrointestinal effects may also be present and may include mucous membrane irritation and nausea and vomiting.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing. Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Hydrocarbons may sensitise the heart to adrenalin and other circulatory catecholamines; as a result cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation may occur. Abrupt collapse may produce traumatic injury. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may be evident early. Symptoms of moderate poisoning may include giddiness, headache, dizziness and nausea. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation. Symptoms include rapid respiration, mental dullness, lack of coordination, poor judgement, nausea and vomiting. The onset of cyanosis may lead to unconsciousness and death.</p>",

                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or skin irritation following contact (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Dermally, isoparaffins have produced slight to moderate irritation in animals and humans under occluded patch conditions where evaporation cannot freely occur. However, they are not irritating in non-occluded tests, which are a more realistic simulation of human exposure. They have not been found to be sensitisers in guinea pig or human patch testing. However, occasional rare idiosyncratic sensitisation reactions in humans have been reported.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Overexposure is unlikely in this form.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments\u00a0</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
