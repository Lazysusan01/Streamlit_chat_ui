Supplied as the hardener, catalyst of many two part packs.|<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyisocyanates or NCO functional\r\nprepolymers used in formulation determine the specific properties of\r\nmoisture-curing 1K coatings.1K coatings do not require a hardener, catalyst or\r\nactivator. This term can be used to describe \u201csingle-component\u201d paints that dry\r\nin the air (whether latex house paint, or old school lacquer) and nearly all\r\naerosol spray can paints.\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Coatings based on aliphatic\r\npolyisocyanates, for example, usually need longer drying times than those based\r\non aromatic polyisocyanates. Drying times depend on the presence of atmospheric\r\nmoisture, as well as the temperature. One-component systems can generally cure\r\nat a wide range of temperatures. Coatings based on polyisocyanates or on\r\nNCO-functional prepolymers may harden at room temperature. Those based on\r\nblocked NCO prepolymers will require baking at temperatures up to 180 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Weathering properties of 1K\r\ncoatings also largely depend on the isocyanate basis used. Coatings based on\r\ntoluylene diisocyanate (TDI) or diphenlymethane diisocyanate (MDI)\r\npolyisocyanates have a tendency to yellow when exposed to light and display a\r\ncertain loss of gloss with weathering. Those based on hexamethylene\r\ndiisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and Desmodur W (H12MDI) are\r\nlight stable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">2K polyurethane (PU) systems dry\r\nrelatively quickly without exposure to heat due to their reactive NCO groups.\r\nIn some applications, these systems are force-dried at up to 80 deg C or baked\r\nat temperatures above 120 deg C to yield even shorter curing times. This\r\nresults in faster production cycles and increased efficiency. A 2K coating is\r\nmixed with a hardener, catalyst or activator. Once it hardens it is much less\r\nsusceptible to damage from chemicals, weather, or UV rays.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Typically the term\r\n\"catalyst\" (as in epoxy catalyst) is used separately from the terms\r\n\"activator\" and \"hardener\" because a catalyst does not have\r\nisocyanate.</span></p>",

All of them function on the  principle of colourimetric evaluation of an indicator paper strip. They  are operating continuously and unattended. Paper tape systems are easy  to use and do not require skilled analysts to operate them. They give  rapid results and are therefore suitable for leak detection and in  emergency situations. However,:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they may read incorrect at very high or very low humidity, </li>\n<li>are unsuitable for aerosols </li>\n<li>and may not be accepted for purposes of regulatory compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Air  monitoring of isocyanates requires sound analytical knowledge. In order  to obtain reliable results only laboratories with experience in that  specific area should be engaged with such measurements<br /><br />In the  evaluation of the German MAK Commission the justification of the OEL for  4,4\u00b4- MDI/ pMDI is established based on the isocyanate (NCO) group  which is common to the monomeric, oligomeric and the polymeric MDIs.  This NCO group is highly reactive (see toxicokinetics and category  justification for details). Due to this high reactivity of the  functional NCO group towards nucleophilic biomolecules the primary  health effect of MDI is irritation at the point of contact, which can be  demonstrated by the numerous acute, subacute and chronic bioassays, and  sensitization.<br />The most sensitive health effect resulting from acute  inhalation exposure to respirable aerosols of MDI is irritation to  predominately the bronchio-alveolar part of the respiratory tract.<br />After  inhalation exposure, MDI reacts with nucleophilic low and  higher-molecular components of the liquid films that cover the airways,  glutathione (GSH) represents the most important nucleophile in  quantitative terms. The low-molecular adducts or conjugates of MDI are  absorbed and direct transcarbamoylation results in plasma protein  adducts (albumin, haemoglobin). All observed health effects resulting  from exposure to respirable aerosols in acute, subchronic or chronic  bioassays and human studies can be allocated to primary alveolar  reactivity (respiratory irritation and/or sensitization). No systemic  effect other than secondary to primary irritation has been described. <br />Biomonitoring  for exposure to diisocyanates typically looks to assay derivatives  (diamines) following hydrolysis of biological fluids and is routinely  employed to measure occupational exposure to MDI and other  diisocyanates. For diamine analysis, samples of urine are typically  used, although blood samples can also be used. However, these markers  are not specific for the diisocyanate exposure. The urine biomarkers  (after acid or base hydrolysis) reflected recent exposures whereas  certain haemoglobin (Hb)\u00a0 biomarkers did not necessarily correlate with  the urine biomarkers, and were considered to reflect overall exposures  over a longer term. The hydrolysis methods and conditions used release  differing amounts of the diamine analyte.<br />Hydrolysis analytes are at  low concentrations and proportionally little of the dose is in urine or  blood, and that there is no standardised method for measuring biomarkers  in hydrolyzed urine. Investigation of diisocyanate specific biomarkers  has focused on the conjugated molecules in blood. Typically, conjugates  with Hb or albumin (Alb) have been assessed, and\u00a0 there has been  progress in application of experiments in animals to biomonitoring of  human exposures to MDI. \u00a0<br />The role for glutathione as an intermediary  in transport of diisocyanates is now supported by good evidence using  various model compounds. The most probable reactions of isocyanates with  biological macromolecules are with the amine (mixed urea), the hydroxyl  (carbamate) and the sulphydryl (thiolytic acid ester) and that latter  is of a reversible nature.<br />The thiocarbamate bond of  isocyanate-sulphydryl is reversible, and various authors have found  release and transfer of MDI moieties from thiocarbamate conjugates to  other nucleophiles, notably protein. The conjugates were shown to be  recognised by serum IgG from MDI exposed workers, demonstrating a  non-enzymatic, thiol-mediated transcarbamolyating mechanism to protein. <br />The  methods to identify and quantify MDI-adducts to plasma proteins  particularly albumin (Alb) and to haemoglobin (Hb) have now been applied  to biological monitoring, particularly useful since the amount of  adducts would be indicative of an integrated exposure. In addition these  adducts are specific for MDI exposure. However the total amount of the  analyte MDA, retrievable from Hb-adducts and urinary precursors,  accounts for less than 0.5 % of the applied dose of MDI, and the lack of  linearity of biomarker to exposure dose makes uncertain the  extrapolation from the yield of biomarkers in urine or blood towards  inhalative MDI exposure. The use of protein adducts for biomonitoring  appears to overcome some of these difficulties and benefits from  specificity of the analyte. To date no diisocyanate specific urinary  biomarker has been identified. For blood, the MDI-specific methods  developed are: Hb-conjugate derived hydantoin, Alb-lysine conjugates and  peptide conjugates. On the basis of limits of detection, the  Hb-hydantoin method is most sensitive compared to the Alb-lysine method  which in turn is more sensitive than the signature peptide method. The  Hb-hydantoin method covers a longer period of exposure than the  Alb-lysine, due to the longer half life of the erythrocyte compared to  serum albumin.</p> <p>for diphenylmethane diisocyanate (methylene bisphenyl isocyanate; MDI)<br />Odour Threshold Value: 0.39 ppm<br />IDLH Level: 10 mg/m3<br />Mean MDI exposures of less than 0.003 ppm appear to have no acute or chronic effect on pulmonary function.<br />MDI produces identical toxicological responses to those produced by TDI and the recommended TLV-TWA is identical for the two isocyanates. Exposure at or below the recommended value is thought to protect the worker against pulmonary function decrements as well as to minimise the potential for respiratory tract sensitisation. Individuals who may be hypersusceptible or otherwise unusually responsive to exposure to certain industrial chemicals may not adequately protected from adverse health effects caused by MDI at the recommended TLV-TWA. Ceiling values recommended by NIOSH and OSHA are synonymous with normal excursions allowable for exposures to the TLV-TWA (in excess of 3 x TLV-TWA for no more than a total of 30 minutes during a work day but in any case not exceeding 5 x TLV-TWA).</p>",

Reaction products will be a variety of polyureas and macromolecular  conjugates with for example mucus, proteins and cell components. <br />This  is corroborated by the results from an MDI inhalation study. Following  an inhalation exposure of rats to radiolabelled MDI, 79% of the dose was  excreted in faeces. The faecal excretion in these animals was  considered entirely due to ingestion of radioactivity from grooming and  ingestion of deposited material from the nasopharangeal region via the  mucociliary escalator, i.e. not following systemic absorption.

Thus, for  MDI and diisocyanates in general the oral gavage dosing route is  inappropriate for toxicological studies and risk assessment. <br />It is  expected that oral gavage dosing will result in a similar outcome to  that produced by TDI or MDI, that is (1) reaction with stomach contents  and (2) polymerization to solid polyureas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reaction with  stomach contents is very plausibly described in case reports of  accidental ingestion of polymeric MDI based glue in domestic animals.

Overall, the tumour incidence, both benign and malignant and\u00a0 the number of animals with the tumours were not different from controls.The increased incidence of lung tumours is associated with prolonged respiratory irritation and the concurrent accumulation of yellow material in the lung, which occurred throughout the study.In the absence of prolonged exposure to high concentrations leading to chronic irritation and lung damage,it is highly unlikely that tumour formation will occur.</p> <p>Isocyanate vapours/mists are irritating to the upper respiratory tract and lungs; the response may be severe enough to produce bronchitis with wheezing, gasping and severe distress, even sudden loss of consciousness, and pulmonary oedema.
