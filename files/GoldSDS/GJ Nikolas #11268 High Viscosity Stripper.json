A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Volatilisation of\r\nmethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process\r\ngiven a Henry's Law constant of 4.55x10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for\r\nvolatilisation of methanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon a vapor\r\npressure of 127 mm Hg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate\r\nprocess for methanol based on half-lives of 1 and 3.2 days measured in a sandy\r\nsilt loam and sandy loam from Texas and Mississippi, respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">AQUATIC FATE: The estimated Koc indicates that methanol is not\r\nexpected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water\r\nsurfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law\r\nconstant estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake\r\nare 3 and 35 days, respectively. A BCF of less than 10 measured in fish, suggests\r\nbioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in\r\nsunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate\r\nprocess for methanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse\r\nor absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Methanol has been\r\nshown to undergo rapid biodegradation in a variety of screening studies using\r\nsewage seed and activated sludge inoculum, which suggests that biodegradation\r\nwill occur in aquatic environments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle\r\npartitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour\r\npressure, methanol is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient\r\natmosphere. Vapour-phase methanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction\r\nwith photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this\r\nreaction in air is estimated to be 17 days, calculated from its rate constant\r\nof 9.4x10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h) fathead minnow\u00a0<i>(Pimephales promelus)</i>\u00a029000\r\nmg/l; rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhyncus mykiss</i>) 19000 mg/l; bluegill (<i>Lepomis\r\nmacrochirus</i>) 15400 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (7 d): guppy 10860 mg/l (14 d): 11.5 mg/l (semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia pulex LC50 (18 h): 19500 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brine shrimp (<i>Artemia salina</i>) LC50 24 h): 1101.46-1578.84\r\nmg/l (static)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brown shrimp (<i>Crangon crangon</i>) LC50 (96 h): 1340 mg/l\r\n(semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) LC50 (96 h): 15900 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Marine bacterium (<i>Photobacterium posphoreum</i>) LC50 (4 h):\r\n7690 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Protozoa (<i>Tetrahymena pyriformis</i>) LC50 (48 h) 18756 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",
