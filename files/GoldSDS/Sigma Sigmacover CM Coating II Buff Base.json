The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine).

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage.

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>aldehydes</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

A number of BPA-degrading bacteria have been\r\nisolated from enrichments of sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The first\r\nstep in the biodegradation of BPA is the hydroxylation of the carbon atom of a\r\nmethyl group or the quaternary carbon in the BPA molecule.

Loss of the stem cell may result in  pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and  platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the  individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular  leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder  involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red  blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant.

This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted.

They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride\r\n(PVC).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Lower-molecular-weight\r\nphthalates, those derived from C3-C6 alcohols, are being gradually replaced in\r\nmany products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health\r\nconcerns\u00a0 They are replaced by high-molecular-weight phthalates (those with\r\nmore than 6 carbons in their backbone, which gives them increased permanency\r\nand durability). In 2010, the market was still dominated by high-phthalate\r\nplasticizers; however, due to legal provisions and growing environmental\r\nawareness and perceptions, producers are increasingly forced to use\r\nnon-phthalate plasticizers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phthalates are used in a large\r\nvariety of products, from enteric coatings of pharmaceutical pills and\r\nnutritional supplements to viscosity control agents, gelling agents, film\r\nformers, stabilizers, dispersants, lubricants, binders, emulsifying agents, and\r\nsuspending agents. End-applications include adhesives and glues, agricultural\r\nadjuvants, building materials, personal-care products, medical devices,\r\ndetergents and surfactants, packaging, children's toys, modelling clay, waxes,\r\npaints, printing inks and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, and\r\ntextiles. Phthalates are also frequently used in soft plastic fishing lures, caulk,\r\npaint pigments, and sex toys made of so-called \"jelly rubber\".\r\nPhthalates are used in a variety of household applications such as shower\r\ncurtains, vinyl upholstery, adhesives, floor tiles, food containers and\r\nwrappers, and cleaning materials. Personal-care items containing phthalates\r\ninclude perfume, eye shadow, moisturizer, nail polish, liquid soap, and hair</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phthalates are also found in\r\nmodern electronics and medical applications such as catheters and blood\r\ntransfusion devices. The most widely used phthalates are di(2-ethylhexyl)\r\nphthalate (DEHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and diisononyl phthalate (DINP).\r\nDEHP was the dominant plasticizer used globally in PVC due to its low cost.\r\nBenzylbutylphthalate (BBP) is used in the manufacture of foamed PVC, which is\r\nused mostly as a flooring material, although its use is decreasing rapidly in\r\nthe Western countries. Phthalates with small R and R' groups are used as\r\nsolvents in perfumes and pesticides</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Plasticiser (plasticizer, dispersant); a substance which when\r\nadded to a material, usually a plastic, makes it flexible, resilient and easier\r\nto handle.

There is an apparent cut-off in acute toxicity at dihexyl phthalate and higher; these results are further confirmed with QSAR modeling. Both calculated and measured values for environmental toxicity endpoints predict no effects at the limit of water solubility for dihexyl phthalate and higher. The data for the higher molecular weight transitional phthalates together with read-across data provide sufficient test data to suggest that these phthalates have no associated acute or chronic aquatic toxicity. This cut-off in acute toxicity is due to the concentration causing acute toxicity being higher than the water solubility of the phthalate ester.</p> <p>The same situation exists for those phthalates which are more non-polar (higher carbon number) than dihexyl phthalate. This is confirmed by a lack of acute toxicity to fish, invertebrates, or algae for diheptyl phthalate (DHP), di-iso-heptyl phthalate (DIHP). The same situation exists for those phthalates which are more non-polar (higher carbon number) than dihexyl phthalate. This is confirmed by a lack of acute toxicity to fish, invertebrates, or algae for DHP, DIHP, \u00a0</p> <p>The better solubility and thus the higher availability of the phthalates with short alkyl chains leads to a higher toxicity. Concurrently they are available for degrading microorganisms and therefore not persistent. The compounds with higher molecular weight and a low solubility are strongly adsorbed to soil and to suspended particulate matter in water. Therefore they are not very accessible to biochemical processes leading to degradation.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for phthalate esters:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phthalates are easily released\r\ninto the environment. In general, they do not persist due to rapid\r\nbiodegradation, photodegradation, and anaerobic degradation. Outdoor air\r\nconcentrations are higher in urban and suburban areas than in rural and remote\r\nareas. They also pose no acute toxicity. In general, children's exposure to\r\nphthalates is greater than that of adults</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate;</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Under aerobic and anaerobic\r\nconditions, studies reveal that many phthalate esters are degraded by a wide\r\nrange of bacteria and actinomycetes. Standardized aerobic biodegradation tests\r\nwith sewage sludge inocula show that within 28 days approximately 50% ultimate\r\ndegradation occurs. Biodegradation is, therefore, expected to be the dominant\r\npathway in surface soils and sediments. In the atmosphere, photodegradation via\r\nfree radical attack is the anticipated dominant pathway. The half-life of many\r\nphthalate esters is ca. 1 day in the air, from &lt; 1 day to 2 weeks in surface\r\nand marine waters, and from &lt; 1 week to several months in soils.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phthalates are high molecular\r\nweight chemicals, and are not expected to partition significantly to air.\r\nHowever for the minor amount that may partition to air, modelled predictions\r\nindicate that they would be rapidly oxidised: with a\u00a0 predicted atmospheric\r\noxidation half-life of around 0.52 days . They are expected to react\r\nappreciably with other photo oxidative species in the atmosphere, such as O3.\r\nTherefore, it is expected that reactions with hydroxyl radicals will be the\r\nmost important fate process in the atmosphere for phthalates</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation of phthalate\r\nesters in the aquatic and terrestrial food chain is limited by\r\nbiotransformation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most phthalates have experimental\r\nbioaccumulation factor (BCFs) and bioconcentration factor (BAFs) below 5000\r\nL/kg, as they are readily metabolised by fish</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A study of 18 commercial\r\nphthalate esters with alkyl chains ranging from one to 13 carbons found an\r\neight order of magnitude increase in octanol-water coefficients (Kow) and a\r\nfour order of magnitude decrease in vapor pressure with increasing length. This\r\nincrease in Kow and decrease in vapor pressure results in increased\r\npartitioning of the phthalate esters to suspended solids, soils, sediments, and\r\naerosols</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The phthalate esters are\r\ndistributed throughout the environment ubiquitously.

Fulvic acid appears to act as a solubiliser for the otherwise\r\ninsoluble ester and serves to mediate its transport and mobilisation in water\r\nor immobilisation in soil. Phthalate esters have been found in open ocean\r\nenvironments, in deep sea jelly fish, Atlantic herring and in mackerel.\r\nPhthalic ester plasticisers are clearly recognised as general contaminants of\r\nalmost every soil and water ecosystem. In general they have low acute toxicity\r\nbut the weight of evidence supporting their carcinogenicity is substantial.\r\nOther subtle chronic effects have also been reported. As little as 4 ug/ml in\r\nculture medium is lethal to chick embryo heart cells. This concentration is\r\nsimilar to that reached in human blood stored in vinyl plastic bags for as\r\nlittle as one day.\u00a0 As phthalates are present in drinking water and food,\r\nconcerns have been raised about their long term effects on humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Some phthalates (notably\r\ndi-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate) may be detrimental to the\r\nreproduction of the water flea (Daphnia magna), zebra fish and guppies</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While phthalates may have very\r\nlow true water solubilities, they possess the ability to form suspensions which\r\nmay cause adverse effects through physical contact with <i>Daphnia</i> at very\r\nlow concentrations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available toxicity and water\r\nsolubility information suggest that the high molecular weight phthalates, form\r\nthese suspensions and are able to elicit chronic toxic effects at\r\nconcentrations of approximately 0.05 mg/L .

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Phthalates (aromatic dicarboxylic acid esters), in general, exhibit low toxicity, partly because of poor absorption but mainly as a result of rapid metabolism in which the esters are saponified to phthalic acid (which is rapidly excreted) and the parent alcohol (which is subsequently metabolised). The pathology of these compounds seems to be related to the released alcohol and its biological effects. The rate of absorption of ingested phthalate esters is influenced by the content of dietary fat. Ingested phthalate esters may to a lesser degree be absorbed as the monoester derivatives or in the case of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, as the diester. Cumulative toxicity of the phthalates has been observed on repeated administration. Both di-n-octyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate were found to have 22-28 times greater toxicity (based on LD50s) following repeated administration to animals. The liver has been shown to be the target organ affected by the phthalates. In general phthalates have induced liver enlargement; this increase in liver weight has been attributed to rapid cell division (hyperplasia) along with the detachment of cells (hypertrophy). The increase in liver weight caused by phthalates has been found to reverse to normal or even below normal levels on prolonged exposure.</p>\n<p>Exposure to phthalates, in general, has been found to be associated with a reduction in circulating cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels which accounted for a reduction in liver steroidogenesis. The phthalates also effect carbohydrate metabolism in the liver producing depleted glycogen electron transport inhibitors following interaction with mitochondria. Testicular atrophy produced in rats during feeding studies depends on the length and structure of the alcohol; in general the lower molecular weight esters produce the more severe effects. The toxicity of phthalic acid isomers decreases in the order o-phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Phthalic acid is not metabolised but is excreted, unchanged, in the urine and faeces. Terephthalic acid appears to potentiate the biological effects of substances such as antibiotics, thiamine and sulfonamides.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p><br /></p> <p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in impaired fertility on the basis of: - clear evidence in animal studies of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which is not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p><p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity, generally on the basis of:</p> <p>- clear results in appropriate animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>The various phthalates have different uses, chemical structures and toxicity profiles. It is therefore difficult to generalise about the safety of all phthalates as a group. The main health concern associated with some phthalates is that animal studies have shown that high regular doses can affect the reproductive system in developing young, particularly males. While there is no significant risk to the general population, young children may experience higher exposures than the general population if they chew or suck on phthalate-containing toys, or if they ingest phthalates over a long period from other products containing high levels of phthalates.</p>\n<p>In animal tests, phthalates have been shown to \"feminise\" male animals, increasing the likelihood of small or undeveloped testes, undescended testicles, and low sperm counts. A 2005 study also linked higher foetal exposure to phthalates through the mother's blood with increased risk of developmental abnormalities in male infants. Higher phthalate levels are also associated with lower testosterone production and reduced sperm count in men.</p>\n<p>One study suggested that high levels of phthalates may be connected to the current obesity epidemic in children. It was found that obese children show greater exposure to phthalates than non-obese children. It was reported that the obesity risk increases according to the level of the chemical found in the children's bloodstream. in a national cross-section of U.S. men, concentrations of several prevalent phthalate metabolites showed statistically significant correlations with abnormal obesity and insulin resistance. A further study found that people with elevated phthalate levels had roughly twice the risk of developing diabetes compared with those with lower levels. This study also found that phthalates were associated with disrupted insulin production.</p>\n<p>Much of the current research on effects of phthalate exposure has been focused towards children and men's health, however, women may be at higher risk for potential adverse health effects of phthalates due to increased cosmetic use.\u00a0 According to in vivo and observational studies there is an association between phthalate exposure and endocrine disruption leading to development of breast cancer. This finding may be associated with the demethylation of the oestrogen receptor complex in breast cancer cells.</p>\n<p>A Russian study describes exposure by workers to mixed phthalates (and other plasticisers) - pain, numbness and spasms in the upper and lower extremities were related to duration of exposures. Symptoms usually developed after the sixth or seventh year of work. Neurological studies revealed the development of polyneuritis in about 30% of the workers involved in this study. About 30% of the workforce showed depression of the vestibular receptors. Because the study described mixed exposures it is difficult to determine what, if any, unique role was played by the phthalates. Increased incidences of anovulatory reproductive cycles and low oestrogen concentrations were reported among Russian women working with phthalate plasticisers; the abnormal cycles were associated with spontaneous abortion. The specific phthalates implicated, dose levels and other data were not reported. It has been alleged that the phthalates mimic or interfere with sex packaging) and are used as ingredients in paints, inks and adhesives. Their potential for entering the human body is marked. They have been added to a list of chemicals (including alkyl phenolics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins) which are implicated in reducing sperm counts and fertility in males a phenomenon which has apparently arisen since the mid 1960s.</p>\n<p>Phthalates are generally considered to be in a class of endocrine disruptors known as \"xenoestrogens,\" for their ability to mimic the effect of oestrogen on the body.</p>\n<p>Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants</p>\n<p>Human phthalate exposure during pregnancy results in decreased anogenital distance among baby boys.Boys born to mothers with the highest levels of phthalates were 7 times more likely to have a shortened anogenital distance.</p>\n<p>While anogenital distance is routinely used as a measure of foetal exposure to endocrine disruptors in animals, this parameter is rarely assessed in humans, and its significance is unknown</p>\n<p>One study also found that female animals exposed to higher levels of phthalates experienced increased risk of miscarriage, a common symptom of excessive estrogen levels in human women, and stillbirth. Prematurity may also be linked to phthalate exposure.</p>\n<p>Another study found a link between exposure to phthalates and increased rates of childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>In adult human men, phthalates have been linked to greater waist circumference and higher insulin resistance, a common precursor to type 2 (adult onset) diabetes. They have been linked to thyroid irregularities, asthma, and skin allergies in both sexes. Though the exact mechanism is unclear, studies have linked higher rates of respiratory infections and other symptoms in children living in houses with vinyl floors. One possible explanation is inhalation of dust tainted by phthalates, which are used in cosmetics such as nail polishes and hand creams precisely because of their ability to bind to human tissues.</p>\n<p>Animal studies have shown increased risks of certain birth defects (including the genital abnormalities and, in rats, extra ribs) and low birth rates in rats whose mothers were fed higher levels of phthalates.</p>\n<p>These effects on foetal development are of particular concern because young women of childbearing age often have higher than average phthalate levels in the body thanks to their use of cosmetics, many of which contain phthalates.</p>\n<p>The EU has applied limitations to the use of several phthalates in general food contact applications (packaging and closures) and medical device applications. The USA\u00a0 has introduced regulation of phthalate esters as components of children's toys and childcare articles for children under the age of 12 that could be 'placed in the mouth'.</p>\n<p>Endocrine disruptors such as phthalates can be add to the effects of other endocrine disruptors, so even very small amounts can interact with other chemicals to have cumulative, adverse \"cocktail effects\"</p>\n<p>Large amounts of specific phthalates fed to rodents have been shown to damage their liver and testes, and initial rodent studies also indicated hepatocarcinogenicity. Later studies on primates showed that the mechanism is specific to rodents - humans are resistant to the effect</p>\n<p>Studies conducted on mice exposed to phthalates in utero did not result in metabolic disorder in adults. However, \"At least one phthalate, monoethyhexyl phthalate (MEHP) has been found to interact with all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in lipid and carbohdrate metabolism.</p>\n<p>Prenatal exposure to phthalates may affect children's mental, motor and behavioral development during the preschool year.</p>\n<p>A 2009 study found that prenatal phthalate exposure was related to low birth weight in infants. Low birth weight is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age and increases the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in adulthood. Another study found that women who deliver prematurely have, on average, up to three times the phthalate level in their urine compared to women who carry to term.</p>\n<p>Several findings point to a statistically significant correlation between urine phthalate concentrations in children and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">2-Ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) its\r\nesters and its salts are of concern to human health because of their potential\r\nto induce carcinogenicity, liver toxicity and developmental/reproductive\r\ntoxicity. 2-EHA is of low acute oral and dermal toxicity, is a mild skin\r\nirritant and a severe eye irritant.

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
