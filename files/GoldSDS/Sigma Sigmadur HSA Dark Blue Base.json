This macrocyclic structure like porphyrins(biopigments) is highly coloured Phthalocyanine derivatives derived from the basic compound of (C6H4C2N)4N4 are used as light-fast blue or green pigments. The hosted metals and substituted groups result in distinct colors; phthalocyanine (blue-green), copper phthalocyanine (blue), chlorinated copper phthalocyanine (green), and sulfonated copper phthalocyanine (green). They have also been involved in the study of photosensitizer chemistry or metal complex chemistry such as transition-metal complex catalyst chemistry for uniform polymerization, luminescence chemistry and spectrophotometric analysis, organic synthesis and polymerization. Phthalocyanine pigments are used in enamels, linoleum, inks, plastics, and rubber goods. Photoisomerizable phthalocyanines are used in rewritable CD or DVD printing. Some phthalocyanines such as fluoraluminium phthalocyanine are used in cancer treatment.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Due to\u00a0<i>pi</i>-electron cloud overlaps, phthalocyanines exhibit semiconductor property. Organic semiconductors have some merits of self radiation, flexibility, light weight, easy fabrication, and low cost. They have been investigated as organic electroluminescence materials for the applications in organic solar cells, biosensitizers and display devices such as OLED(Organic Light Emitting Diode), OTFT(Organic Thin Film Transistor), Wearable Display, and e-paper.</p>|Used in oil, inks, emulsion paint, plastics, paper, chalks and pencils. Used in organic solar cell research.  In the development of quantum computing due to the length of time its electrons can exist in a state of quantum superposition. CuPc can be easily processed into a thin film for use in device fabrication, which makes it an attractive qubit candidate",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

Animal studies, in part, appear to support this proposition</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Phthalocyanine dyes are probably not biodegradable. Reversible reduction and decolourisation occurs under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>Many dyes are visible in water at concentrations as low as 1 mg/l Textile-processing waste waters, typically with a dye content in the range 10- 200 mg /l are therefore usually highly coloured and discharge in open waters presents an aesthetic problem. As dyes are designed to be chemically and photolytically stable, they are highly persistent in natural environments. The release of dyes may therefore present an ecotoxic hazard and introduces the potential danger of bioaccumulation that may eventually affect man by transport through the food chain.</p> <p>Algae are generally susceptible to dyes, but the inhibitory effect is thought to be related to light inhibition at high dye concentrations, rather than a direct inhibitory effect of the dyes. This effect may account for up to 50% of the inhibition observed.</p> <p>Virtually all dyes from all chemically distinct groups are prone to fungal oxidation but there are large differences between fungal species with respect to their catalysing power and dye selectivity. A clear relationship between dye structure and fungal dye biodegradability has not been established. Fungal degradation of aromatic structures is a secondary metabolic event that starts when nutrients (C, N and S) become limiting. Therefore, while the enzymes are optimally expressed under starving conditions, supplementation of energy substrates and nutrients are necessary for propagation of the cultures.</p> <p>The effects of the substitutional pattern of the dyes are inconclusive, but it has been suggested that introduction of the functional groups; methyl, nitro, sulfo or acid, weakens the inhibition of bacteria, whereas introduction of chlorine and bromine strengthens the inhibition</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Symptoms may be delayed for up to 12 hours and begin with the sudden onset of thirst, and a sweet, metallic or foul taste in the mouth. Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Exposure to copper, by skin, has come from its use in pigments, ointments, ornaments, jewellery, dental amalgams and IUDs and as an antifungal agent and an algicide. Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction. Copper salts often produce an itching eczema in contact with skin. This is, likely, of a non-allergic nature.</span></p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p> <p>Because of similarities in structure to thalidomide, concerns have been raised about the potential teratogenicity of all phthalimides (the basic building block of phthalocyanine). Animal studies, in part, appear to support this proposition.</p>\n<p>The phthalimide fungicides are typically teratogens. Captan, for example, is teratogenic, foetotoxic, and/or embryotoxic in a variety of rodent species and has caused stillbirths in dogs. Folpet was teratogenic in</p>\n<p>rabbits, chicks, and hamsters. Captafol has been embryo-or foetotoxic in experimental animals.Captan, folpet, and captafol have all induced testicular degeneration in laboratory animals.</p>",

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Vomitus frequently contains blood, due in part to capillary dilation and blood loss through gastrointestinal walls (diapedesis). Watery diarrhoea with ribbons of bowel mucosa contribute to cardiovascular collapse from fluid and electrolyte loss. Although a quiescent period may follow some victims relapse within 12 hours into lethal secondary shock. During relapse a profound metabolic acidosis is encountered. This has been attributed to hydrolysis of ferric ions in blood as well as increases in the level of lactic and citric acids. Respiratory changes resulting from acidosis are often evident. Postmortem examination often reveals liver damage consisting of periportal haemorrhagic necrosis. Poisoning may also produce a metallic taste, restlessness, lethargy, hypotonia, coma, pallor or cyanosis, fast, weak pulse, hypotension, hyperventilation (due to acidosis), shock, vasomotor instability and cardiovascular collapse. Pneumonitis, pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage, convulsions, liver impairment with jaundice, hypoglycaemia, multiple coagulation defects, kidney damage with anuria, pancreatic damage, vascular damage, hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, profound shock and vascular collapse have been reported. Survivors may display gastric scarring or obstruction, pyloric obstruction or stenosis, mild hepatic scirrhosis or neuralgic sequelae.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>Chronic excessive iron exposure has been associated with haemosiderosis and consequent possible damage to the liver and pancreas. Haemosiderin is a golden-brown insoluble protein produced by phagocytic digestion of haematin (an iron-based pigment). Haemosiderin is found in most tissues, especially in the liver, in the form of granules. Other sites of haemosiderin deposition include the pancreas and skin. A related condition, haemochromatosis, which involves a disorder of metabolism of these deposits, may produce cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, and bronze pigmentation of the skin - heart failure may eventually occur.</p> <p>\u00a0Such exposure may also produce conjunctivitis, choroiditis, retinitis (both inflammatory conditions involving the eye) and siderosis of tissues if iron remains in these tissues. Siderosis is a form of pneumoconiosis produced by iron dusts. Siderosis also includes discoloration of organs, excess circulating iron and degeneration of the retina, lens and uvea as a result of the deposition of intraocular iron. Siderosis might also involve the lungs - involvement rarely develops before ten years of regular exposure. Often there is an accompanying inflammatory reaction of the bronchi. Permanent scarring of the lungs does not normally occur.</p> <p>\u00a0High levels of iron may raise the risk of cancer. This concern stems from the theory that iron causes oxidative damage to tissues and organs by generating highly reactive chemicals, called free radicals, which subsequently react with DNA. Cells may be disrupted and may be become cancerous. People whose genetic disposition prevents them from keeping tight control over iron (e.g. those with the inherited disorder, haemochromatosis) may be at increased risk.</p> <p>Iron overload in men may lead to diabetes, arthritis, liver cancer, heart irregularities and problems with other organs as iron builds up.</p> <p>\u00a0[K.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine).

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "Environment": "<p>for inorganic sulfates:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Data from tap water studies with human volunteers indicate that sulfates produce a laxative effect at concentrations of 1000 - 1200 mg/litre, but no increase in diarrhoea, dehydration or weight loss. The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable taste; the lowest taste threshold concentration for sulfate is approximately 250 mg/litre as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems. No health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/litre.</p> <p>Sulfates are removed from the air by both dry and wet deposition processes. Wet deposition processes including rain-out (a process that occurs within the clouds) and washout (removal by precipitation below the clouds) contribute to the removal of sulfate from the atmosphere.</p> <p>In soil, the inorganic sulfates can adsorb to soil particles or leach into surface water and groundwater. Sulfates can be taken up by plants and be incorporated into the parenchyma of the plant.</p> <p>Sulfate in water can also be reduced by sulfate bacteria (<i>Thiobacilli</i>) which use them as a source of energy.</p> <p>In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle. Sodium sulfate is not reactive in aqueous solution at room temperature. Sodium sulfate will completely dissolve, ionise and distribute across the entire planetary \"aquasphere\". Some sulfates may eventually be deposited, the majority of sulfates participate in the sulfur cycle in which natural and industrial sodium sulfate are not distinguishable</p> <p>The BCF of sodium sulfate is very low and therefore significant bioconcentration is not expected. Sodium and sulfate ions are essential to all living organisms and their intracellular and extracellular concentrations are actively regulated. However some plants (e.g. corn and\u00a0<i>Kochia Scoparia</i>), are capable of accumulating sulfate to concentrations that are potentially toxic to ruminants.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For sulfate in general:</p> <p>Fish LC50: \u00a0toxic from 7000 mg/l</p> <p>Bacteria: toxic from \u00a02500 mg/l</p> <p>Algae were shown to be the most sensitive to sodium sulfate; EC50 120 h = 1,900 mg/l. For invertebrates\u00a0<i>(Daphnia magna)\u00a0</i>the EC50 48 h = 4,580 mg/l and fish appeared to be the least sensitive with a LC50 96h = 7,960 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>. Activated sludge showed a very low sensitivity to sodium sulfate. There was no effect up to 8 g/l. Sodium sulfate is not very toxic to terrestrial plants.\u00a0<i>Picea banksiana\u00a0</i>was the most sensitive species, an effect was seen at 1.4 g/l. Sediment dwelling organisms were not very sensitive either, with an LC50 96h = 660 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Trycorythus sp</i>. Overall it can be concluded that sodium sulfate has no acute adverse effect on aquatic and sediment dwelling organisms. Toxicity to terrestrial plants is also low.</p> <p>No data were found for long term toxicity. The acute studies all show a toxicity of sodium sulfate higher than 100 mg/l, no bioaccumulation is expected,</p> <p><span>For barium and its compounds::</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The length of time that barium will last in\r\nair, land, water, or sediments following release of barium into these media\r\ndepends on the form of barium released. Barium compounds that do not dissolve\r\nwell in water, such as barium sulfate and barium carbonate, can persist for a\r\nlong time in the environment. Barium compounds, such as barium chloride, barium\r\nnitrate, or barium hydroxide, that dissolve easily in water usually do not last\r\nin these forms for a long time in the environment. The barium in these\r\ncompounds that is dissolved in water quickly combines with sulfate or carbonate\r\nthat are naturally found in water and become the longer lasting forms (barium\r\nsulfate and barium carbonate). </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Under natural conditions, barium is stable\r\nin the +2 valence state and is found primarily in the form of inorganic\r\ncomplexes. Conditions such as pH, Eh (oxidation-reduction potential), cation\r\nexchange capacity, and the presence of sulfate, carbonate, and metal oxides\r\n(e.g., oxides of aluminum, manganese, silicon, and titanium) will affect the\r\npartitioning of barium and its compounds in the environment. The major features\r\nof the biogeochemical cycle of barium include wet and dry deposition to land\r\nand surface water, leaching from geological formations to groundwater,\r\nadsorption to soil and sediment particulates, and biomagnification in\r\nterrestrial and aquatic food chains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium is a highly reactive metal that\r\noccurs naturally only in a combined state. The element is released to\r\nenvironmental media by both natural processes and anthropogenic sources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The general population is exposed to barium\r\nthrough consumption of drinking water and foods, usually at low levels. Most\r\nbarium released to the environment from industrial sources is in forms that do\r\nnot become widely dispersed. In the atmosphere, barium is likely to be present\r\nin particulate form. Although chemical reactions may cause changes in\r\nspeciation of barium in air, the main mechanisms for the removal of barium\r\ncompounds from the atmosphere are likely to be wet and dry deposition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In aquatic media, barium is likely to\r\nprecipitate out of solution as an insoluble salt (i.e., as BaSO4 or BaCO3).\r\nWaterborne barium may also adsorb to suspended particulate matter through the\r\nformation of ion pairs with natural anions such as bicarbonate or sulfate in\r\nthe matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Precipitation of barium sulfate salts is\r\naccelerated when rivers enter the ocean because of the high sulfate content\r\n(905 mg/L) in the ocean. It is estimated that only 0.006% of the total barium\r\ninput into oceans from freshwater sources remains in solution. Sedimentation of\r\nsuspended solids removes a large portion of the barium content from surface\r\nwaters. There is evidence to suggest that the precipitation of barium from the\r\nsurface of fresh and marine waters occurs, in part, as the result of the barite\r\ncrystal formation in microorganisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium in sediments is found largely in the\r\nform of barium sulfate (barite). Coarse silt sediment in a turbulent\r\nenvironment will often grind and cleave the barium sulfate from the sediment\r\nparticles leaving a buildup of dense barites. Estimated soil:water distribution\r\ncoefficients (Kd) (i.e., the ratio of the quantity of barium sorbed per gram of\r\nsorbent to the concentration of barium remaining in solution at equilibrium)\r\nrange from 200 to 2,800 for sediments and sandy loam soils. The uptake of\r\nbarium by fish and marine organisms is also an important removal mechanism.\r\nBarium levels in sea water range from 2 to 63 \u00b5g/L with a mean concentration of\r\nabout 13 \u00b5g/L. Barium was found to bioconcentrate in marine plants by a factor\r\nof 400-4,000 times the level present in the water. Bioconcentration factors in\r\nmarine animals, plankton, and brown algae of 100, 120, and 260, respectively,\r\nhave been reported. In freshwater, a bioconcentration factor of 129 was\r\nestimated in fish where the barium in water was 0.07 mg/L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium added to soils (e.g., from the land\r\nfarming of waste drilling muds) may either be taken up by vegetation or\r\ntransported through soil with precipitation. Relative to the amount of barium\r\nfound in soils, little is typically bioconcentrated by plants. For example, a\r\nbioconcentration factor of 0.4 has been estimated for plants in a Virginia\r\nfloodplain with a barium soil concentration of 104.2 mg/kg . However, there are\r\nsome plants, such as legumes, forage plants, Brazil nuts, and mushrooms that\r\naccumulate barium. Bioconcentration factors from 2 to 20 have been reported for\r\ntomatoes and soybeans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium is not very mobile in most soil\r\nsystems, due to the formation of water-insoluble salts and an inability of the\r\nbarium ion to form soluble complexes with fulvic and humic acids. The rate of\r\ntransportation of barium in soil is dependent on the characteristics of the\r\nsoil material. Soil properties that influence the transportation of barium to\r\ngroundwater are cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content and\r\npH. In soil with a high cation exchange capacity (e.g., fine textured mineral\r\nsoils or soils with high organic matter content), barium mobility will be\r\nlimited by adsorption. High CaCO3 content limits mobility by precipitation of\r\nthe element as BaCO3. Barium will also precipitate as barium sulfate in the\r\npresence of sulfate ions. Barium is more mobile and is more likely to be\r\nleached from soils in the presence of chloride due to the high solubility of\r\nbarium chloride as compared to other chemical forms of barium. Barium may become\r\nmore mobile in soils under acid conditions as barium in water-insoluble salts,\r\nsuch as barium sulfate and carbonate, becomes more soluble. Barium complexes\r\nwith fatty acids (e.g., in acidic landfill leachate) will be much more mobile\r\nin the soil due to the lower charge of these complexes and subsequent reduction\r\nin adsorption capacity.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant.

This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Volatilisation of n-butyl acetate is expected from moist soil surfaces given its Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilisation from dry soil surfaces is expected based on a measured vapor pressure of 11.5 mm Hg. Using a standard BOD dilution technique and a sewage inoculum, theoretical BODs of 56 % to 86 % were observed during 5-20 day incubation periods, which suggests that n-butyl acetate may biodegrade in soil.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value indicates that n-butyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Butyl acetate is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on a Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 127, hours respectively. An estimated BCF value of 10 based on the log Kow, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using a filtered sewage seed, 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 58 % and 83 % were measured in freshwater dilution tests; 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 40 % and 61 % were measured in salt water. A 5-day theoretical BOD of 56.8 % and 51.8 % were measured for n-butyl acetate in distilled water and seawater, respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate for this compound based upon experimentally determined hydrolysis half-lives of 114 and 11 days at pH 8 and 9 respectively.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, n-butyl acetate, which has a vapour pressure of 11.5 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase n-butyl acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 4 days</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h, 23 C): island silverside (Menidia beryllina) 185 ppm (static bioassay in synthetic seawater, mild aeration applied after 24 h); bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 100 ppm (static bioassay in fresh water, mild aeration applied after 24 h)</p> <p>Fish EC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 18 mg/l (affected fish lost equilibrium prior to death)\u00a0</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (48 h): 44 ppm</p> <p>Algal LC50 (96 h): Scenedesmus 320 ppm</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p>"

                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>No exposure limits set by NOHSC or ACGIH</p> #CEL TWA: 50 ppm, 320 mg/m3  (as heptyl acetate)   [Manufacturer]",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
