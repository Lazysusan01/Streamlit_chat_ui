Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs.

Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Phenols may exhibit local anaesthetic properties and, in general, are central nervous system depressants at high concentrations. The dihydroxy derivatives act as simple phenols but their effects are largely limited to local irritation. Trihydroxy derivatives may reduce the oxygen content of blood at sufficient exposure levels. Methyl phenols (cresols) typically do not pose significant inhalation hazards due to relatively low vapour pressures and objectionable odours.

The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Degradation of APEs in wastewater\r\ntreatment plants or in the environment generates more persistent shorter-chain\r\nAPEs and alkylphenols (APs) such as nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and AP\r\nmono- to triethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2 and NPE3). There is concern that APE\r\nmetabolites (NP, OP, NPE1-3) can mimic natural hormones and that the levels\r\npresent in the environment may be sufficient to disrupt endocrine function in\r\nwildlife and humans. The physicochemical properties of the APE metabolites (NP,\r\nNPE1-4, OP, OPE1-4), in particular the high Kow values, indicate that they will\r\npartition effectively into sediments following discharge from STPs. The aqueous\r\nsolubility data for the APE metabolites indicate that the concentration in\r\nwater combined with the high partition coefficients will provide a significant\r\nreservoir (load) in various environmental compartments. Data from studies\r\nconducted in many regions across the world have shown significant levels in\r\nsamples of every environmental compartment examined. In the US, levels of NP in\r\nair ranged from 0.01 to 81 ng/m3, with seasonal trends observed. Concentrations\r\nof APE metabolites in treated wastewater effluents in the US ranged from &lt;\r\n0.1 to 369 ug/l, in Spain they were between 6 and 343 ug/l and concentrations\r\nup to 330 ug/l were found in the UK. Levels in sediments reflected the high\r\npartition coefficients with concentrations reported ranging from &lt; 0.1 to\r\n13,700 ug/kg for sediments in the US. Fish in the UK were found to contain up\r\nto 0.8 ug/kg NP in muscle tissue. APEs degraded faster in the water column than\r\nin sediment. Aerobic conditions facilitate easier further biotransformation of\r\nAPE metabolites than anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenols are susceptible to photochemical degradation. Using\r\nnatural, filtered, lake water it was found that nonylphenol had a half-life of\r\napproximately 10-15 h under continuous, noon, summer sun in the surface water\r\nlayer, with a rate approximately 1.5 times slower at depths 20-25 cm.\r\nPhotolysis was much slower with ethoxylated nonylphenol, and so it is unlikely\r\nto be a significant event in removal of the ethoxylates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols released to the\r\natmosphere will exist in the vapour phase and is thought to be degraded by\r\nreaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, with a calculated\r\nhalf-life, for nonylphenol, of 0.3 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Abiotic degradation of\r\nalkylphenol is negligible.

During\r\ndegradation ethylene oxide units are cleaved off the ethylene oxide chain until\r\nonly short-chain alkylphenol ethoxylates remain, typically mono- and diethylene\r\noxides. Oxidation of these oligomers creates the corresponding carboxylic acids.\r\nThis leaves several degradation products: short-chain ethoxylates, their\r\ncarboxylic acids, and alkylphenols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Alkylphenols are not\r\nreadily biodegradable. Several mechanisms of microbial aromatic ring\r\ndegradation have been reported, the most common being formation of catechol\r\nfrom phenol, followed by ring scission between or adjacent to the two hydroxyl\r\ngroups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The full breakdown pathway for APES has not yet been determined,\r\nand all studies have so far focused on identification of intermediates in\r\nbacterial culture media, rather than studying cell-free systems or purified\r\nenzymes. It is, however, likely that microbial metabolism usually starts by an\r\nattack on the ethoxylate chain, rather than on the ring or the hydrophobic\r\nchain. The ethoxylate groups are progressively removed, either by ether\r\ncleavage, or by terminal alcohol oxidation followed by cleavage of the\r\nresulting carboxylic acid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation of APEs produces less biodegradable products:\r\nalkylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylates, alkylphenoxy acetic and\r\nalkylphenoxypolyethoxy acetic acids, and alkylphenols. These metabolites\r\nfrequently persist through sewage treatment and in rivers. Anaerobic conditions\r\ngenerally lead to the accumulation of alkylphenols. The rate of biodegradation\r\nseems to decrease with increasing length of the ethylene oxide chain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Metabolites of APES\r\naccumulate in organisms, with bioconcentration factors varying from ten to\r\nseveral thousand, depending on species, metabolite and organ.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The metabolites of APES are generally more toxic than the original\r\ncompounds. APES have LC50s above about 1.5 mg/l, whereas alkylphenols,such as\r\nnonylphenol, have LC50s are generally around 0.1 mg/l.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Oestrogenic activity:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The role\r\nof alkyl chain length and branching, substituent position, number of alkylated\r\ngroups, and the requirement of a phenolic ring structure was assessed in fish.\r\nThe results showed that most alkylphenols were oestrogenic, although with 3-300\r\nthousand times lower potency than the endogenous estrogen 17beta-estradiol.\r\nMono-substituted tertiary alkylphenols with moderate (C4-C5) and long alkyl\r\nchain length (C8-C9) in the para position exhibited the highest oestrogenic\r\npotency. Substitution with multiple alkyl groups, presence of substituents in\r\nthe ortho- and meta-position and lack of a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring\r\nreduced the oestrogenic activity, although several oestrogenic alkylated\r\nnon-phenolics were identified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Human exposure:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols were first\r\nfound to be oestrogenic (oestrogen-mimicking) in the 1930s, but more recent\r\nresearch has highlighted the implications of these effects. The growth of\r\ncultured human breast cancer cells is affected by nonylphenol at concentrations\r\nas low as 1 uM (220 ug/ l) or concentrations of octylphenol as low as 0.1 uM\r\n(20 ug/1). Oestrogenic effects have also been shown on rainbow trout\r\nhepatocytes, chicken embryo fibroblasts and a mouse oestrogen receptor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The insecticide chlordecone (Kepone) shows similar behaviour to\r\nalkylphenols, accumulating in liver and adipose tissue, and eliciting\r\noestrogenic activity. Workers exposed to this insecticide can suffer\r\nreproductive effects such as low sperm counts and sterility. In addition, the\r\noestrogenic effects of chlordecone on MCF7 cells occur at similar concentrations\r\nto those of alkylphenols, suggesting that alkylphenols will be a similar health\r\nhazard if target cells are exposed to uM levels of these compounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">By comparing environmental concentrations, bioconcentration\r\nfactors and\u00a0<i>in vitro\u00a0</i>oestrogenic effect levels, current\r\nenvironmental levels of alkylphenolic compounds are probably high enough to\r\naffect the hormonal control systems of some organisms. It is also possible that\r\nhuman health could be being affected.</span></p> <p>Environmental toxicity is a function of the n-octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Pow, log Kow). Phenols with log Pow &gt;7.4 are expected to exhibit low toxicity to aquatic organisms. However the toxicity of phenols with a lower log Pow is variable, ranging from low toxicity (LC50 values &gt;100 mg/l) to highly toxic (LC50 values &lt;1 mg/l) dependent on log Pow, molecular weight and substitutions on the aromatic ring. Dinitrophenols are more toxic than predicted from QSAR estimates.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p> <p>The alkyl phenolics (which may occur as breakdown products of some polyethoxylated surfactants) have been implicated in a phenomenon which has apparently occurred since the mid 1960s, namely lower sperm counts and reduced fertility in males. Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p>",

Volatilisation of\r\nmethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process\r\ngiven a Henry's Law constant of 4.55x10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for\r\nvolatilisation of methanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon a vapor\r\npressure of 127 mm Hg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate\r\nprocess for methanol based on half-lives of 1 and 3.2 days measured in a sandy\r\nsilt loam and sandy loam from Texas and Mississippi, respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">AQUATIC FATE: The estimated Koc indicates that methanol is not\r\nexpected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water\r\nsurfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law\r\nconstant estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake\r\nare 3 and 35 days, respectively. A BCF of less than 10 measured in fish, suggests\r\nbioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in\r\nsunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate\r\nprocess for methanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse\r\nor absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Methanol has been\r\nshown to undergo rapid biodegradation in a variety of screening studies using\r\nsewage seed and activated sludge inoculum, which suggests that biodegradation\r\nwill occur in aquatic environments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle\r\npartitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour\r\npressure, methanol is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient\r\natmosphere. Vapour-phase methanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction\r\nwith photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this\r\nreaction in air is estimated to be 17 days, calculated from its rate constant\r\nof 9.4x10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h) fathead minnow\u00a0<i>(Pimephales promelus)</i>\u00a029000\r\nmg/l; rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhyncus mykiss</i>) 19000 mg/l; bluegill (<i>Lepomis\r\nmacrochirus</i>) 15400 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (7 d): guppy 10860 mg/l (14 d): 11.5 mg/l (semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia pulex LC50 (18 h): 19500 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brine shrimp (<i>Artemia salina</i>) LC50 24 h): 1101.46-1578.84\r\nmg/l (static)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brown shrimp (<i>Crangon crangon</i>) LC50 (96 h): 1340 mg/l\r\n(semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) LC50 (96 h): 15900 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Marine bacterium (<i>Photobacterium posphoreum</i>) LC50 (4 h):\r\n7690 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Protozoa (<i>Tetrahymena pyriformis</i>) LC50 (48 h) 18756 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "Environment": "<p>When ethanol is released into the soil it readily and quickly biodegrades but may leach into ground water; most is lost by evaporation. When released into water the material readily evaporates and is biodegradable.</p> <p>Ethanol does not bioaccumulate to an appreciable extent.</p> <p>The material is readily degraded by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxy radicals; release into air will result in photodegradation and wet deposition.</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p>TERRESTRIAL FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of ethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. The potential for volatilisation of ethanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mmHg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for ethanol based on half-lives on the order of a few days for ethanol in sandy soil/groundwater microcosms.</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method, volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 39 days, respectively.An estimated BCF= 3, from a log Kow of -0.31 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in sunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for ethanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse or absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Ethanol was degraded with half-lives on the order of a few days in aquatic studies conducted using microcosms constructed with a low organic sandy soil and groundwater, indicating it is unlikely to be persistent in aquatic environments(8).\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: Ethanol, which has an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase ethanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days, calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-12 m3/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>log Kow: -0.31- -0.32</p> <p>Half-life (hr) air: 144</p> <p>Half-life (hr) H2O surface water: 144</p> <p>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 6.29E-06</p> <p>BOD 5 if unstated: 0.93-1.67,63%</p> <p>COD: 1.99-2.11,97%</p> <p>ThOD: 2.1</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For ethanol:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 49-716 ppm (detection), 101 ppm (recognition)</p> <p>Eye and respiratory tract irritation do not appear to occur at exposure levels of less than 5000 ppm and the TLV-TWA is thought to provide an adequate margin of safety against such effects. Experiments in man show that inhalation of 1000 ppm caused slight symptoms of poisoning and 5000 ppm caused strong stupor and morbid sleepiness. Subjects exposed to 5000 ppm to 10000 ppm experienced smarting of the eyes and nose and coughing. Symptoms disappeared within minutes. Inhalation also causes local irritating effects to the eyes and upper respiratory tract, headaches, sensation of heat intraocular tension, stupor, fatigue and a need to sleep. At 15000 ppm there was continuous lachrymation and coughing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL). In addition the US EPA's procedures for risk assessment for hazard identification and dose-response assessment as applied by NIOSH were used in the creation of such limits. Uncertainty factors (UFs) have also been incorporated.</p> <p>These exposure guidelines have been derived from a screening level of risk assessment and should not be construed as unequivocally safe limits.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The most common signs of inhalation overexposure to ethanol, in animals, include ataxia, incoordination and drowsiness for those surviving narcosis.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Liver lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase aaand cathepsin) and superoxide dismutase activities were also increased.

There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male and female F344/N rats or B6C3F1 male mice exposed to 750, 1500 or 3000 ppm.</p>\n<p>NTP Technical Report Series No. 495, May 2001</p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, nitrites can react with secondary amines, either alone or in biological systems, to form carcinogenic nitrosamines.</p>\n<p>Sodium nitrite (60 mg/kg) administered in drinking water to pregnant guinea pigs produced maternal anaemia and increased the incidences of abortion and foetal mortality. Administration of 2000-3000 mg/l sodium nitrite in drinking water, to pregnant rats, produced 30-53% foetal mortality. In rat dams given 0.025-0.5% in feed, sodium nitrite caused an increase in foetal and pup mortality and decreases in pre-weanling body weights.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p> <p>CARE: Explosive vapour air mixtures may be present on opening vessels which have contained liquid ammonia.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce toxic effects.</p> <p>The highly irritant properties of ammonia vapour result as the gas dissolves in mucous fluids and forms irritant, even corrosive solutions.</p> <p>Inhalation of the ammonia fumes causes coughing, vomiting, reddening of lips, mouth, nose, throat and conjunctiva while higher concentrations can cause temporary blindness, restlessness, tightness in the chest, pulmonary oedema (lung damage), weak pulse and cyanosis.</p> <p>Inhalation of high concentrations of vapour may cause breathing difficulty, tightness in chest, pulmonary oedema and lung damage. Brief exposure to high concentrations &gt; 5000 ppm may cause death due to asphyxiation (suffocation) or fluid in the lungs.</p> <p>Prolonged or regular minor exposure to the vapour may cause persistent irritation of the eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract. Massive ammonia exposures may produce chronic airway hyperactivity and asthma with associated pulmonary function changes. The average nasal retention of ammonia by human subjects was found to be 83%.</p> <p>If exposure to highly concentrated vapour atmosphere is prolonged this may lead to narcosis, unconsciousness, even coma and unless resuscitated - death.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing. Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p>",

Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The vapour when concentrated has pronounced eye irritation effects and this gives some warning of high vapour concentrations. If eye irritation occurs seek to reduce exposure with available control measures, or evacuate area.</p> <p>Direct contact with alkaline corrosives may produce pain and burns. Oedema, destruction of the epithelium, corneal opacification and iritis may occur. In less severe cases these symptoms tend to resolve. In severe injuries the full extent of the damage may not be immediately apparent with late complications comprising a persistent oedema, vascularisation and corneal scarring, permanent opacity, staphyloma, cataract, symblepharon and loss of sight.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to produce harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives using animal models). Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Mild irritation is produced on moist skin when vapour concentrations of ammonia exceed 10000 ppm. High vapour concentrations (&gt;30000 ppm) or direct contact with solutions produces severe pain, a stinging sensation, burns and vesiculation and possible brown stains. Extensive burning may be fatal. Vapour exposure may, rarely, produce urticaria.</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Skin contact with alkaline corrosives may produce severe pain and burns; brownish stains may develop.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Human metabolism allows detoxification of ammonia, however toxic effects appear if this mechanism is overwhelmed by other than small doses.\u00a0</p> <p>Ingestion of ammonium salts may produce local irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Very large doses of ammonium salts may produce a drop in blood pressure, collapse, central nervous system disorders, spasms, narcosis, respiratory paralysis and haemolysis.</p> <p>Large doses of ammonium salts may be sufficiently absorbed to produce diuresis and systemic ammonia poisoning. Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated minor exposure to ammonia gas/vapour may cause long-term irritation to the eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract. Repeated exposure or prolonged contact may produce dermatitis, and conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Other effects may include ulcerative changes to the mouth and bronchial and gastrointestinal disturbances. Adaptation to usually irritating concentrations may result in tolerance. In animals, repeated exposures to sub-lethal levels produces adverse effects on the respiratory tract, liver, kidneys and spleen. Exposure at 675 ppm for several weeks produced eye irritation in dogs and rabbits; corneal opacity, covering between a quarter to one half of the total surface area, was evident in rabbits.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

                "HandlingProcedure": "<p><br /></p> <p>Natural gases contain a contaminant, radon-222, a naturally occurring radioactive gas. During subsequent processing, radon tends to concentrate in liquefied petroleum streams and in product streams having similar boiling points. Industry experience indicates that the commercial product may contain small amounts of radon-222 and its radioactive decay products (radon daughters). The actual concentration of radon-222 and radioactive daughters in process equipment (IE lines, filters, pumps and reactor units) may reach significant levels and produce potentially damaging levels of gamma radiation. A potential external radiation hazard exists at or near any pipe, valve or vessel containing a radon enriched stream or containing internal deposits of radioactive material. Field studies, however, have not shown that conditions exist that expose the worker to cumulative exposures in excess of general population limits. Equipment containing gamma-emitting decay products should be presumed to be internally contaminated with alpha-emitting decay products which may be hazardous if inhaled or ingested. During maintenance operations that require the opening of contaminated process equipment, the flow of gas should be stopped and a four hour delay enforced to allow gamma-radiation to drop to background levels. Protective equipment (including high efficiency particulate respirators (P3) suitable for radionucleotides or supplied air) should be worn by personnel entering a vessel or working on contaminated process equipment to prevent skin contamination or inhalation of any residue containing alpha-radiation.

                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>For petroleum distillates:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental fate:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>When petroleum substances are\nreleased into the environment, four major fate processes will take place:\ndissolution in water, volatilization, biodegradation and adsorption.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Hydrocarbons may sensitise the heart to adrenalin and other circulatory catecholamines; as a result cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation may occur. Abrupt collapse may produce traumatic injury. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may be evident early. Symptoms of moderate poisoning may include giddiness, headache, dizziness and nausea. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Not normally a hazard due to physical form of product.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments\u00a0</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
