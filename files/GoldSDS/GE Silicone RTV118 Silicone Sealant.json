                "Use": "<p>Siloxanes, the building blocks for silicone products, are widely used chemicals. The siloxanes are characterised by a high stability, physiologic inertness and good release and lubricating properties.</p> <p>Siloxanes are chemical compounds with a backbone of alternating silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms, each silicon atom bearing one or several organic groups. Siloxanes are building blocks for silicone products or make part of other products, such as cosmetics or paint. In colloquial language the term silicones is often used synonymously with siloxanes.</p> <p>The chemical names of the compounds most often include the string \"siloxane\", but in particular in cosmetics and toiletries names including methicone are used instead, e.g. dimethicone derived from dimethyl silicone; synonymous with dimethylsiloxane. Another used synonym is poly(oxy(methylsilylene)). To add to the confusion about the terms, several</p> <p>of the compounds are designated \"silicones and siloxanes\".</p> <p>The properties of the siloxanes and the silicone products depend on the length of the Si-O backbone, the chemical groups attached to the backbone and the presence of cross-links between the backbones.\u00a0</p> <p>The silicon and oxygen atoms may be linked into cyclic or linear structures, and are described as\u00a0<i>linear siloxanes\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>cyclic siloxanes</i>. The shorter linear polysiloxanes are, like some of the cyclic siloxanes, volatile.</p> <p>In linear siloxanes the end groups determine the use of the polymer. Typical end groups are methyl, hydroxyl, vinyl or hydrogen. For example vinyl- and hydroxyterminated polysiloxanes find major application in silicone elastomers. The side groups determine together with the end-groups the properties of the siloxanes. Phenyl side groups provide e.g. oxidative stability. Aminopropyl and polyether side groups provide water solubility, whereas the presence of alkyl groups enhances water repellency and lubricity. The presence of halogens in the side chains produces very stable polymers. Very high resistance to solvents can be obtained by using trifluoropropyl side chains, whereas lubricity at high temperatures is obtained by tetrachlorophenyl side groups\u00a0</p> <p>Silicone products are grouped into silicone fluids, elastomers and resins depending on the length of the backbone, the extent of crosslinking and the type and number of organic groups attached to the silicon atoms. Silicone fluids are used for a wide range of applications, silicone elastomers are mainly used for sealants and rubbers, and resins are mainly used for paints. The most common siloxanes are polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with different modifications.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also\r\nknown as dimethylpolysiloxane or dimethicone, belongs to a group of polymeric\r\norganosilicon compounds that are commonly referred to as silicones.\u00a0 PDMS is\r\nthe most widely used silicon-based organic polymer, and is particularly known\r\nfor its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. PDMS is optically clear, and,\r\nin general, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable. It is one of several types of\r\nsilicone oil (polymerized siloxane). Its applications range from contact lenses\r\nand medical devices to elastomers; it is also present in shampoos (as\r\ndimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), caulking,\r\nlubricants and heat-resistant tiles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">PDMS is hydrophobic\u00a0 The addition\r\nof silanol (SiOH) by oxidation, renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing\r\nwater to wet it. The surface can be further functionalized by reaction with\r\ntrichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface's\r\nhydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is\r\nvacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minute.</span></p> <p>Silicones generally increase in viscosity with increasing chain length. In silicone fluids, the number of dimethylsiloxane moieties (indicated by the \"n\" in the chemical formulae) is up to 4000 .</p> <p>Silicone fluids are distinguished from common organic fluids by a number of unique properties :</p> <ul> <li>Good thermal stability (150-200 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Good low-temperature performance (&lt;-70 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Strong hydrophobicity;\u00a0</li> <li>Excellent release properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Antifriction and lubricating properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Pronounced surface activity;\u00a0</li> <li>Good dielectric properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Very good damping behaviour;\u00a0</li> <li>Good radiation resistance;\u00a0</li> <li>High solubility of gases;\u00a0</li> <li>Physiological inertness;\u00a0</li> <li>Low temperature dependence of physical properties.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Because of these properties silicone fluids are widely applied as release agents for moulding operations, medical and cosmetic applications, polishes, coolants and dielectric fluids for electrical systems, metal processing fluids and agents for foam control. The silicone fluid may be formulated into emulsions, dispersions, greases and compounds.</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in specific circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or irritation of the respiratory tract (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The low vapour pressure of silicone fluids make exposures to potentially harmful vapours unlikely. The vapours of a low molecular weight member of this family, hexamethyldisiloxane, were tolerated by guinea pigs at concentrations of 25000 ppm for 30 minutes without apparent ill-effect. Higher saturated vapour concentrations (39000-40000 ppm) produced death in 15-20 minutes; deaths appeared to occur as a result of respiratory failure as animals removed from exposure, prior to death, almost always survived. Although animal studies show that silicone fluids are removed very slowly from the lungs, their presence is not expected to produce adverse effects; exposure to aerosols is unlikely to result in damage to the health. When heated at high temperatures, the fumes and oxidation products of methyl silicones can be both irritating and produce toxic effects following inhalation. Massive exposures of heated silicone oil can produce central nervous system depression leading to death.</p> <p>Not normally a hazard due to non-volatile nature of product</p>",

Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>When the eyes of human subjects where exposed to silicone fluids, there was evidence of transitory conjunctival irritation within a few hours; this resolved within 24 hours. When applied to the eyes of rabbits, silicone fluids produced transitory irritation which lasted no longer than 48 hours. Injection into the various structures of the eye of animals produced corneal scarring, degenerative changes in the retina, foreign body reaction and cataracts.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Low molecular weight silicone fluids may exhibit solvent action and may produce skin irritation.</p> <p>Excessive use or prolonged contact may lead to defatting, drying and irritation of sensitive skin</p>",

Aspiration of silicone fluids or emulsions may produce chemical pneumonitis.</p> <p>High molecular weight material; on single acute exposure would be expected to pass through gastrointestinal tract with little change / absorption.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Base material for high temperature mortars.|<p>Synthetic amorphous (non-crystalline) silica (SAS) can be divided into two groups according to whether the manufacturing process is by the wet route (precipitated silica, silica gel) or the thermal route (pyrogenic silica). Colloidal silicas (silica sols) are stable dispersions of SASs in a liquid, usually water. Furthermore, SASs, which are generally hydrophilic, may be rendered hydrophobic by surface treatment. SASs exist as highly pure, white, fluffy powders or milky-white dispersions of these powders in fluids (usually water).</p> <p>A significant proportion of the global production of SAS is rendered hydrophobic by surface modification mainly with Si-organic compounds. Surface modified (after-treated) SAS can be obtained either by physical or chemical reaction. The most common Si-organic compounds used for the treatment are hexamethyldisilazane (CAS No. 999-97-3), dimethyldichlorsilane (CAS No. 75-78-5) and polydimethylsiloxanes (e.g. CAS No. 9016-00-6). The first compound forms mono-functional moieties upon hydrolysis [(Si-O-Si(CH3)3], whereas the latter two give rise to bi-functional units [Si-O-[Si(CH3)2-O]x].\u00a0The surface treatment does not change the solid properties e.g. particle size, dissolution kinetics of the inorganic polymer silicon dioxide (silica, SiO2). However, surface treatment does alter physico-chemical properties, e.g. reduced moisture uptake.</p>",

Indeed, once\r\nreleased and dissolved into the environment no distinction can be made between\r\nthe initial forms of silica. At normal environmental pH, dissolved silica\r\nexists exclusively as monosilicic acid [Si(OH)4]. At pH 9.4 the solubility of\r\namorphous silica is about 120 mg SiO2/l . Quartz has a solubility of only 6\r\nmg/l, but its rate of dissolution is so slow at ordinary temperature and\r\npressure that the solubility of amorphous silica represents the upper limit of\r\ndissolved silica concentration in natural waters. Moreover, silicic acid is the\r\nbioavailable form for aquatic organisms and it plays an important role in the\r\nbiogeochemical cycle of Si, particularly in the oceans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>In the oceans, the transfer of dissolved silica from the marine\r\nhydrosphere to the biosphere initiates the global biological silicon cycle.\r\nMarine organisms such as diatoms, silicoflagellates and radiolarians build up\r\ntheir skeletons by taking up silicic acid from seawater. After these organisms\r\ndie, the biogenic silica accumulated in them partly dissolves. The portion of\r\nthe biogenic silica that does not dissolve settles and ultimately reaches the\r\nsediment. The transformation of opal (amorphous biogenic silica) deposits in\r\nsediments through diagenetic processes allows silica to re-enter the geological\r\ncycle.

Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p> <p>Repeated exposure to synthetic amorphous silicas may produce skin dryness and cracking.</p> <p>\u00a0Available data confirm the absence of significant toxicity by oral and dermal routes of exposure.</p> <p>Numerous repeated-dose, subchronic and chronic inhalation toxicity studies have been conducted in a number of species, at airborne concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3. Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

                "Use": "<p>Siloxanes, the building blocks for silicone products, are widely used chemicals. The siloxanes are characterised by a high stability, physiologic inertness and good release and lubricating properties.</p> <p>Siloxanes are chemical compounds with a backbone of alternating silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms, each silicon atom bearing one or several organic groups. Siloxanes are building blocks for silicone products or make part of other products, such as cosmetics or paint. In colloquial language the term silicones is often used synonymously with siloxanes.</p> <p>The chemical names of the compounds most often include the string \"siloxane\", but in particular in cosmetics and toiletries names including methicone are used instead, e.g. dimethicone derived from dimethyl silicone; synonymous with dimethylsiloxane. Another used synonym is poly(oxy(methylsilylene)). To add to the confusion about the terms, several</p> <p>of the compounds are designated \"silicones and siloxanes\".</p> <p>The properties of the siloxanes and the silicone products depend on the length of the Si-O backbone, the chemical groups attached to the backbone and the presence of cross-links between the backbones.\u00a0</p> <p>The silicon and oxygen atoms may be linked into cyclic or linear structures, and are described as\u00a0<i>linear siloxanes\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>cyclic siloxanes</i>. The shorter linear polysiloxanes are, like some of the cyclic siloxanes, volatile.</p> <p>In linear siloxanes the end groups determine the use of the polymer. Typical end groups are methyl, hydroxyl, vinyl or hydrogen. For example vinyl- and hydroxyterminated polysiloxanes find major application in silicone elastomers. The side groups determine together with the end-groups the properties of the siloxanes. Phenyl side groups provide e.g. oxidative stability. Aminopropyl and polyether side groups provide water solubility, whereas the presence of alkyl groups enhances water repellency and lubricity. The presence of halogens in the side chains produces very stable polymers. Very high resistance to solvents can be obtained by using trifluoropropyl side chains, whereas lubricity at high temperatures is obtained by tetrachlorophenyl side groups\u00a0</p> <p>Silicone products are grouped into silicone fluids, elastomers and resins depending on the length of the backbone, the extent of crosslinking and the type and number of organic groups attached to the silicon atoms. Silicone fluids are used for a wide range of applications, silicone elastomers are mainly used for sealants and rubbers, and resins are mainly used for paints. The most common siloxanes are polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with different modifications.</p> <p>Silicones generally increase in viscosity with increasing chain length. In silicone fluids, the number of dimethylsiloxane moieties (indicated by the \"n\" in the chemical formulae) is up to 4000 .</p> <p>Silicone fluids are distinguished from common organic fluids by a number of unique properties :</p> <ul> <li>Good thermal stability (150-200 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Good low-temperature performance (&lt;-70 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Strong hydrophobicity;\u00a0</li> <li>Excellent release properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Antifriction and lubricating properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Pronounced surface activity;\u00a0</li> <li>Good dielectric properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Very good damping behaviour;\u00a0</li> <li>Good radiation resistance;\u00a0</li> <li>High solubility of gases;\u00a0</li> <li>Physiological inertness;\u00a0</li> <li>Low temperature dependence of physical properties.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Because of these properties silicone fluids are widely applied as release agents for moulding operations, medical and cosmetic applications, polishes, coolants and dielectric fluids for electrical systems, metal processing fluids and agents for foam control. The silicone fluid may be formulated into emulsions, dispersions, greases and compounds.</p>",

Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Inhalation of quantities of liquid mist may be extremely hazardous, even lethal due to spasm, extreme irritation of larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Signs of tert-butanol intoxication in animals exposed to the vapour include ataxia and narcosis</p>",

Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p>",

This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>The potency of tert-butanol intoxication is approximately 1.5 times that produced by ethanol.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

                "Environment": "<p>For methyltriacetoxysilane:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>\u00a0The melting point of methyltriacetoxysilane is 41 deg C and the boiling point is 220 deg C at 1013 hPa. The vapor pressure is 0.26 hPa at 20 deg C. The estimated water solubility of methyltriacetoxysilane is 91 g/L; the estimated log Kow is 0.25. The water solubility and log Kow values may not be reliable because the chemical is hydrolytically unstable. The atmospheric half-life based only on photodegradation (i.e., reaction with hydroxyl radical) is 58 days. The atmospheric half-life based on photodegradation and hydrolysis is &lt;2 min. However, photodegradation as a mode of removal is unlikely because methyltriacetoxysilane is highly reactive and hydrolytically unstable, such that acetic acid and methylsilanetriol are rapidly generated upon contact with water or water vapor. Consequently, reaction with water vapor is likely the predominant degradation process for methyltriacetoxysilane in air. The vapor pressure indicates that methyltriacetoxysilane resides in the atmosphere and may undergo photodegradation due to ozone and/or hydroxyl radicals. Due to the very fast hydrolysis, the substance is not expected to reside in air and vapor pressure of the substance may not be relevant.</p> <p>Methyltriacetoxysilane is hydrolytically unstable over a range of environmentally relevant pH and temperature conditions. At pH 7, the half-life is = &lt;12 seconds. Rapid hydrolysis of this material produces acetic acid and trisilanols.</p> <p>Methyltriacetoxysilane is likely to be readily biodegradable based on results with a close structural analog, ethyltriacetoxysilane; however these materials rapidly hydrolyse and generate 3 moles of acetic acid for every mole of parent material. Thus, the biodegradation observed is likely reflective of the hydrolysis product, acetic acid. The biodegradation rate for acetic acid after 14 days under aerobic conditions is 74%. Bioaccumulation is not anticipated since this material is hydrolytically unstable.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute aquatic toxicity studies are available from two structural analogs, ethyltriacetoxysilane, and vinyltriacetoxysilane, as well as the primary hydrolysis product, acetic acid. The 96-hour LC50 of ethyltriacetoxysilane for\u00a0<i>Brachydanio rerio\u00a0</i>is 251 mg/L (the test media was not neutralized). The 96-hour LC50 of vinyltriacetoxysilane for\u00a0<i>Oncorhyncus mykiss\u00a0</i>is 51 mg/L and for\u00a0<i>Lepomis macrochirus\u00a0</i>is 68 mg/L (in both cases the test media was not neutralised). The 72 hour LC50s for acetic acid are 75, 79-88 (pH &lt;5.9) and 251 mg/L (several species of fish). The 48 hour EC50 of ethyltriacetoxysilane is 62 mg/L for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>. The 48 hour EC50 of vinyltriacetoxysilane is 100 mg/L for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna\u00a0</i>(the test media was not neutralised).</p> <p>Under static conditions, the 48 hour EC50 value for acetic acid is 65 mg/L for aquatic invertebrates (the test media was not neutralised). When the test solutions are neutralised, the static 48 hour EC50 for acetic acid is 6000 mg/L. In renewal systems with aquatic invertebrates, 48 hour EC50s for acetic acid are 100 mg/L and 180 mg/L. Ethyltriacetoxysilane toxicity to\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus\u00a0</i>provided a 72 hour EC50 of 73 and 76 mg/L for biomass and growth rate, respectively (the test media was not neutralized). When results are expressed on the basis of the amount of acetic acid generated from the hydrolysis reaction, the toxicity of the parent material is comparable to the reported toxicity of acetic acid (EC50\u00a0= 50-450 mg/L, depending on test species). Studies have been performed with a silanol monomer, trimethylsilanol (CAS No. 1066-40-6). Although this silanol is not expected to be produced following hydrolysis of methyltriacetoxysilane. A semistatic 96h study with trimethylsilanol and rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) resulted in a No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) of 128 mg/L and an LC50\u00a0of 271 mg/L.</p> <p>Methyltriacetoxysilane undergoes rapid hydrolysis in moist/aqueous environments (t1/2 is less than 12 seconds) to acetic acid and the corresponding trisilanols, thus observed toxicity is likely due primarily to acetic acid. Abiotic hydrolysis products undergo continuous, condensation reactions to produce higher molecular weight cyclic and linear siloxanes (the number-average and weight-average molecular weights (MW) were determined to be 1247 and 6208, respectively, with 69% of the chromatogram represented by a MW range higher than 1000 at the 1-hr reaction time; at the 4-hr reaction time, the number-average and weight-average molecular weights increased to 1629 and 152600 with 77% of the chromatogram higher than 1000 molecular weight, respectively). The polymerisation products are not volatile and are in a molecular weight range large enough to be considered biologically unavailable</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Acetic acid and its salts (the acetates) can be grouped together\r\nbecause of their close structural relationships, their natural occurrence in\r\nplants and animals, and their fundamental role in cell metabolism, particularly\r\nin the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the citric acid or Kreb\u2019s\r\ncycle), which is where humans get their energy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n <li class=\"MsoNormal\" style='color:black;line-height:normal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\"'>Acetic acid is\r\n     degraded photochemically in the atmosphere to produce hydroxyl radicals\r\n     (estimated typical half-life of 22 days).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of quantities of liquid mist may be extremely hazardous, even lethal due to spasm, extreme irritation of larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema.</p>",

Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage.

Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw.

These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

It is\r\nexpected to partition to air by volatilization and to sediments and soil by\r\nadsorption when released to surface water or terrestrial environments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">OMCT is persistent in air, water and sediment, and has a high\r\npotential to accumulate in aquatic organisms. OMCT is also judged to behave\r\nlike a persistent organic pollutant (POP) and have the potential to travel to\r\nthe Arctic. In addition, the experimental toxicity data show that the substance\r\ncan cause long-term toxicity to aquatic organisms at low concentrations in\r\nwater. OMCT meets criteria for persistence and bioaccumulation potential as set\r\nout in the Canadian\u00a0<i>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</i></span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0 Based on the mass flow\r\ntool \u00a0the environmental release of OMCT is mainly to air (~13%). A vapour\r\npressure of 132-157.3 Pa and a Henry's Law constant of 9119 - 60 060 Pa\u00b7m3/mole\r\nas well as a long half-life in air indicates that 100% of the mass fraction released\r\nto air will remain there. Level III results also point out that most (~85%) of\r\nthe mass fraction residing in air from an emission to air will be transported\r\nout of the \"unit world\" (given the long half-life in air) and\r\ntherefore undergo long-range transport.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The results of environmental fate modelling yield a characteristic\r\ntravel distance of approximately 8000 km, strongly suggest the possibility that\r\nlong-range atmospheric transport including transcontinental and\r\nintercontinental movement</span><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Level III fugacity model indicate that OMCT, when released to air,\r\nwill remain in air, where it is expected to be slowly oxidized by the gas-phase\r\nreaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The empirically\r\nderived half-life for OMCT in the gas-phase hydroxyl radical reaction is 10.6\r\ndays. This is based on an experimental reaction rate of 1.01 \u00d7 10-12 cm3/mol.\r\nsec, which may be converted to an estimated half-life of 10.6 days, assuming\r\nfirst-order kinetics, a 12-hour day, and 1.5 \u00d7 10+6 OH/cm3. OMCT is not\r\nexpected to react, or react appreciably, with other photo-oxidative species in\r\nthe atmosphere, such as O3, nor is it likely to degrade via direct photolysis .\r\nTherefore, it is expected that reactions with hydroxyl radicals will be the\r\nmost important fate process in the atmosphere for this substance. The AOPWIN\r\n(2000) model also provides evidence supporting the persistence potential of\r\nthis substance, with a predicted atmospheric oxidation half-life of ~9 days.\r\nThus, the data demonstrate that this substance is persistent in air (half-life\r\n&gt; 2 days).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">When OMCT is released to water it\r\nis expected to adsorb to suspended solids, such as sewage sludge and sediments,\r\nbased on its log Koc value of ~4.5. Results of the Level III simulation for\r\nrelease to water show that approximately 62% will reside in the solid phase\r\n(suspended sediment and bed sediments) and 32% will reside in the aqueous phase\r\n(water column) because the log Koc for the compound is in the moderate sorption\r\nrange. Volatilisation from water surfaces might also be expected based upon the\r\nair-water partition coefficient (Kaw ); however,OMCT adsorptivity to solids\r\nreduces the influence of Kaw and thus reduces the mass fraction expected to\r\npartition to air from volatilisation at 25 C (i.e., ~6%).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The lack of fast biotic and abiotic degradation of OMCT under\r\nexpected environmental conditions will result in a half-life in water of t1/2\r\n&gt; 182 days and in sediment of t1/2 &gt; 365 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Soil:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">When OMCT is released to soil\r\nthrough, for example, applications of sewage sludge on moist agriculture soils,\r\napproximately 9% of the mass fraction will partition to air due to the high Kaw\r\nof OMCT and long half-life in air. However, the majority (~91%) will remain in\r\nsoil associated with solids for the same reasons described for sediment. The\r\nLevel III model may underestimate the mass transferred to air from moist soils,\r\nas it has been experimentally demonstrated this pathway to be a major loss\r\nprocess of cyclic siloxanes from soil. On dry soil, OMCT will quickly hydrolyse\r\nby clay minerals in soil to form dimethylsilanediol as the final breakdown\r\nsubstance. Abiotic reactions such as surface-acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of\r\npolydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), a polymer based on siloxane bonds of\r\ncyclosiloxanes have been demonstrated. Based on the available empirical studies\r\nthat show the potential for rapid clay-catalysed hydrolysis in surface soils,\r\nOMCT is not considered persistent in soil according to the criterion of t1/2\r\n&gt;182 days</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Biodegradation:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">OMCT is\r\nnot likely to be biodegraded in water.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> #CEL TWA: 5 ppm, 60 mg/m3                                [GE Silicones]#CEL TWA: 10 ppm, 120 mg/m3                              [Dow Corning]",

The critical effect level for repeated-dose toxicity via inhalation is considered to be 420 mg/m3, based not only on increased liver weights, but also on effects observed in other organs (adrenals, thymus, lungs) in a three-month rat inhalation study. Comparison of the critical effect level for repeated dose effects via inhalation (420 mg/m3) and the conservative upper-bounding exposure estimate via inhalation for OMCT results in an adequate margin of exposure. The critical effect level for repeated-dose toxicity via the oral route is considered to be 100 mg/kg-bw/day, based on decreased serum oestradiol in 7-day mouse studies and decreased body-weights and relative liver weights in foetuses in 8-day rat studies (OMCT administered to pregnant females).

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates.

Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia.

Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function).
