Limited environmental fate data also support the grouping of bitumens/ \u00a0asphalts under one category. Bitumen/ asphalts contain complex hydrocarbon mixtures with molecular weights ranging from 500-2000 and carbon numbers predominantly higher than C25, vapor pressures are negligible. The high molecular weights and similar hydrocarbon distributions among the bitumens/ asphalts support the conclusion that the toxicity of this group, in general, is not expected to vary significantly across members.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Upon release to the environment, bitumens/ asphalts are expected to distribute similarly because of their low volatility and limited water solubility. Bitumen/ asphalts are expected to be resistant to biodegradation, and those components that are soluble in water are expected to be resistant to hydrolysis. When bitumen/ asphalts are heated to facilitate paving or roofing applications, the lighter, more volatile components are distilled into the atmosphere. They condense as they cool, forming small droplets of liquid known as bitumen or asphalt fume condensate. The majority of hydrocarbons in bitumen/ asphalts are not susceptible to direct photolysis, since they do not have functional groups that absorb sunlight greater than 290 nm. However, certain aromatic and unsaturated compound members have the potential to undergo photolysis because they absorb light in the environmental UV region. Since bitumens/ asphalts contain high molecular weight hydrocarbons, partitioning to the atmosphere is not considered to be \u00a0important.\u00a0</p> <p>When compositionally analysing bitumens/ asphalts for certain toxicity endpoints the percentage of 3- to 7-ring polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is important. The levels of 3- to 7-ring PAHs are expected to be low considering the processes used to manufacture these substances.. Fumes generated experimentally at high temperatures are more likely to contain carcinogenic PAHs than fumes generated at the lower temperatures usually seen in field samples. Therefore, generating conditions are expected to significantly affect toxicity. .</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Bitumens/ asphalts by analogy with other high molecular weight hydrocarbons are not likely to show adverse acute or chronic ecological effects in aquatic species.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For hydrocarbons:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The lower molecular weight hydrocarbons are expected to form a\r\n&quot;slick&quot; on the surface of waters after release in calm sea\r\nconditions.

In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur. Manganese compound found in these soils\r\nappeared to catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 075-&gt;0.4 mg/l</span></p> <p>Drinking Water Standards: hydrocarbon total: 10 ug/l (UK max.).</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Asphalt is a native mixture of hydrocarbons which occurs as an amorphous, brownish-black solid or semisolid and results from the evaporation of the lighter hydrocarbons from petroleum and partial oxidation of the residue. Petroleum asphalts (bitumens) should therefore be differentiated from coal pitch bitumens which result from the destructive distillation of coal.</i></p> <p><i>The term \"asphalt\" originally applied to \"Trinidad asphalt\" which is a mined solid and is closely related to gilsonite.</i></p> <p>\u00a0On occasion there are reports of epidemiological studies which have found an increased cancer mortality in workers exposed to heated bitumens and bitumen fumes. There are reports of significantly increased incidence of cancers of the mouth, oesophagus, rectum and lung. The bitumens, used by this cohort, are likely to have their origin in coal and should be distinguished from materials derived from the petroleum industry (the asphalts).</p> <p>Hardened bitumens/ asphalts do not normally constitute a health hazard. Mined sources of bitumens/ asphalts may present an additional hazard related to their naturally occurring content of quartz.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

                "Appearance": "<p>Bitumen (known as asphalt in the U.S.) \"is the residuum produced from the non-destructive distillation of crude petroleum at atmospheric pressure and/ or under reduced pressures or absence of steam. Bitumens/ asphalts are composed mainly of high-molecular-weight alkylaryl hydrocarbons with high carbon to hydrogen ratios, with carbon numbers &gt; C25, boiling points &gt;400 \"C, high viscosity, and negligible water solubility and vapor pressure. These bitumen/ asphalt alkylaryl hydrocarbons are a heterogeneous mixture of linear, branched and cyclic, saturated and unsaturated, and aromatic functional groups. Importantly, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as benzo(a)pyrene, which are toxicologically significant, are only present in bitumen/ asphalt feedstock at very low concentrations.</p> <p>Bitumens/ asphalts contain much larger proportions of high-molecular-weight paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbons that are substituted with alkyl groups and ultimately sulfonated, which reduces their potential to exhibit PAH-like toxicity. In practice, the asphalt alkylaryl feedstocks are chemically characterised by a saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes.</p> <p><b>Saturates</b>\u00a0consist mainly of long chain saturated hydrocarbons with some Saturates branching, alkyl aromatics with long side chains, and cyclic \u00a0paraffins (napthenes), with molecular weight of 500-1000.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Asphaltenes</b>\u00a0consist mainly of substituted benzene and napthenic-aromatic \u00a0nuclei with alkyl side chain constituents, with molecular weight of 500-900.</p> <p><b>Resins\u00a0</b>consist mainly of heterogeneous polar aromatic compounds with small amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, with molecular Resins weight range of 800-2000. Considered lower molecular weight asphaltenes\u00a0</p> <p><b>Asphaltenes</b>\u00a0consist mainly of highly condensed aromatic compounds with one or two chromophores containing 4 to 10 fused rings each, with a significant number of alkyl constituents. They have a molecular weight range of 500-1000.</p> <p>The bitumen/ asphalt group is defined by the following six CAS Numbers: asphalt (penetration or hard) (CAS No. 8052-42-4); vacuum residues (CAS No. 64741-56-6); raffinates, residual oil decarbonization (CAS No. 64742-07-0); petroleum resins (CAS No. 64742-16-1); residues, hydrodesulfurised vacuum (CAS No. 64742-85-4); and asphalt, oxidised (CAS No. 64742-93-4). Small amounts of metals such as nickel, iron or vanadium may be present. Bitumen/ asphalt fumes \u00a0must also be considered in an occupational setting and as fugitive emissions.\u00a0</p> <p>Residual oils are manufactured in whole or in part from distillation residues from refinery processing. Residual oils are complex mixtures of relatively high molecular weight compounds and are difficult to characterise in detail. Molecular types include asphaltenes, polar aromatics, naphthalene aromatics, aromatics, saturated hydrocarbons and heteromolecules containing sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and metals.</p> <p>Most blending stocks of residual fuel oils are likely to contain 5% or more of four- to six-ring condensed aromatic hydrocarbons. In residual fuel oils, the identities and concentration of PAHs depends on the nature and amount of the low viscosity blending stocks and the proportions of virgin and cracked residues used in their production. If the blending stocks are primarily atmospheric or vacuum residues, the concentration of three- to seven-ring aromatic hydrocarbons are likely to be in the order of 6-8%; if larger quantities of heavily catalytically cracked or steam cracked components are used, the levels may approach 20%. One of the blending stocks, catalytically cracked clarified oil has been reported to contain 58% three-to five-ring aromatic hydrocarbons and 22% carbazoles and benzocarbazoles.</p>|Black plastic solid; melts to liquid on heating.

                "Environment": "<p><b>for lubricating oil base stocks:</b></p> <p><b>Vapor Pressure\u00a0</b>Vapor pressures of lubricating base oils are reported to be negligible. In one study, the experimentally measured vapour pressure of a solvent-dewaxed heavy paraffinic distillate base oil was 1.7 x 10exp-4 Pa . Since base oils are mixtures of C15 to C50 paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbon isomers, representative components of those structures were selected to calculate a range of vapor pressures. The estimated vapor pressure values for these selected components of base oils ranged from 4.5 x 10exp-1 Pa to 2 x 10exp-13Pa. Based on Dalton's Law the expected total vapour pressure for base oils would fall well below minimum levels (10exp-5 Pa) of recommended experimental procedures.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Partition Coefficient (log Kow):\u00a0</b>In mixtures such as the base oils, the percent distribution of the hydrocarbon groups (i.e., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and the carbon chain lengths determines in-part the partitioning characteristics of the mixture. Generally, hydrocarbon chains with fewer carbon atoms tend to have lower partition coefficients than those with higher carbon numbers .However, due to their complex composition, unequivocal determination of the log Kow of these hydrocarbon mixtures cannot be made. Rather, partition coefficients of selected C15 chain-length hydrocarbon structures representing paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic constituents in base oil lubricants were modelled . Results showed typical log Kow values from 4.9 to 7.7, which were consistent with values of &gt;4 for lubricating oil basestocks\u00a0</p> <p><b>Water Solubility:</b>When released to water, base oils will float and spread at a rate that is viscosity dependent. While water solubility of base oils is typically very low, individual hydrocarbons exhibit a wide range of solubility depending on molecular weight and degree of unsaturation. Decreasing molecular weight (i.e., carbon number) and increasing levels of unsaturation increases the water solubility of these materials. As noted for partition coefficient, the water solubility of lubricating base oils cannot be determined due to their complex mixture characteristics. Therefore, the water solubility of individual C15 hydrocarbons representing the different groups making up base oils (i.e., linear and branched paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) was modelled. Based on water solubility modelling of those groups, aqueous solubilities are typically much less than 1 ppm. (0.003-0.63 mg/l)</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Chemicals having potential to photolyse have UV/visible absorption maxima in the range of 290 to 800 nm. Some chemicals have absorption maxima significantly below 290 nm and consequently cannot undergo direct photolysis in sunlight (e.g. chemicals such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, saturated alcohols, and saturated acids). Most hydrocarbon constituents of the materials in this category are not expected to photolyse since they do not show absorbance within the 290-800 nm range. However, photodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can occur and may be a significant degradation pathway for these constituents of lubricating base oils. The degree and rate at which PAHs may photodegrade depend upon whether conditions allow penetration of light with sufficient energy to effect a change. For example,polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) compounds bound to sediments may persist due to a lack of sufficient light penetration\u00a0</p> <p>Atmospheric gas-phase reactions can occur between organic chemicals and reactive molecules such as photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen oxides. Atmospheric oxidation as a result of radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but indirect degradation. In general, lubricating base oils have low vapour pressures and volatilisation is not expected to be a significant removal mechanism for the majority of the hydrocarbon components. However, some components (e.g., C15 branched paraffins and naphthenes) appear to have the potential to volatilise Atmospheric half-lives of 0.10 to 0.66 days have been calculated for representative C15 hydrocarbon components of lubricating base oils\u00a0</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Chemicals that have a potential to hydrolyze include alkyl halides, amides, carbamates, carboxylic acid esters and lactones, epoxides, phosphate esters, and sulfonic acid esters. Because lubricating base oils do not contain significant levels of these functional groups, materials in the lubricating base oils category are not subject to hydrolysis\u00a0</p> <p><b>Chemical Transport and Distribution in the Environment :\u00a0</b>Based on the physical-chemical characteristics of component hydrocarbons in lubricating base oils, the lower molecular weight components are expected to have the highest vapour pressures and water solubilities, and the lowest partition coefficients. These factors enhance the potential for widespread distribution in the environment. To gain an understanding of the potential transport and distribution of lubricating base oil components, the EQC (Equilibrium Criterion) model was used to characterize the environmental distribution of different C15 compounds representing different structures found in lube oils (e.g., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics). The modelling found partitioning to soil or air is the ultimate fate of these C15 compounds. Aromatic compounds partition principally to soil. Linear paraffins partition mostly to soil, while branching appears to allow greater distribution to air. Naphthenes distribute to both soil and air, with increasing proportions in soil for components with the greater number of ring structures. Because the modelling does not take into account degradation factors, levels modelled in the atmosphere are likely overstated in light of the tendency for indirect photodegradation to occur.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation: \u00a0T</b>he extent of biodegradation measured for a particular lubricating oil basestock is dependent not only on the procedure used but also on how the sample is presented in the biodegradation test. Lubricant base oils typically are not readily biodegradable in standard 28-day tests. However, since the oils consist primarily of hydrocarbons that are ultimately assimilated by microorganisms, and therefore inherently biodegradable. Twenty-eight biodegradability studies have been reported for a variety of lubricating base oils. Based on the results of ultimate biodegradability tests using modified Sturm and manometric respirometry testing the base oils are expected to be, for the most part, inherently biodegradable. Biodegradation rates found using the modified Sturm procedure ranged from 1.5 to 29%. Results from the manometric respirometry tests on similar materials showed biodegradation rates from 31 to 50%. Biodegradation rates measured in 21-day CEC tests for similar materials ranged from 13 to 79%.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Numerous acute studies covering fish, invertebrates, and algae have been conducted to assess the ecotoxicity of various lubricating base oils. None of these studies have shown evidence of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. Eight, 7-day exposure studies using rainbow trout failed to demonstrate toxicity when tested up to the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Three, 96-hour tests with rainbow trout also failed to show any toxic effects when tested up to 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Similarly, three 96-hour tests with fathead minnows at a maximum test concentration of 100 mg/L water accommodated fractions (WAF) showed no adverse effects. Two species of aquatic invertebrates (Daphnia magna and Gammarus sp.) were exposed to WAF solutions up to 10,000 mg/L for 48 and 96-hours, respectively, with no adverse effects being observed. \u00a0Four-day exposures of the freshwater green alga (Scenedesmus subspicatus) to 500 mg/L WAF solutions failed to show adverse effects on growth rate and algal cell densities in four studies\u00a0</p> <p>Multiple chronic ecotoxicity studies have shown no adverse effects to daphnid survival or reproduction. In 10 of 11 chronic studies, daphnids were exposed for 21 days to WAF preparations of lubricating base oils with no ill effects on survival or reproduction at the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L. One test detected a reduction in reproduction at 1000 mg/L. \u00a0Additional data support findings of no chronic toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fish. No observed effect levels ranged from 550 to 5,000 mg/L when tested as either dispersions or WAFs.\u00a0</p> <p>The data described above are supported by studies on a homologous series of alkanes. The author concluded that the water solubility of carbon chains .C10 is too limited to elicit acute toxicity. This also was shown for alkylbenzene compounds having carbon numbers .C15. Since base oils consist of carbon compounds of C15 to C50, component hydrocarbons that are of acute toxicological concern are, for the most part, absent in these materials. Similarly, due to their low solubility, the alkylated two to three ring polyaromatic components in base oils are not expected to cause acute or chronic toxicity. This lack of toxicity is borne out in the results of the reported studies.\u00a0</p> <p>The effects of crude and refined oils on organisms found in fresh and sea water ha been extensively reviewed.</p> <p>sea water. Where spillages occur the non-mobile species suffer the greatest mortality, whereas fish species can often escape from the affected region. The extent of the initial mortality depends on the chemical nature of the oil, the location, and the physical conditions, particularly the temperature and wind velocity. Most affected freshwater and marine communities recover from the effects of an oil spill within a year. The occurrence of biogenic hydrocarbons in the world's oceans is well recorded. They have the characteristic isoprenoid structure, and measurements made in water columns indicate a background concentration of 1.0 to 10 ul/l. The higher molecular weight materials are dispersed as particles, with the highest concentrations of about 20 ul/l occurring in the top 3 mm layer of water.</p> <p>A wide variation in the response of organisms to oil exposures has been noted. The larvae of fish and crustaceans appear to be most susceptible to the water-soluble fraction of crude oil. Exposures of plankton and algae have indicated that certain species of diatoms and green algae are inhibited, whereas microflagellates are not.</p> <p>For the most part, molluscs and most intertidal worm species appear to be tolerant of oil contamination.</p> <p>for bitumens/ asphalts:</p> <p>This family of hydrocarbon is expected to have similar boiling points, vapor pressures, log Kow values (&gt;10), and water solubilities. Limited environmental fate data also support the grouping of bitumens/ \u00a0asphalts under one category. Bitumen/ asphalts contain complex hydrocarbon mixtures with molecular weights ranging from 500-2000 and carbon numbers predominantly higher than C25, vapor pressures are negligible. The high molecular weights and similar hydrocarbon distributions among the bitumens/ asphalts support the conclusion that the toxicity of this group, in general, is not expected to vary significantly across members.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Upon release to the environment, bitumens/ asphalts are expected to distribute similarly because of their low volatility and limited water solubility. Bitumen/ asphalts are expected to be resistant to biodegradation, and those components that are soluble in water are expected to be resistant to hydrolysis. When bitumen/ asphalts are heated to facilitate paving or roofing applications, the lighter, more volatile components are distilled into the atmosphere. They condense as they cool, forming small droplets of liquid known as bitumen or asphalt fume condensate. The majority of hydrocarbons in bitumen/ asphalts are not susceptible to direct photolysis, since they do not have functional groups that absorb sunlight greater than 290 nm. However, certain aromatic and unsaturated compound members have the potential to undergo photolysis because they absorb light in the environmental UV region. Since bitumens/ asphalts contain high molecular weight hydrocarbons, partitioning to the atmosphere is not considered to be \u00a0important.\u00a0</p> <p>When compositionally analysing bitumens/ asphalts for certain toxicity endpoints the percentage of 3- to 7-ring polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is important. The levels of 3- to 7-ring PAHs are expected to be low considering the processes used to manufacture these substances.. Fumes generated experimentally at high temperatures are more likely to contain carcinogenic PAHs than fumes generated at the lower temperatures usually seen in field samples. Therefore, generating conditions are expected to significantly affect toxicity. .</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Bitumens/ asphalts by analogy with other high molecular weight hydrocarbons are not likely to show adverse acute or chronic ecological effects in aquatic species.\u00a0</p> <p>Drinking Water Standards: hydrocarbon total: 10 ug/l (UK max.).</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to bitumen/ asphalt fumes, over extended periods, may cause central nervous system depression, and liver and kidney changes. Chronic bitumen/ asphalt \u00a0poisoning may result in a decrease in the number of white and red blood cells. [<i>ILO Encyclopedia</i>]</p> <p>Prolonged contact with bitumens may produce irritation, inflammation, dermatitis, acne-like lesions, keratoses, melanosis and photosensitisation.</p> <p>Animal inhalation studies do NOT yield sufficient evidence of bitumen/ asphalt-induced lung cancer. It is generally accepted that oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) destroys their carcinogenic potential and the differing character of the polycyclic aromatic fraction of petroleum asphalt fume and those of coal tar pitch volatiles suggested a lessened potential for carcinogenicity.</p> <p>Inhalation of fumes of heated bitumens by guinea pigs and rats produced chronic fibrosing pneumonitis with peribronchial adenomatosis; rats developed squamous cell metaplasias.</p> <p>Various extracts of steam-refined and air-refined bitumens and their mixtures, undiluted steam-refined bitumens and cracking residue bitumens, produced skin tumours following application to mouse skin. Subcutaneous injection in mice and rats, of steam- and air- reined bitumens, produced sarcomas at the sites of injection. Application of air-refined bitumens, in toluene, to the skin of mice, produced skin tumours. No tumours were produced by the undiluted bitumen. A pooled mixture of steam- and air-blown petroleum bitumen in benzene, produced tumours at the site of application to mouse skin.</p> <p>No significant difference was found in the health of asphalt workers and of groups of controls in a study conducted in 25 oil refineries. Other studies have not demonstrated health defects in paving and roofing operations (using asphalt-based products) and interstate trucking over asphalt highways.</p> <p><i>NOTE: The term bitumen and asphalt are often used interchangeably and have been used to describe products derived from petroleum and/ or coal. Asphalt is a native mixture of hydrocarbons which occurs as an amorphous, brownish-black solid or semisolid and results from the evaporation of the lighter hydrocarbons from petroleum and partial oxidation of the residue. Petroleum asphalts (bitumens) should therefore be differentiated from coal pitch bitumens which result from the destructive distillation of coal.</i></p> <p><i>The term \"asphalt\" originally applied to \"Trinidad asphalt\" which is a mined solid and is closely related to gilsonite.</i></p> <p>\u00a0On occasion there are reports of epidemiological studies which have found an increased cancer mortality in workers exposed to heated bitumens and bitumen fumes. There are reports of significantly increased incidence of cancers of the mouth, oesophagus, rectum and lung. The bitumens, used by this cohort, are likely to have their origin in coal and should be distinguished from materials derived from the petroleum industry (the asphalts).</p> <p>Hardened bitumens/ asphalts do not normally constitute a health hazard. Mined sources of bitumens/ asphalts may present an additional hazard related to their naturally occurring content of quartz. Chronic inhalation of high levels of quartz dusts may produce silicosis, a disabling form of pneumoconiosis which may lead to scarring of the lining of the air-sacs of the lung.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High boiling residues of petroleum process streams produced a significant number of benign and malignant skin tumours after application to the skin of mice. Appreciable concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may be present in residual fuels because of the common practice of using both uncracked and cracked residues in their manufacture.</p>|Chronic exposure to the fumes may cause central nervous system depression, liver and kidney changes.",

In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur. Manganese compound found in these soils\r\nappeared to catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 075-&gt;0.4 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Inhalation of (H2S) at low concentrations causes headache, dizziness and upset stomach. Higher concentrations cause olfactory fatigue, irritation to the respiratory tract, excitement, confusion, and exposure for a prolonged period may cause bronchitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Although hydrogen sulfide is extremely odourous, the \"rotten egg\" odour is not a reliable indicator for warning of exposure since odour fatigue readily occurs.

The lifetime of hydrogen sulfide in oxygenated blood is short and sulfmethaemoglobin is rapidly detoxified by red blood cells and the liver.
