Rapidly fatal cases of poisoning are characterised by congestion and hemorrhages in all organs. The extent of the tissue and organ damage is related to the duration of the post-hypoxic unconsciousness. Exposure to carbon monoxide can result in immediate effects and, depending on the severity of the exposure, delayed effects. These delayed effects may occur days to weeks after the initial exposure. Signs of brain or nerve injury may appear at any time within three weeks following an acute exposure. Characteristically, those patients manifesting delayed neuropathology are middle aged or older. Most of the neurological symptoms associated with carbon monoxide exposure can resolve within a year but memory deficits and gait disturbances may remain</p> <p>Symptoms of poisoning resulting from carbon monoxide exposure include respiratory disorders, diarrhoea and shock. Carbon monoxide competes with oxygen for haemoglobin binding sites and has a 240-fold affinity for these sites compared to oxygen. In addition to oxygen deficiency further disability is produced by the formation of carboxymyoglobin (COHb) in muscles, to produce disturbances in muscle metabolism, particularly that of the heart.</p> <p>The tissues most affected by carbon monoxide are those which are most sensitive to oxygen deprivation such as the brain and the heart. The overt lesion in these tissues is mostly haemorrhage. The severe headache associated with exposure is believed to be caused by cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure resulting from excessive transudate leakage of fluids through the hypoxic capillaries.</p> <p>Carbon monoxide induced hypoxia in the cochlea and brain stem leads to central hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction (vertigo, nausea, vomiting) with the vestibular symptoms usually more prominent than the hearing loss</p> <p>At low levels carbon monoxide may cause poor concentration, memory and vision problems, vertigo, muscular weakness and loss of muscle coordination, rapid and stretorous breathing, intermittent heart beat, loss of sphincter control and rarely coma and death. At higher levels (200 ppm for 2-3 hours), it may cause headaches, fatigue and nausea. At very high levels (400 ppm) the symptoms intensify and will be life-threatening after three hours. Exposure to levels of 1200 ppm or greater are immediately dangerous to life. When carbon monoxide levels in air exceed 3% (30,000 ppm), death occurs almost at once.\u00a0</p> <p>Carbon monoxide is not a cumulative poison since COHb is fully dissociable and once exposure has ceased, the hemoglobin will revert to oxyhemoglobin.

Reaction products arising from electrode core and flux appear as welding fume depending on welding conditions, relative volatilities of metal oxides and any coatings on the workpiece. Studies of lung cancer among welders indicate that they may experience a 30-40% increased risk compared to the general population. Since smoking and exposure to other cancer-causing agents, such as asbestos fibre, may influence these results, it is not clear whether welding, in fact, represents a significant lung cancer risk. Whilst mild steel welding represents little risk, the stainless steel welder, exposed to chromium and nickel fume, may be at risk and it is this factor which may account for the overall increase in lung cancer incidence among welders. Cold isolated electrodes are relatively harmless.</p> <p>Long-term (chronic) exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide may produce heart disease and damage to the nervous system. Exposure of pregnant animals to carbon monoxide may cause low birthweight, increased foetal mortality and nervous system damage to the offspring.</p> <p>Carbon monoxide is a common cause of fatal poisoning in industry and homes.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>Chronic excessive iron exposure has been associated with haemosiderosis and consequent possible damage to the liver and pancreas. Haemosiderin is a golden-brown insoluble protein produced by phagocytic digestion of haematin (an iron-based pigment). Haemosiderin is found in most tissues, especially in the liver, in the form of granules. Other sites of haemosiderin deposition include the pancreas and skin. A related condition, haemochromatosis, which involves a disorder of metabolism of these deposits, may produce cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, and bronze pigmentation of the skin - heart failure may eventually occur.</p> <p>\u00a0Such exposure may also produce conjunctivitis, choroiditis, retinitis (both inflammatory conditions involving the eye) and siderosis of tissues if iron remains in these tissues. Siderosis is a form of pneumoconiosis produced by iron dusts. Siderosis also includes discoloration of organs, excess circulating iron and degeneration of the retina, lens and uvea as a result of the deposition of intraocular iron. Siderosis might also involve the lungs - involvement rarely develops before ten years of regular exposure. Often there is an accompanying inflammatory reaction of the bronchi. Permanent scarring of the lungs does not normally occur.</p> <p>\u00a0High levels of iron may raise the risk of cancer. This concern stems from the theory that iron causes oxidative damage to tissues and organs by generating highly reactive chemicals, called free radicals, which subsequently react with DNA. Cells may be disrupted and may be become cancerous. People whose genetic disposition prevents them from keeping tight control over iron (e.g. those with the inherited disorder, haemochromatosis) may be at increased risk.</p> <p>Iron overload in men may lead to diabetes, arthritis, liver cancer, heart irregularities and problems with other organs as iron builds up.</p> <p>\u00a0[K.

First, through cation\r\nexchange reactions, manganese ions and the charged surface of soil particles\r\nform manganese oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides which in turn form\r\nabsorption sites for other metals. Secondly, manganese can be adsorbed to other\r\noxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides through ligand exchange reactions. When\r\nthe soil solution becomes saturated, these manganese oxides, hydroxides, and\r\noxyhydroxides can precipitate into a new mineral phase and act as a new surface\r\nto which other substances can absorb. &nbsp;The tendency of soluble manganese\r\ncompounds to adsorb to soils and sediments depends mainly on the cation\r\nexchange capacity and the organic composition of the soil. The soil adsorption\r\nconstants (the ratio of the concentration in soil to the concentration in\r\nwater) for Mn(II) span five orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.2 to 10,000\r\nmL/g, increasing as a function of the organic content and the ion exchange\r\ncapacity of the soil; thus, adsorption may be highly variable. In some cases,\r\nadsorption of manganese to soils may not be a readily reversible process. At\r\nlow concentrations, manganese may be &quot;fixed&quot; by clays and will not be\r\nreleased into solution readily. At higher concentrations, manganese may be\r\ndesorbed by ion exchange mechanisms with other ions in solution. For example,\r\nthe discharge of waste water effluent into estuarine environments resulted in\r\nthe mobilization of manganese from the bottom sediments. The metals in the\r\neffluent may have been preferentially adsorbed resulting in the release of\r\nmanganese. The oxidation state of manganese in soil and sediments may be\r\naltered by microbial activity; oxidation may lead to the precipitation of\r\nmanganese. Bacteria and microflora can increase the mobility of manganese.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The transport and partitioning of manganese in water is controlled\r\nby the solubility of the specific chemical form present, which in turn is\r\ndetermined by pH, Eh (oxidation-reduction potential), and the characteristics\r\nof the available anions.

In relatively\r\noxidized water, the solubility of Mn(II) may be controlled by manganese oxide\r\nequilibria, with manganese being converted to the Mn(II) or Mn(IV) oxidation\r\nstates. In extremely reduced water, the fate of manganese tends to be\r\ncontrolled by formation of a poorly soluble sulfide. Manganese in water may\r\nundergo oxidation at high pH or Eh and is also subject to microbial activity.\r\nFor example, Mn(II) in a lake was oxidized during the summer months, but this\r\nwas inhibited by a microbial poison, indicating that the oxidation was mediated\r\nby bacteria . The microbial metabolism of manganese is presumed to be a\r\nfunction of pH, temperature, and other factors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Manganese in water may be significantly bioconcentrated at lower\r\ntrophic levels.

Some removal by washout\r\nmechanisms such as rain may also occur, although it is of minor significance in\r\ncomparison to dry deposition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Manganese ion is toxic to aqueous organisms</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fish LC50 (28 d): orfe 2490 mg/l, trout 2.91 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Daphnia magna LC50: 50 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Pseudomonas putida LC50: 10.6 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Photobacterium phosphoreum LC50: 14.7 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Turbellarian worms (EC0): Polycelis nigra 660 mg/l (interference\r\nthreshold); microregma 31 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur.

It is also necessary for nitrogen-fixation by soil bacteria; livestock poisoning has been recorded in animals feeding on herbage containing high levels of molybdenum.

Molybdenum disturbs bone metabolism, giving rise to lameness, bone joint abnormalities, osteoporosis and high serum phosphatase levels.Cattle, rabbits, and chicks on high dietary levels of molybdenum exhibited deformities of joints of the extremities. Low molybdenum intake has been attributed to the high incidence of oesophageal cancer in South Africa among the Bantu of Transkei, in China and in Russia.</p> <p>Chronic exposure of workers in Russian molybdenum-copper plant resulted in a fall in the albumin/globulin ratio owing to a rise in globulins (particularly alpha-globulins) which is interpreted as evidence of liver dysfunction with hyperbilirubinaemia. Hepatotoxic effects are also found in animals given molybdenum salts with a rise in alpha-globulin levels, hypoalbuminaemia and increased serum bilirubin reported. Other reported biochemical effects include an early depletive effect on tissue nicotinamide nucleotides, hyperaminoaciduria, reduction in red blood cell life-span and hyper-thyroidism. Industrial exposure to some insoluble molybdenum compounds is thought to have resulted in an increased incidence of weakness, fatigue, anorexia, headache and joint and muscular pain. \u00a0Under the conditions of a 2-year inhalation study* there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of molybdenum trioxide in male rats, male mice and female mice based on a marginally significant positive trend of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats exposed to 10, 30 and 100 mg/m3. Exposure of male and female rats to molybdenum trioxide by inhalation resulted in increased incidences of chronic alveolar inflammation, hyaline degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (females), hyaline degeneration of the respiratory epithelium and squamous metaplasia of the epiglottis. Exposure of female and male mice to molybdenum trioxide resulted in an increased incidence of metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium, histiocyte cellular inflammation (males), hyaline degeneration of the respiratory epithelium, hyaline degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (females), squamous metaplasia of the epiglottis, and hyperplasia of the larynx.\u00a0</p> <p>Guinea pigs exposed to molybdenum trioxide dust for 1 hour daily at 250 mg/m3 showed extreme irritation. \u00a0Symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhoea, muscular incoordination and loss of hair. \u00a0Of the 51 animals exposed, 26 died after the tenth exposure. \u00a0Exposure to freshly generated MoO2 fume under about the same exposure conditions proved unexpectedly less toxic, with only 8.3% mortality compared with 51% mortality with the dust, and no mortality when the exposure level was reduced to about one-third (57 mg Mo/m3). \u00a0Explanation for this unexpected finding was felt to reside in the more rapid solution and elimination of the large surface area fume particle. [Patty's]</p> <p>Exposure of male and female rats to molybdenum trioxide resulted in the development of respiratory system lesions. In the lung, the incidence and severity of chronic alveolar inflammation increased with increasing exposure concentration in male and female rats. In some male rats, exposure to the material resulted in alveolar/ bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas. Lesions in the nose (hyaline degeneration) and larynx (squamous metaplasia) were considered to be a non-specific defensive or adaptive response to chronic inhalation exposure. Inhalation exposure of mice to molybdenum trioxide was associated with the development of lung neoplasms and an increased incidence of alveolar/ bronchiolar carcinoma or adenoma in both sexes. Chronic inflammatory lesions were not present in the lungs. Lesions of the nose and larynx were similar to those observed in rats.</p> <p>Molybdenum trioxide was not mutagenic in any of five strains of Salmonella typhimurium and did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro. All tests were conducted with or without S9 metabolic activation enzymes.</p> <p>Pneumoconiosis has been described in experimental animals exposed sub-chronically to molybdenum trioxide.</p> <p>The mechanism of molybdenum trioxide action in lung carcinogenicity is not known; the material is not mutagenic. Non-neoplastic lesions of the nose and larynx of rats and in the nose, larynx and lungs of mice were apparently due to the development of a more durable epithelium in response to chronic exposure.</p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (1) concluded that there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male F344/N rats based on a marginally significant positive trend of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma; that there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats; that there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice and that there was evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1 mice</p> <p>\u00a0National Toxicology Program: Technical Report Series 462, April 1997</p> <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Transport and distribution of nickel particulates between different environmental compartments, is strongly influenced by particle size. Fine particulate matter has a longer residence time in the environment and is carried a long distance from its source; larger particles are deposited near the emission source. Atmospheric residence time for nickel particulates is estimated to be 5.4-7.9 days. Water solubility and bioavailability is affected by soil pH; decrease in pH generally mobilises nickel, thus acid rain can mobilise nickel from the soil and increase nickel concentrations in ground water. Nickel bioaccumulates in the food chain but is not bioconcentrated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Nickel 50 ug/l (UK max.)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a020 ug/l (WHO guideline)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Soil Guidelines:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Dutch Criteria: 35 mg/kg (target)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0210 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma.

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>The most common toxic reaction to nickel is skin sensitisation which may produce a chronic eczema called \"nickel itch\". The first symptom is itching which occurs up to 7 days prior to the appearance of skin eruption. The primary skin eruption is erythematous or follicular and may be followed by superficial discrete ulcers (which discharge and become crusted), or eczema. In the chronic stages, pigmented or depigmented plaques may be formed. Recovery from the dermatitis usually occurs within 7 days but may take several weeks.</p> <p>\u00a0Nickel dusts and several specific compounds are carcinogenic in animals following inhalation or parenteral administration (but not by ingestion or skin contact). Increases in lung and nasal cavity cancers have been observed amongst nickel workers in smelters and refineries. Respiratory cancer risks primarily relate to chronic exposure to soluble nickels at concentrations in excess of 1 mg Ni/m3 and exposure to the less soluble forms at concentrations greater than 10 mg Ni/m3. Metallic nickel does not appear to pose such a threat.</p> <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

Trivalent chromium is less toxic than the hexavalent form. The main signs of toxicity are inhibition of growth and the inhibition of various metabolic processes such as photosynthesis or protein synthesis. Gram-negative soil bacteria are generally more sensitive to hexavalent chromium (1-12 mg/kg) than the gram-positive types. Toxicity to trivalent chromium is not observed at similar levels. The toxicity of low levels of hexavalent chromium (1 mg/kg) indicates that soil microbial transformation, such as nitrification, may be affected. Chromium should not be introduced to municipal sewage treatment facilities.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Toxicity in Plants: Chromium in high concentrations can be toxic for plants. The main feature of chromium intoxication is chlorosis, which is similar to iron deficiency. Chromium affects carbohydrate metabolism and leaf chlorophyll concentration decreases with hexavalent chromium concentration (0.01-1 mg/l). The hexavalent form appears to more toxic than the trivalent species.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Biological half-life: The elimination curve for chromium, as measured by whole-body counting, has an exponential form. In rats, three different components of the curve have been identified, with half-lives of 0.5, 5.9 and 83.4 days, respectively.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Water Standards: Chromium is identified as a hazardous substance in the Federal (U.S.) Water Pollution Control Act and further regulated by Clean Air Water Act Amendments (US). These regulations apply to discharge. The US Primary drinking water Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL), for chromium, is 0.05 mg/l (total chromium).</p> <p>Since chromium compounds cannot volatilize from water, transport of chromium from water to the atmosphere is not likely, except by transport in windblown sea sprays. Most of the chromium released into water will ultimately be deposited in the sediment. A very small percentage of chromium can be present in water in both soluble and insoluble forms. Soluble chromium generally accounts for a very small percentage of the total chromium. Most of the soluble chromium is present as chromium(VI) and soluble chromium(III) complexes. In the aquatic phase, chromium(III) occurs mostly as suspended solids adsorbed onto clayish materials, organics, or iron oxide (Fe2O3) present in water. Soluble forms and suspended chromium can undergo intramedia transport. Chromium(VI) in water will eventually be reduced to chromium(III) by organic matter in the water.</p> <p>The reduction of chromium(VI) and the oxidation of chromium(III) in water has been investigated. The reduction of chromium(VI) by S-2 or Fe+2 ions under anaerobic conditions was fast, and the reduction half-life ranged from instantaneous to a few days. However, the reduction of chromium(VI) by organic sediments and soils was much slower and depended on the type and amount of organic material and on the redox condition of the water. The reaction was generally faster under anaerobic than aerobic conditions. The reduction half-life of chromium(VI) in water with soil and sediment ranged from 4 to 140 day. Dissolved oxygen by itself in natural waters did not cause any measurable oxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI) in 128 days. When chromium(III) was added to lake water, a slow oxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI) occurred, corresponding to an oxidation half-life of nine years. The oxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI) during chlorination of water was highest in the pH range of 5.5?6.0. However, the process would rarely occur during chlorination of drinking water because of the low concentrations of chromium(III) in these waters, and the presence of naturally occurring organics that may protect chromium(III) from oxidation, either by forming strong complexes with chromium(III) or by acting as a reducing agent to free available chlorine.</p> <p>The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for chromium(VI) in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) is 1. In bottom feeder bivalves, such as the oyster (Crassostrea virginica), blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), and soft shell clam (Mya arenaria), the BCF values for chromium(III) and chromium(VI) may range from 86 to 192.</p> <p>The bioavailability of chromium(III) to freshwater invertebrates (Daphnia pulex) decreased with the addition of humic acid. This decrease in bioavailability was attributed to lower availability of the free form of the metal due to its complexation with humic acid. Based on this information, chromium is not expected to biomagnify in the aquatic food chain. Although higher concentrations of chromium have been reported in plants growing in high chromium-containing soils (e.g., soil near ore deposits or chromium-emitting industries and soil fertilized by sewage sludge) compared with plants growing in normal soils, most of the increased uptake in plants is retained in roots, and only a small fraction is translocated in the aboveground part of edible plants. Therefore, bioaccumulation of chromium from soil</p> <p>to above-ground parts of plants is unlikely. There is no indication of biomagnification of chromium along the terrestrial food chain (soil-plant-animal).</p> <p>The fate of chromium in soil is greatly dependent upon the speciation of chromium, which is a function of redox potential and the pH of the soil. In most soils, chromium will be present predominantly in the chromium(III) state. This form has very low solubility and low reactivity resulting in low mobility in the environment and low toxicity in living organisms. Under oxidizing conditions chromium(VI) may be present in soil as CrO4?2 and HCrO4-. In this form, chromium is relatively soluble, mobile, and toxic to living organisms. In deeper soil where anaerobic conditions exist, chromium(VI) will be reduced to chromium(III) by S-2 and Fe+2 present in soil. The reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) is possible in aerobic soils that contain appropriate organic energy sources to carry out the redox reaction. The reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) is facilitated by low pH. From thermodynamic considerations, chromium(VI) may exist in the aerobic zone of some natural soil. The oxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI) in soil is facilitated by the presence of low oxidisable organic substances, oxygen, manganese dioxide, and moisture. Organic forms of chromium(III) (e.g., humic acid complexes) are more easily oxidised than insoluble oxides. Because most chromium(III) in soil is immobilized due to adsorption and complexation with soil materials, the barrier to this oxidation process is the lack of availability of mobile chromium(III) to immobile manganese dioxide in soil surfaces. Due to this lack of availability of mobile chromium(III) to manganese dioxide surfaces, a large portion of chromium in soil will not be oxidized to chromium(VI), even in the presence of manganese dioxide and favorable pH conditions.</p> <p>The microbial reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) has been discussed as a possible remediation technique in heavily contaminated environmental media or wastes. Factors affecting the microbial reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) include biomass concentration, initial chromium(VI) concentration, temperature, pH, carbon source, oxidation-reduction potential and the presence of both oxyanions and metal cations. Although high levels of chromium(VI) are toxic to most microbes, several resistant bacterial species have been identified which could ultimately be employed in remediation strategies</p> <p>Chromium in soil is present mainly as insoluble oxide Cr2O3. nH2O, and is not very mobile in soil. A leachability study was conducted to study the mobility of chromium in soil. Due to differentpH values, a complicated adsorption process was observed and chromium moved only slightly in soil.</p> <p>Chromium was not found in the leachate from soil, possibly because it formed complexes with organic matter. These results support previous data finding that chromium is not very mobile in soil. These results are supported by leachability investigation in which chromium mobility was studied for a period of 4 years in a sandy loam. The vertical migration pattern of chromium in this soil indicated that after an initial period of mobility, chromium forms insoluble complexes and little leaching is observed. Flooding of soils and the subsequent anaerobic decomposition of plant detritus matters may increase the mobilization of chromium(III) in soils due to formation of soluble complexes. This complexation may be facilitated by a lower soil pH. A smaller percentage of total chromium in soil exists as soluble chromium(VI) and chromium(III), which are more mobile in soil. The mobility of soluble chromium in soil will depend on the sorption characteristics of the soil. The relative retention of metals by soil is in the order of lead &gt; antimony &gt; copper &gt; chromium &gt; zinc &gt; nickel &gt; cobalt &gt; cadmium. The sorption of chromium to soil depends primarily on the clay content of the soil and, to a lesser extent, on Fe2O3 and the organic content of soil. Chromium that is irreversibly sorbed onto soil, for example, in the interstitial lattice of geothite, FeOOH, will not be bioavailable to plants and animals under any condition. Organic matter in soil is expected to convert soluble chromate, chromium(VI), to insoluble chromium(III) oxide, Cr2O3. Chromium in soil may be transported to the atmosphere as an aerosol. Surface runoff from soil can transport both soluble and bulk precipitate of chromium to surface water. Soluble and unadsorbed chromium(VI) and chromium(III) complexes in soil may leach into groundwater. The leachability of chromium(VI) in the soil increases as the pH of the soil increases. On the other hand, lower pH present in acid rain may facilitate leaching of acid-soluble chromium(III) and chromium(VI) compounds in soil.</p> <p>Chromium has a low mobility for translocation from roots to aboveground parts of plants. However, depending on the geographical areas where the plants are grown, the concentration of chromium in aerial parts of certain plants may differ by a factor of 2?3.</p> <p>In the atmosphere, chromium(VI) may be reduced to chromium(III) at a significant rate by vanadium (V2+, V3+, and VO2+), Fe2+, HSO3-, and As3+. Conversely, chromium(III), if present as a salt other than Cr2O3, may be oxidized to chromium(VI) in the atmosphere in the presence of at least 1% manganese oxide.. However, this reaction is unlikely under most environmental conditions. The estimated atmospheric half-life for chromium(VI) reduction to chromium(III) was reported in the range of 16 hours to about 5 days</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>for insoluble\r\nchrome(VI)-containing substances:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>There is little environmental\r\ndata regarding exposures and possible links to increased respiratory cancers.\r\nThe recommended TLV is thought to provide an adequate margin of safety pending\r\na review of the complexities involved in the scientific issues related to\r\nchromate carcinogenicity.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of freshly formed metal oxide particles sized below 1.5 microns and generally between 0.02 to 0.05 microns may result in \"metal fume fever\". Symptoms may be delayed for up to 12 hours and begin with the sudden onset of thirst, and a sweet, metallic or foul taste in the mouth. Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur. Tolerance to the fumes develops rapidly, but is quickly lost. All symptoms usually subside within 24-36 hours following removal from exposure.</p> <p>Chrome fume is irritating to the respiratory tract and lungs.

Cr-VI) may cause irritation to mucous membranes with symptoms such as sneezing, rhinorrhoea, lesions of the nasal septum, irritation and redness of the throat and generalised bronchospasm.</p> <p>Inhalation of chromium fumes may cause metal fume fever' characterised by flu-like symptoms, fever, chill, nausea, weakness and body aches.</p> <p>Toxic effects result from over-exposure.

Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>Chromium(III) is considered an essential trace nutrient serving as a component of the \"glucose tolerance factor\" and a cofactor for insulin action. High concentrations of chromium are also found in RNA. Trivalent chromium is the most common form found in nature.</p> <p>\u00a0Chronic inhalation of trivalent chromium compounds produces irritation of the bronchus and lungs, dystrophic changes to the liver and kidney, pulmonary oedema, and adverse effects on macrophages. Intratracheal administration of chromium(III) oxide, in rats, increased the incidence of sarcomas, and tumors and reticulum cell sarcomas of the lung. There is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity of chromium(III) compounds in experimental animals and humans (IARC).</p> <p>\u00a0Chronic exposure to hexavalent chromium compounds reportedly produces skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation, yellowing of the eyes and skin, allergic skin and respiratory reactions, diminished sense of smell and</p> <p>taste, blood disorders, liver and kidney damage, digestive disorders and lung damage. There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity of chromium(VI) compounds in experimental animals and humans to confirm these as Class 1 carcinogens (IARC).</p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to chromium during chrome production and in the chrome pigment industry is associated with cancer of the respiratory tract. A slight increase in gastrointestinal cancer following exposure to chromium compounds has also been reported. The greatest risk is attributed to exposure to acid-soluble, water-insoluble hexavalent chromium which occurs in roasting and refining processes. Animal studies support the idea that the most potent carcinogenic compounds are the slightly soluble hexavalent compounds. The cells are more active in the uptake of the hexavalent forms compared to trivalent forms and this may explain the difference in occupational effect. It is the trivalent form, however, which is metabolically active and binds with nucleic acid within the cell suggesting that chromium mutagenesis first requires biotransformation of the hexavalent form by reduction.</p> <p>\u00a0Hexavalent chromes produce chronic ulceration of skin surfaces (quite independent of other hypersensitivity reactions exhibited by the skin). Water-soluble chromium(VI) compounds come close to the top of any published \"hit list\" of contact allergens (eczematogens) producing positive results in 4 to 10% of tested individuals. On the other hand only chromium(III) compounds can bind to high molecular weight carriers such as proteins to form a complete allergen (such as a hapten). Chromium(VI) compounds cannot. It is assumed that reduction must take place for such compounds to manifest any contact sensitivity. The apparent contradiction that chromium(VI) salts cause allergies to chromium(III) compounds but that allergy to chromium(III) compounds is difficult to demonstrate is accounted for by the different solubilities and skin penetration of these compounds. Water-soluble chromium(VI) salts penetrate the horny layer of the skin more readily than chromium(III) compounds which are bound by cross-linking in the horny layer (\"tanning\", as for leather) and therefore do not reach the cells involved in antigen processing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to fume containing high concentrations of water-soluble chromium (VI) during the welding of stainless steels in confined spaces has been reported to result in chronic chrome intoxication, dermatitis and asthma. Certain insoluble chromium (VI) compounds have been named as carcinogens (by the ACGIH) in other work environments. Chromium may also appear in welding fumes as Cr2O3 or double oxides with iron. These chromium (III) compounds are generally biologically inert.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Copper is unlikely to accumulate in the atmosphere due to a short residence time for airborne copper aerosols. Airborne coppers, however, may be transported over large distances. Copper accumulates significantly in the food chain.</p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>3000 ug/l (UK max)</p> <p>2000 ug/l (WHO provisional Guideline)</p> <p>1000 ug/l (WHO level where individuals complain)</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: Dutch Criteria</p> <p>36 mg/kg (target)</p> <p>190 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: no data available.</p> <p>\u00a0The toxic effect of copper in the aquatic biota depends on the bio-availability of copper in water which, in turn, depends on its physico-chemical form (ie.speciation). \u00a0Bioavailability is decreased by complexation and adsorption of copper by natural organic matter, iron and manganese hydrated oxides, and chelating agents excreted by algae and other aquatic organisms. Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction.

The material is a physical irritant to the gastro-intestinal tract</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",

Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p> <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0for ozone:</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for ozone, measuring in excess of 0.05 ppm, are commercially available.</p> <p>Exposure at 0.2 ppm appears to produce mild acute but not cumulative effects. It is thought that exposures of the order of 0.1 ppm will be tolerated by most workers including asthmatics. Chronic exposure at 0.1 ppm or more can induce significant adverse effects in the lower respiratory tract of both normal and atopic individuals.</p> <p>Human exposure for 2 hours at an average concentration of 1.5 ppm ozone resulted in a 20% reduction in timed vital capacity of the lung and other effects. Concentrations of ozone in excess of a few tenths ppm cause occasional discomfort to exposed individuals manifest as headache, dryness of the throat and mucous membranes of the eyes and nose following exposures of short duration.</p> <p>Exposure to ozone during moderate to heavy work loads results in significantly decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 0.12 ppm; this is effect is greater at higher concentrations.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor(OSF)</p> <p>OSF=1.1 (OZONE)</p> <p>May act as a simple asphyxiants; these are gases which, when present in high concentrations, reduce the oxygen content in air below that required to support breathing, consciousness and life; loss of consciousness, with death by suffocation may rapidly occur in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.</p> <p><b>CARE</b>: Most simple asphyxiants are odourless or possess low odour and there is no warning on entry into an oxygen deficient atmosphere. If there is any doubt, oxygen content can be checked simply and quickly.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce toxic effects.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Ozone causes dryness of the mouth, coughing, and irritates the nose, throat, and chest. It may cause difficulty in breathing, headache, and fatigue. The characteristic sharp, irritating odor is readily detectable at low concentrations (0.01 to 0.05 ppm). Ozone produces local irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes and may cause pulmonary edema at high exposure. Systematically, ozone has been reported to mimic the effects of ionising radiation, and may cause damage to chromosomal structures. A partial tolerance appears to develop with repeated exposures. Although most effects are acute, the possibility of chronic lung impairment should be considered, based upon animal experimentation</p> <p>A short exposure at 1-2 ppm produces headache as well as irritation, but the symptoms disappear when removed from exposure. Higher exposure (higher concentration and/or time) produces nausea, pain in chest, cough, breathing difficulties and tiredness.</p> <p>Symptoms of oedema from exposure can be delayed one or more hours. Acute damage from ozone appears to be mainly from its oxidising effect on contact with tissue, but regular exposure to low concentrations may have chronic effects on the lung tissues.</p> <p>Indications exist that there are secondary sites of reaction to ozone characterised by a defect in the dissociation of ozone from oxyhaemoglobin.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>Symptoms of asphyxia (suffocation) may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and ringing in the ears. If the asphyxia is allowed to progress, there may be nausea and vomiting, further physical weakness and unconsciousness and, finally, convulsions, coma and death. Significant concentrations of the non-toxic gas reduce the oxygen level in the air. As the amount of oxygen is reduced from 21 to 14 volume %, the pulse rate accelerates and the rate and volume of breathing increase. The ability to maintain attention and think clearly is diminished and muscular coordination is somewhat disturbed. As oxygen decreases from 14-10% judgement becomes faulty; severe injuries may cause no pain. Muscular exertion leads to rapid fatigue. Further reduction to 6% may produce nausea and vomiting and the ability to move may be lost. Permanent brain damage may result even after resuscitation at exposures to this lower oxygen level. Below 6% breathing is in gasps and convulsions may occur. Inhalation of a mixture containing no oxygen may result in unconsciousness from the first breath and death will follow in a few minutes.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing. Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Common, generalised symptoms associated with toxic gas inhalation include:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>central nervous system effects such as depression, headache, confusion, dizziness, progressive stupor, coma and seizures;\u00a0</li> <li>respiratory system complications may include acute pulmonary oedema, dyspnoea, stridor, tachypnoea, bronchospasm, wheezing and other reactive airway symptoms, and respiratory arrest;\u00a0</li> <li>cardiovascular effects may include cardiovascular collapse, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest;\u00a0</li> <li>gastrointestinal effects may also be present and may include mucous membrane irritation, nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody), and abdominal pain.\u00a0</li> </ul>",

Exposure of both male and female rats to ozone for 2-years was associated with goblet cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in the larynx in the nose, squamous metaplasia in the larynx and metaplasia (extension of the epithelium into the centriacinar alveolar ducts) and interstitial fibrosis in the lung. Male and female mice exhibited hyperplasia in the nose and inflammation (histiocytic infiltration) and metaplasia (extension of the bronchial epithelium into the centriacinar alveolar ducts) of the lung.</p> <p>Male rats injected with the genotoxin 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosoamino)-1-3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone (NNK), 3 times a week for 20 weeks, prior to inhalation exposure to ozone for two years showed no evidence of an increase in the incidence of pulmonary neoplasms.</p>",

The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant.

Inhalation of high concentrations of the gas, mixed with air or oxygen, produces an anaesthetic effect. Inhalation of small amounts often produces a state of euphoria.</p> <p>Nitrous oxide is harmless and non-irritating to the respiratory tract, but concentrations over 50 ppm reduce dexterity, cognition and motor and audiovisual skills .\u00a0</p> <p>Nitrogen oxides (NOx) may present a hazard after a single exposure; severe exposures may be lethal. Inhalation symptoms may not be felt until hours or days following exposure, even though extensive pulmonary damage may have occurred. The typical reaction to nitrous fume is delayed and insidious because the oxides are largely absorbed by and react with alveolar structures and terminal respiratory bronchii. The upper respiratory tract is largely spared because the gas has relatively low solubility in mucous fluids. Warning properties of the gas, as a result, are largely absent.</p> <p>The pattern of response to nitrogen oxide exposure typically consists of three phases. Initially, there is a mild irritation of the upper respiratory tract with symptomatic cough, sore throat, conjunctivitis, dyspnoea, headache, vertigo, brief nausea and less commonly, rhinitis, somnolence, loss of consciousness, and chest tightness. Other symptoms of exposure to nitrogen oxides include dizziness, vomiting and fatigue.</p> <p>Mild exposures generally does not result in symptoms persisting for more than a few hours. Heavier exposures produce a suite of effects. After a latent period of 3 to 30 hours, patients may develop pulmonary oedema, with chills, fever, tachypnoea, tachycardia, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, wheezing, cyanosis, circulatory system effects, severe haemoconcentration, and rales. These may result in acute respiratory failure. Anoxia may also develop. About 50% of individuals surviving pulmonary oedema may show a late developing complication involving fibrotic destruction of terminal bronchioles (bronchiolitis obliterans) within 10-42 days. Symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, cyanosis, and progressive dyspnoea. Methaemoglobinaemia and hypotension may be complicating factors. Bronchial infection and pulmonary fibrosis may complicate recovery.</p> <p>High concentrations may lead to acute respiratory difficulty with uncontrollable coughing, cyanosis, throat pains, convulsions and acute circulatory insufficiency. Interstitial oedema, epithelial proliferation, fibrosis and emphysema may develop. Death may result from delayed pulmonary oedema with initial symptoms comprising no more than mild irritation of the respiratory tract and eyes. Only very high vapour concentrations induce prompt or immediate symptoms except perhaps for slight or transient cough, mild fatigue and brief nausea. Slowly evolving but progressive inflammation of the lungs may arise 5-72 hours following heavy exposure. This results in profuse exudation into alveolar spaces. Fluid loss from the blood may produce massive pulmonary oedema. Because of impaired gas exchange, breathing becomes rapid and cyanosis intense. Death may result from asphyxia.</p> <p>Because of its poor water solubility, nitrogen dioxide is potentially an irritating gas but few reports of ocular or upper respiratory tract effects are available. Irritant action results from the formation of nitric acid in the presence of water. Nitric acid is destructive to respiratory epithelium and alveolar membranes and may produce metabolic acidosis. The poor initial irritant effects allow widespread dissemination of nitrogen oxides throughout the lungs and a diffuse, delayed inflammation. Nitrogen dioxide decomposition may also produce nitrates, which in turn may produce vasodilation and methaemoglobin. Animals exposed to 70 ppm for 8 hours developed periorbital oedema and corneal opacities.</p> <p>Occupational exposure to nitrogen oxides results in a condition identified as \"Silo Filler's Disease\". Most individuals exhibit symptoms resembling influenza (fever, chills, cough, chest pain and dyspnoea). Although recovery is generally complete, the symptoms in some individuals may progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome and/ or subsequent bronchiolitis obliterans.</p> <p>Inhalation of significant levels of nitrogen oxides may adversely affect the functions of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal dysfunction leads to significant and deleterious changes in electrolytes and carbohydrate metabolism leading to circulatory collapse, hypoglycaemic coma and death.</p> <p>Cardiovascular effects have also been noted amongst patients receiving nitric oxide donators (e.g nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate and pentaerythritol) for hypertension and heart disease. These drugs often produce a catastrophic drop in systemic blood pressure (due to vasodilation) producing a continuum of symptoms ranging from mild dizziness or light-headedness, fainting upon standing, or even a heart attack or stroke.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct contact with the eye may not cause irritation because of the extreme volatility of the gas; however concentrated atmospheres may produce irritation after brief exposures..</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The vapour when concentrated has pronounced eye irritation effects and this gives some warning of high vapour concentrations. If eye irritation occurs seek to reduce exposure with available control measures, or evacuate area.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to produce harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives using animal models). Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Reactions may not occur on exposure but response may be delayed with symptoms only appearing many hours later</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Solution of material in moisture on the skin, or perspiration, may markedly increase skin corrosion and accelerate tissue destruction</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "Repeated inhalation may result in bronchitis or emphysema.|55r33#? <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",
