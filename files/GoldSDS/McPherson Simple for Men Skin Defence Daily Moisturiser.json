Pre-adapted microorganisms can degrade glycerol rapidly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.<br /> Bioaccumulation: Based on Log Kow -1.76, glycerol will have a low bioaccumulation potential and is not expected to bioaccumulate.<br /> Photodegradation: The calculated half-life for the photo-oxidation (reaction with hydroxyl radicals) of glycerol in air is 6.8 hours (EPIWIN vs 3.04).<br /> Stability in Water:\u00a0 Glycerol does not contain functional groups that are expected to react with water.<br /> Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0 From the EQC model (Mackay level III), it can be deduced that 100% of glycerol will end up in the water phase.

The lowest LC50 for fish is a 24-h LC50 of &gt;5000 mg/l for Carassius auratus (Goldfish) and for aquatic invertebrates, a 24 h EC50 of &gt;10000 mg/l for Daphnia magna is the lowest EC50. Several tests on algae are available, which suggest very low toxicity to a range of species, however their validity is uncertain. A QSAR prediction for the 96h EC50 to algae was 78000 mg/l. No toxicity towards the microorganism Pseudomonas putida was observed at 10000 mg/l after exposure for 16 hours. No long-term aquatic toxicity data is available. Screening studies are available on frog and carp embryos which indicate some effects on growth and hatching rates respectively at very high concentrations of glycerol, &gt;7000 mg/l.

OSHA concluded that the nuisance particulate limit would protect the worker form kidney damage and perhaps, testicular effects.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Used as an emulsifying agent for margarine, oils, waxes and solvents; as a food additive; as an opacifier, detackifier and a resin lubricant. In pharmaceutical dispensing for cosmetic use.|<p><span style=\"color:black\">A triglyceride (TG,\r\ntriacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol\r\nand three fatty acids (from tri- and glyceride)\u00a0 Triglycerides are the main\r\nconstituents of body fat in humans and other vertebrates, as well as vegetable\r\nfat.They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference\r\nof adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of\r\nhuman skin oil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Linseed oil and related oils are\r\nimportant components of useful products used in oil paints and related\r\ncoatings. Linseed oil is rich in di- and tri-unsaturated fatty acid components,\r\nwhich tend to harden in the presence of oxygen. This heat-producing hardening\r\nprocess is peculiar to these so-called drying oils. It is caused by a\r\npolymerization process that begins with oxygen molecules attacking the carbon\r\nbackbone. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides are also split into\r\ntheir components via transesterification during the manufacture of biodiesel.\r\nThe resulting fatty acid esters can be used as fuel in diesel engines. The\r\nglycerin has many uses, such as in the manufacture of food and in the\r\nproduction of pharmaceuticals</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are many different types of\r\ntriglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The pancreatic lipase acts at the\r\nester bond, hydrolyzing the bond and \"releasing\" the fatty acid. In\r\ntriglyceride form, lipids cannot be absorbed by the duodenum. Fatty acids,\r\nmonoglycerides (one glycerol, one fatty acid), and some diglycerides are\r\nabsorbed by the duodenum, once the triglycerides have been broken down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the intestine, following the\r\nsecretion of lipases and bile, triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol\r\nand free fatty acids in a process called lipolysis. They are subsequently moved\r\nto absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines. The triglycerides are\r\nrebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with\r\ncholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons. These are excreted from the\r\ncells and collected by the lymph system and transported to the large vessels\r\nnear the heart before being mixed into the blood. Various tissues can capture\r\nthe chylomicrons, releasing the triglycerides to be used as a source of energy.\r\nLiver cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires\r\nfatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of\r\nthe triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As\r\nthe brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source (unless converted to a\r\nketone) the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose,\r\nvia gluconeogenesis by conversion into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and then into\r\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, for brain fuel when it is broken down. Fat cells\r\nmay also be broken down for that reason if the brain's needs ever outweigh the\r\nbody's.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides cannot pass through\r\ncell membranes freely. Special enzymes on the walls of blood vessels called\r\nlipoprotein lipases must break down triglycerides into free fatty acids and\r\nglycerol. Fatty acids can then be taken up by cells via the fatty acid\r\ntransporter (FAT).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides, as major\r\ncomponents of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an\r\nimportant role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat.\r\nThey contain more than twice as much energy (approximately 9 kcal/g or 38 kJ/g)\r\nas carbohydrates (approximately 4 kcal/g or 17 kJ/g)</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant.

Short chain partial glycerides are more strongly\r\npolar than long chain partial glycerides, and have excellent solvent properties\r\nfor many hard-to-solubilise drugs, making them valuable as excipients in\r\nimproving the formulation of certain pharmaceuticals.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in specific circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or irritation of the respiratory tract (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The low vapour pressure of silicone fluids make exposures to potentially harmful vapours unlikely. The vapours of a low molecular weight member of this family, hexamethyldisiloxane, were tolerated by guinea pigs at concentrations of 25000 ppm for 30 minutes without apparent ill-effect. Higher saturated vapour concentrations (39000-40000 ppm) produced death in 15-20 minutes; deaths appeared to occur as a result of respiratory failure as animals removed from exposure, prior to death, almost always survived. Although animal studies show that silicone fluids are removed very slowly from the lungs, their presence is not expected to produce adverse effects; exposure to aerosols is unlikely to result in damage to the health. When heated at high temperatures, the fumes and oxidation products of methyl silicones can be both irritating and produce toxic effects following inhalation. Massive exposures of heated silicone oil can produce central nervous system depression leading to death.</p> <p>Not normally a hazard due to non-volatile nature of product</p>",

Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>When the eyes of human subjects where exposed to silicone fluids, there was evidence of transitory conjunctival irritation within a few hours; this resolved within 24 hours. When applied to the eyes of rabbits, silicone fluids produced transitory irritation which lasted no longer than 48 hours. Injection into the various structures of the eye of animals produced corneal scarring, degenerative changes in the retina, foreign body reaction and cataracts.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Low molecular weight silicone fluids may exhibit solvent action and may produce skin irritation.</p>",

This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Animal studies with silicone fluids indicate that acute toxicity is very low; large doses are required to produce death. Some silicone fluids have a laxative action and may also produce central nervous system depression. Silicone fluids have been used for their defoaming and flatulence-reducing action in the gastrointestinal effect without any reported ill-effects.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
