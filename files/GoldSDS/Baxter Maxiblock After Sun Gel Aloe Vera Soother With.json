The high degree of\r\nbiodegradation (70% in 28 days) for sorbitan tetraester (CAS 228573-47-5), in\r\nspite of its poor water solubility, indicates that enzymatic cleavage of the\r\nmultiple ester linkage must be taking place in order to achieve the observed\r\nlevel of biodegradation. This would be consistent with the fact that fatty\r\nacids (e.g., oleic, stearic acid) arising from enzymatic ester bond cleavage of\r\nthe sorbitan esters would be expected to be rapidly biodegraded.

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in specific circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin contact may produce sensitisation in a small proportion of individuals. Covered patch testing resulted in a small percentage of subjects who displayed signs of allergic contact dermatitis (BIBRA Toxicology Profile, 1990). Triethanolamine has also been identified as the cause of erythematous vesicular lesions, eczema, non-allergic contact dermatitis and irritation amongst workers.</p> <p>Rabbits exposed percutaneously to toxic levels of triethanolamine showed sluggishness, unsteady gait and emaciation. Gross pathology consisted of discoloured lungs, thymus, spleen, kidneys, stomach and, gas and/ or liquid-filled intestines.</p> <p>Guinea pigs exposed dermally to triethanolamine (8 g/kg/day, 5 days/week applied to shaved and subsequently bandaged skin), died between the second and seventeenth application. Necrosis of the epithelium was observed. Kidneys and liver showed cloudy swelling and congestion; fatty changes were seen in the central ascini of the liver, and lung and adrenal congestion were observed.</p> <p>Clinical skin testing of cosmetic products containing around 5% diethanolamine showed mild skin irritation.</p> <p>There is a suggestion, in the biomedical literature, that the material may also be absorbed through the skin and special consideration should be given to the choice of personal protective gear.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p>",

DEA produces nervous system injury in dogs and rats. Heart and salivary gland lesions have also been seen in mice treated cutaneously with DEA and in mice receiving DEA in drinking water. Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids. They are excreted predominantly unchanged with a half-life of approximately one week. In the absence of sodium nitrite, no conversion to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines was observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Diethanolamine competitively inhibits the cellular uptake of choline, in vitro, and hepatic changes in choline homeostasis, consistent with choline deficiency, are observed in vivo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Many amines are potent skin and respiratory sensitisers and certain individuals especially those described as \"atopic\" (i.e. those predisposed to asthma and other allergic responses) may show allergic reactions when chronically exposed to alkanolamines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In a study with coconut diethanolamide, the National Toxicology Program (Technical Report Series 479), showed clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic and renal tubule neoplasms and in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis in males and females, ulcer in males, and parakeratosis and inflammation in females at the site of application and of follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland of males and females, were chemical related.</p>",

Calculated lifetimes for the reaction of d-limonene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals range from 0.3-2 h based on experimentally determined rate constants. \u00a0The oxidation of limonene may contribute to aerosol and photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>Calculated lifetimes for the night-time reaction of d-limonene with nitrate radicals range form 0.9 to 9 minutes. \u00a0The daytime atmospheric lifetime of d-limonene is estimated to range from 12 to 48 min. depending upon local hydroxyl rate and ozone concentrations. Products produced from hydroxy radical reaction with limonene are 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene, a keto-aldehyde, formaldehyde, 3-oxobutanal, glyoxal and a C10 dicarbonyl. The same carbonyls, along with formic acid and C8 and C9 carboxylic acids, \u00a0may form in reactions with ozone. Ozonolysis of limonene may also lead to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides, which have various toxic effects on plant cells and may damage forests.</p> <p>Products of ozonolysis include bis(hydroxmethyl)peroxide, a precursor to hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of d-limonene with ozone in the dark results in the formation of 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene and formaldehyde. Reactions with nitrogen oxides produce aerosol formation as well as lower molecular weight products such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone and peroxyacetyl nitrate.</p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>\u00a0When released to the ground limonene is expected to have low to very low mobility in soil based on its physicochemical properties. The soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) calculated on the basis of solubility (13.8 mg/l, 25 C) and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (4.23) ranges from 1030 and 4780. The Henry's law constant indicates that limonene will rapidly volatilise from both dry and moist soil; however its absorption to soil may slow the process.</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate</b>: In the aquatic environment, limonene is expected to evaporate to a significant extent owing \u00a0to its high volatility. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of limonene from a model river ( 1 m deep, flow 1 m/s and wind speed 3 m/s) is 3.4 h. Some limonene is expected to absorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation and bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Limonene does not have functional groups for hydrolysis and its cyclohexene ring and ethylene group are known to resist hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of limonene is not expected in terrestrial or in aquatic environments. The hydrolytic half-life of d-limonene is estimated to be &gt;1000 days. Biotic degradation of limonene has been shown with some species of microorganisms such as\u00a0<i>Penicillium digitatum, Corynespora cassiicola, Diplodia gossyppina</i>\u00a0and a soil strain of<i>\u00a0Pseudomonans sp (SL strain).\u00a0</i>Limonene is readily biodegradable (41-98% degradation by biological oxygen demand in 14 d) under aerobic conditions in a standard test (OECD 301 C \"Modified MITI Test (1)\", OECD, 1981a; MITI, 1992). Also in a test simulating aerobic sewage treatment (OECD 303 A \"Simulation Test - Aerobic Sewage Treatment: Coupled Units Test\"; OECD, 1981b), limonene disappeared almost completely (&gt;93.8%) during 14 days of incubation.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation has been assessed under anaerobic conditions; there was no indication of any metabolisms, possibly because of the toxicity to micro-organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>The bioconcentration factor, calculated on the basis of water solubility and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Kow) is 246-262, suggesting that limonene may bioaccumulate in fish and other aquatic species.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b>\u00a0Technical limonene is practically nontoxic to birds on a subacute dietary basis, and is slightly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates on an acute basis.\u00a0</p> <p>for d-limonene:</p> <p>LD50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 16 weeks old) oral &gt;2000 mg/kg</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 10 day old) dietary &gt;5620 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Anas platyrhynchos (Mallard duck, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 80 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 71.4-88.7 ppm); static /92% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 568 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 437-852 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>EC50 Daphnia magna (Water flea, &lt;24 hr old; intoxication, immobilization) 17 ppm/48 hr (95% confidence limit: 11-33 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 966 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 740-1652 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 38.5 mg/L/96 hr; flow through /from table/ LC50</p> <p>Leuciscus idus (Golden orfe) 32 mg/L/48 hr /Conditions of bioassay not specified in source examined</p> <p>The acute toxicity of \u00a0d-limonene ranges from slight to high for aquatic organisms. The lowest acute toxicity values (EC50 or LC50) identified were approximately 0.4 mg/litre for Daphnia (US EPA, 1990b) and 0.7 mg/litre for fish (US EPA, 1990a,b). The no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for</p> <p>green algae is approximately 4 mg/litre (US EPA, 1990a). The acute toxicity (EC50 or LC50) of dipentene to Daphnia and fish is about 50-70 times lower than that for d-limonene (US EPA, 1990b).

The two major hydroperoxides in auto-oxidised d-limonene, \u00a0are cis- and trans- limonene-2-hydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-p-mentha-6,8-diene). In photo-oxidised d-limonene, they represent a minor fraction. Hydroperoxides may bind to proteins of the skin to make antigens either via a radical mechanism or after reactions to give epoxides. The cross-reactivity between the epoxide limonene-1,2-oxide, a potent contact allergen, and the hydroperoxides is NOT significant, indicating different mechanisms of sensitisation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0d-Limonene was considered to be weakly carcinogenic for the mouse fore-stomach epithelium, but not tumour producing. In 13-week and 2-year gavage-studies, male rats showed a range of compound-related kidney lesions including exacerbation of age-related nephropathy, mineralisation in the renal medulla, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium overlying the renal papilla and proliferation of the renal tubular epithelium. Neoplasms were believed to be caused by progression to tubular cell hyperplasia to tubular cell adenomas and, with increasing size, to adenocarcinomas or carcinomas. The similarity of the nephrotoxicity caused by trichloroethylene and N-(4'-fluoro-4-biphenyl)acetamide, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate in rats and the species specific nature of the response suggests that degeneration and necrosis of convoluted tubules may be associated with the accumulation of alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G). Since a2u-G is a species and gender-specific protein that is causal for both the cytotoxic and carcinogenic response in male rats, extrapolation of d-limonene carcinogenicity data from rat studies to other species (including humans) is probably not warranted. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G; they do however produce other related low molecular weight proteins capable of binding chemicals that cause a2u-G nephropathy in rats but this does not necessarily connote human risk. The Risk Assessment Forum of the USA EPA concluded;</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0Male renal rat tumours arising as a result of a process involving a2u-G accumulation do not contribute to the qualitative weight-of-evidence that the chemical poses a human carcinogenic hazard. Such tumours are included in dose-response extrapolations for the estimation of human carcinogenic risk.\u00a0</li> <li>If the chemical induces a2u-G accumulation in male rats, the associated nephropathy is not to be used as an end-point for determining non-carcinogenic hazard.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><span style=\"color:black\">At least one phototoxic\r\nfurocoumarin (8-methoxypsoralen) has been shown to markedly enhance\r\nexperimental UV carcinogenesis.

Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) therapy can\r\nbe used to treat hyperproliferative skin disorders like psoriasis and certain\r\nkinds of skin cancer Unfortunately, PUVA treatment itself leads to a higher\r\nrisk of skin cancer. Despite the photocarcinogenic properties of psoralen it\r\nwas used as a tanning activator in sunscreens until 1996. Psoralens are used in\r\ntanning accelerators, because psoralen increases the skin\u2019s sensitivity to\r\nlight. Some patients have had severe skin loss after sunbathing with\r\npsoralen-containing tanning activators. Patients with lighter skin colour\r\nsuffer four times as much from the melanoma-generating properties of psoralens\r\nthan those with darker skin. Psoralens short term side effects include nausea,\r\nvomiting, erythrema, pruritis, xerosis, skin pain due to phototoxic damage of\r\ndermal nerve and may cause cutaneous and genital skin malignancies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Research on psoralen has\r\nhistorically focused on interactions with DNA and RNA (in particular, ICL\r\nformation). Psoralen, however, has also been shown to block signaling of the\r\nErbB2 receptor which is overexpressed in certain aggressive types of breast\r\ncancer</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The furocoumarins represent a\r\nclass of nonphotodymanic compounds which transfer the energy of their UV\r\nexcited state to target molecules thus producing a form of irritant contact\r\ndermatitis (non-immunological).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Furanocoumarins absorb UV\r\nradiation, putting electrons into higher energy levels. When returning to\r\nground levels, energy is retransmitted as light and the transference of energy\r\nfrom electrons to other molecules results in the phototoxic effect. According\r\nto the exact conditions (concentration of furocoumarin,\u00a0 magnitude of dose of\r\nUVA etc.), the phototoxic effect can manifest as covalent binding of\r\nfurocoumarin to DNA or cell protein constituents, or the production of damaging\r\nenergetic oxygen species., or the binding of photogenerated species to various\r\nreceptors etc. Physically this can result in skin pigmentation, erythema,\r\nedema, photo-irritation, photo-mutagenic events etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Furanocoumarins, especially 5-MOP\r\n&amp; 8-MOP, have historically been used for photochemoprotection, especially\r\nwith UVB sunscreens and several furocoumarin-containing essential oils, or\r\nfurocoumarins themselves show anti-carcinogenic effects\u00a0 Some essential oils\r\nhave useful anti-oxidant properties which can act against damaging reactive\r\noxygen species generated by skin exposed UV-light.

It is chemically related to imidazolidinyl urea which is used in the same way. Diazolidinyl urea acts as a formaldehyde releaser.|It is used in many cosmetics, skin care products, shampoos and conditioners, as well as a wide range of products including bubble baths, baby wipes and household detergents. Diazolidinyl urea is found in the commercially available preservative Germaben.|Commercial diazolidinyl urea is a mixture of different formaldehyde addition products including polymers|<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazoles have been frequently discovered as a vital component of\r\nnovel and structurally diverse natural products that exhibit a wide variety of\r\nbiological activities. The exceptional range of antitumour, antiviral, and\r\nantibiotic activities, as well as their presence in peptides, or ability to\r\nbind to proteins, DNA, and RNA, has directed numerous synthetic studies and new\r\napplications of these azole heterocycles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While other azole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of\r\nbioactive natural products, the imidazole ring occurs largely in the context of\r\nthe natural amino acid histidine. In addition, the imidazole ring appears as a\r\ncomponent of unnatural cyclic peptides and is used as an ester isostere in\r\npeptidomimetic studies. However, the applications of imidazole are not limited\r\nto the realm of peptides and peptidomimetics. Imidazoles are present in the\r\nlarge family of bromopyrrole-imidazole alkaloids isolated from marine sponges\r\nbased on the common metabolite oroidin that feature significant biological\r\nactivities. The imidazole ring is also present in the pilocarpine alkaloids, as\r\nwell as potential therapeutic agents for thrombosis, cancer, and inflammatory\r\ndiseases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Various compounds that possess an imidazoline or guanidinium\r\nmoiety, along with a number of chemically related compounds, elicit a variety\r\nof pharmacological effects on cardiovascular/cerebrovascular function,\r\nmetabolism, insulin secretion and ion transport. These compounds include the\r\nalpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, mixed alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist/alpha2-adrenoceptor\r\nantagonists and an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist and an ion transport\r\ninhibitor and other structurally related ligands. Although such ligands\r\ninteract with known receptor systems, some of their functional effects, such as\r\ntheir centrally-mediated effects on blood pressure and their ability to augment\r\nglucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, are\r\npharmacologically ill-defined. Indeed, several studies indicate that these\r\nmolecules interact with distinct imidazoline binding sites. These sites share\r\nthe common property of not recognizing endogenous agonists for known monoamine\r\nreceptors and exhibiting high affinity for selected compounds containing an\r\nimidazoline, guanidinium or structurally-related substituent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most bio-active derivatives bear a substituent (aryl or alkyl\r\ngroup) on the carbon between the nitrogen centres.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of substituted imidazoles are selective inhibitors of\r\nnitric oxide synthase, which makes them interesting drug targets in\r\ninflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system.\r\nOther biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the\r\ndownregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with\r\ntranslation initiation</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolines are biologically active pharmacophores and synthetic\r\nintermediates in medicinal chemistry.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for human fertility, on the basis that similar materials provide some evidence of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazole is structurally related\r\nto histamine and has been used as an antagonist to counteract the effects of\r\nexcess histamine found in certain induced physiological conditions (it\r\ntherefore acts as an antihistamine).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazoles have been reported to\r\ndisrupt male fertility through disruption of testicular function.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Certain imidazole fungicides\r\nprovoke histamine release by a non-immunological mechanism, induce airway\r\nconstriction in guinea-pigs and hence may be harmful to spray operators who\r\nmight inhale fungicide aerosols used for plant protection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazole fungicides inhibit the\r\ncytochrome P450 (CYP) complex, including the 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) enzyme\r\nrequired for ergosterol biosynthesis, in fungal cell membranes. In addition,\r\nintracellular accumulation of toxic methylated sterols occurs and the synthesis\r\nof triglycerides and phospholipids is altered. Disturbances in oxidative and\r\nperoxidative enzyme activities lead to an intracellular toxic concentration of\r\nhydrogen peroxide. As a result, intracellular organelle destruction then leads\r\nto cell necrosis. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">2-Methylimidazole decreased\r\nluteinising hormone secretion and tissue interstitial fluid testosterone\r\nconcentration two hours after injection into Sprague Dawley rats.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazoles bind to cytochrome\r\nP450 haeme, resulting in inhibition of catalysis. However, 2-substituted\r\nimidazoles are considered to be poor inhibitors. Imidazole is probably an\r\ninducer of cytochrome P4502E1. In general, inducers of this isozyme stabilise\r\nthe enzyme by preventing phosporylation of a serine which leads to haeme loss.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Several drugs containing an\r\nimidazole moiety were retained and bound in connective tissue when administered\r\nto laboratory animals.

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>When administered by inhalation, formaldehyde induced squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal cavity in rats of both sexes. Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p> <p>Respiratory sensitisation may result in allergic/asthma like responses; from coughing and minor breathing difficulties to bronchitis with wheezing, gasping.</p>",

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

In a further work there was no significant objective or subjective skin response to two 500-mg daily doses of benzoic acid or lactic acid in a double blind study of 150 dermatological patients</p> <p>Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after application of preparations containing p-hydroxybenzoates to the skin. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported following parenteral or oral administration. Cross-sensitivity occurs between the p-hydroxybenzoates. Hypersensitivity reactions may include acute bronchospasm, hives (urticaria), deep dermal wheals (angioneurotic oedema), running nose (rhinitis) and blurred vision. Anaphylactic shock and skin rash (non-thrombocytopenic purpura) may also occur.
