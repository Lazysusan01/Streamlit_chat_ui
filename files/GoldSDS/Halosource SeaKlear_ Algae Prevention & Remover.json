Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable taste; the lowest taste threshold concentration for sulfate is approximately 250 mg/litre as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems. No health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/litre.</p> <p>Sulfates are removed from the air by both dry and wet deposition processes. Wet deposition processes including rain-out (a process that occurs within the clouds) and washout (removal by precipitation below the clouds) contribute to the removal of sulfate from the atmosphere.</p> <p>In soil, the inorganic sulfates can adsorb to soil particles or leach into surface water and groundwater. Sulfates can be taken up by plants and be incorporated into the parenchyma of the plant.</p> <p>Sulfate in water can also be reduced by sulfate bacteria (<i>Thiobacilli</i>) which use them as a source of energy.</p> <p>In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle. Sodium sulfate is not reactive in aqueous solution at room temperature. Sodium sulfate will completely dissolve, ionise and distribute across the entire planetary \"aquasphere\". Some sulfates may eventually be deposited, the majority of sulfates participate in the sulfur cycle in which natural and industrial sodium sulfate are not distinguishable</p> <p>The BCF of sodium sulfate is very low and therefore significant bioconcentration is not expected. Sodium and sulfate ions are essential to all living organisms and their intracellular and extracellular concentrations are actively regulated. However some plants (e.g. corn and\u00a0<i>Kochia Scoparia</i>), are capable of accumulating sulfate to concentrations that are potentially toxic to ruminants.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For sulfate in general:</p> <p>Fish LC50: \u00a0toxic from 7000 mg/l</p> <p>Bacteria: toxic from \u00a02500 mg/l</p> <p>Algae were shown to be the most sensitive to sodium sulfate; EC50 120 h = 1,900 mg/l. For invertebrates\u00a0<i>(Daphnia magna)\u00a0</i>the EC50 48 h = 4,580 mg/l and fish appeared to be the least sensitive with a LC50 96h = 7,960 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>. Activated sludge showed a very low sensitivity to sodium sulfate. There was no effect up to 8 g/l. Sodium sulfate is not very toxic to terrestrial plants.\u00a0<i>Picea banksiana\u00a0</i>was the most sensitive species, an effect was seen at 1.4 g/l. Sediment dwelling organisms were not very sensitive either, with an LC50 96h = 660 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Trycorythus sp</i>. Overall it can be concluded that sodium sulfate has no acute adverse effect on aquatic and sediment dwelling organisms. Toxicity to terrestrial plants is also low.</p> <p>No data were found for long term toxicity. The acute studies all show a toxicity of sodium sulfate higher than 100 mg/l, no bioaccumulation is expected,</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In soil, copper levels are raised by application of fertiliser, fungicides, from deposition of highway dusts and from urban, mining and industrial sources. Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Exposure to copper, by skin, has come from its use in pigments, ointments, ornaments, jewellery, dental amalgams and IUDs and as an antifungal agent and an algicide. Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction. Copper salts often produce an itching eczema in contact with skin. This is, likely, of a non-allergic nature.</span></p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sulfate salts are poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract but because of osmotic activity are able to draw water from the lumen to produce diarrhoea (purging). Sulfate ion usually has little toxicological potential.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",

Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
