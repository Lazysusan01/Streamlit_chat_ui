The Henry's law constant for ethylene glycol is 1.41 \u00d7 10-3 or 6.08 \u00d7 10-3 Pa.m3/mol, depending on method of calculation, indicating a low capacity for volatilisation from water bodies or soil surfaces.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol adsorbed onto silica gel and irradiated with light (wavelength &gt;290 nm) degraded by 12.1% over 17 h . Photodegradation is not expected, as the molecule should not absorb at these wavelengths; the mechanism of this breakdown is, therefore, unknown. Estimated half-life in the atmosphere for reaction with hydroxyl radicals from various reports \u00a0is 2.1 days , 8-84 h \u00a0or 1 day.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol released to the atmosphere will be degraded by reaction with hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for the compound in this reaction has been estimated at between 0.3 and 3.5 days. No hydrolysis of ethylene glycol is expected in surface waters.</p>\n<p>The compound has little or no capacity to bind to particulates and will be mobile in soil. Soil partition coefficients (log Koc) of 0-0.62 were determined. Migration rates in five soil types were measured \u00a0at between 4 and 27 cm per 12 h</p>\n<p>The low octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow -1.93 to -1.36)and measured bioconcentration factors in a few organisms indicate low capacity for bioaccumulation. Bioconcentration factors of 190 for the green algae\u00a0(Chlorella fusca)\u00a0, up to 0.27 in specific tissues of the crayfish (\u00a0Procambarus\u00a0sp.) , and 10 for the golden orfe\u00a0(Leuciscus idus melanotus)\u00a0confirm low bioaccumulation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Ethylene glycol is readily biodegradable in standard tests using sewage sludge. Many studies show biodegradation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Some studies suggest a lag phase before degradation, but many do not. Degradation occurs in both adapted and unadapted sludges. Rapid degradation has been reported in surface waters (less in salt water than in fresh water), groundwater, and soil inocula. Several strains of microorganisms capable of utilising ethylene glycol as a carbon source have been identified.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol has been identified as a metabolite of the growth regulator ethylene in a number of higher plants and as naturally occurring in the edible fungus\u00a0Tricholoma matsutake</p>\n<p><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong></p>\n<p>Fish LC50 (96 h):118-550 mg/L</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol has generally low toxicity to aquatic organisms. Toxic thresholds for microorganisms are above 1000 mg/litre. EC50s for growth in microalgae are 6500 mg/litre or higher. Acute toxicity tests with aquatic invertebrates where a value could be determined show LC50s above 20 000 mg/litre, and those with fish show LC50s above 17 800 mg/litre. An amphibian test showed an LC50 for tadpoles at 17 000 mg/litre. A no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for chronic tests on daphnids of 8590 mg/litre (for reproductive end-points) has been reported. A NOEC following short-term exposure of fish has been reported at 15 380 mg/litre for growth. Tests using deicer containing ethylene glycol showed greater toxicity to aquatic organisms than observed with the pure compound, indicating other toxic components of the formulations. Laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have demonstrated toxic effects and death. Field studies in the vicinity of an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity. These effects cannot definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol. Terrestrial organisms are much less likely to be exposed to ethylene glycol and generally show low sensitivity to the compound. Concentrations above 100 000 mg/litre were needed to produce toxic effects on yeasts and fungi from soil. Very high concentrations and soaking of seeds produced inhibition of germination in some experiments; these are not considered of environmental significance. A no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for orally dosed ducks at 1221 mg/kg body weight and reported lethal doses for poultry at around 8000 mg/kg body weight indicate low toxicity to birds.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce severe damage to the health of the individual. Relatively small amounts absorbed through the lungs may prove fatal.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Strong evidence exists that exposure to the material may produce very serious irreversible damage (other than carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and teratogenesis) following a single exposure by swallowing.</p> <p>The toxic effects of glycols (dihydric alcohols), following ingestion are similar to those of alcohol, with depression of the central nervous system (CNS), nausea, vomiting and degenerative changes in liver and kidney.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>for ethylene glycol:</p> <p>Ingestion symptoms include respiratory failure, central nervous depression, cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary oedema, acute kidney failure, and even brain damage. Ingestion of 100 ml has caused death. (ChemInfo)</p> <p>Toxicity of ethylene glycol to human (KB) cell cultures has been reported as less than that of ethanol. (NIOSHTIC)</p> <p>Ethylene glycol produces a three-stage response with the severity of each stage dependent on the amount of ingestion. Hepatic damage is usually minimal. Central nervous system depression characterise the first 12 hours post ingestion.</p> <p>Transient exhilaration occurs without the odour of ethanol.</p> <p>Gastrointestinal complaints include nausea and vomiting. Acidosis, coma, convulsions and myoclonic jerks may also be evident. The optic fundus is usually normal although the presence of papilloedema may confuse the presentation with that produced by methanol. Nystagmus and opthalmoplegias may appear.</p> <p>Cardiopulmonary effects are seen 12-24 hours post-ingestion and are characterised by tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypertension. Congestive heart failure and circulatory collapse may occur in severe intoxications.</p> <p>Renal effects are seen 24-72 hours post-ingestion and are characterised by oliguria, flank pain, acute tubular necrosis, renal failure, and rarely, bone marrow arrest. Renal damage may be permanent.</p> <p>Toxic effects of ethylene glycol are similar to those produced by ethanol but ethylene glycol produces toxic metabolites. Metabolic acidosis and anion gap result primarily from glycolic acid formation and some lactic</p> <p>acid formation. The citric acid cycle is inhibited as a result of reduced NAD/NADH ratios and to a limited extent, the formation of oxalic acid, and to metabolic acidosis. Oxalate formation produces myocardial depression and acute tubular necrosis. Glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid may contribute to CNS depression and may also produce renal toxicity by producing renal oedema. Hypocalcaemia may result from chelation by oxalate. Oxalic acid, glycoxalic acid, glycoaldehyde and formic acid appear to form to only a limited degree during intoxication.</p> <p>Oral administration to pregnant mice and rats produced birth defects amongst the off-spring.</p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>There is some evidence to provide a presumption that human exposure to the material may result in impaired fertility on the basis of: \u00a0some evidence in animal studies of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which is not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Human volunteers exposed to ethylene glycol, 20 to 22 hours/day at mean daily concentrations ranging form 1.4 to 27 ppm for about 4 weeks complained of throat irritation, mild headache and low backache. Complaints became marked when the concentration in the exposure chamber was raised above 56 mg/m3 for part of the day. The most common complaint was irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Concentrations above 80 ppm were intolerable with a burning sensation along the trachea and a burning cough. Excessively exposed workers have reported drowsiness.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p>",
