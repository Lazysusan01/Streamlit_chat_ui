A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

However the material may be absorbed in potentially harmful amounts when applied in large quantities to severe burns (second or third degree) over large areas of the body as part of a cream, other topical application or by prolonged contact with clothing accidentally wetted by the material.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The toxic effects of glycols (dihydric alcohols), following ingestion are similar to those of alcohol, with depression of the central nervous system (CNS), nausea, vomiting and degenerative changes in liver and kidney.</p> <p>Ingestion of propylene glycol produced reversible central nervous system depression in humans following ingestion of 60 ml. Symptoms included increased heart-rate (tachycardia), excessive sweating (diaphoresis) and grand mal seizures in a 15 month child who ingested large doses (7.5 ml/day for 8 days) as an ingredient of vitamin preparation.</p> <p>Excessive repeated ingestions may cause hypoglycaemia (low levels of glucose in the blood stream) among susceptible individuals; this may result in muscular weakness, incoordination and mental confusion.\u00a0</p> <p>Very high doses given during feeding studies to rats and dogs produce central nervous system depression (although one-third of that produced by ethanol), haemolysis and insignificant kidney changes.</p> <p>In humans propylene glycol is partly excreted unchanged in the urine and partly metabolised as lactic and pyruvic acid. Lactic acidosis may result.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Propylene glycol is though, by some, to be a sensitising principal following the regular use of topical creams by eczema patients. A study of 866 persons using a formulation containing propylene glycol in a patch test indicated that propylene glycol caused primary irritation in 16% of exposed individuals probably caused by dehydration. Undiluted propylene glycol was tested on 1556 persons in a 24 hour patch test. 12.5% showed reactions which were largely toxic (70%) or allergic in nature (30%). Reaction responses reached their maximum on the second day or later. Reactions were seasonal in nature ranging from 17.8% in winter to 9.2% in other seasons. In a patch-test using 25 standard allergens conducted on 500 individuals, propylene glycol ranked fourth in sensitising response. 84 subjects were patch tested using 100% propylene glycol. as well as 2% and 5% in water. With undiluted material, 15% demonstrated a reaction, with 40% of the reactions being allergic in nature and 60% being irritant. In dilute solutions 5 of 248 subjects exhibited a reaction.</p> <p>Undiluted propylene glycol tested on the skin of man produced no irritation under open conditions but when applied under occlusive conditions, for 2 weeks, it produced severe erythema, oedema and vesicles, probably due to sweat retention and weak primary irritation.</p> <p>Predictive contact skin sensitisation tests indicate that propylene glycol is an intermediate grade sensitiser with an index of 1% of tested subjects.</p> <p>\u00a0Groups of cats fed 5 gm/kg/day of propylene glycol for 14 weeks showed a significant dose-related increase in red blood cell Heinz body formation without any marked signs of haemolytic anaemia. The no-effect-level for cats without formation of Heinz bodies is 100-500 ml/kg. There is no evidence of anaemia or degenerative change. Groups of rats dosed orally with 0.5 or 10 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks had lowered food intake but no adverse effects on body weights. Erythrocytes were more fragile. Heinz bodies were not apparent.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
