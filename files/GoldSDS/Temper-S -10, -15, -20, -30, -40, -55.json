Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>metal oxides</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Potassium poisoning disturbs the rhythm of the heart (a slow, weak pulse, heightened T waves on the ECG, arrhythmias heart block) and eventually produces a fall in blood pressure (due to weakened cardiac contractility). Respiration is initially accelerated but skeletal muscle weakness may bring to the stage of paralysis. Orally poisoned animals die from respiratory failure, sometimes following convulsion and gastroenteritis, dehydration of organs and early kidney damage (renal tubular necrosis). Survivors may develop loss of appetite (anorexia), excessive thirst (polydipsia), increase volumes of urine (polyuria), fever, convulsive movements and gastric disturbances within the first 24 hours; rapid recovery occurs thereafter.</p> <p>Formate ion is extensively oxidised in vivo but may directly act on the brain to produce convulsions.
