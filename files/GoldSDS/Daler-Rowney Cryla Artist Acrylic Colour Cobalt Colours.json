Adsorption of cobalt onto\r\niron and manganese increases with pH. In addition, as pH increases, insoluble\r\nhydroxides or carbonates may form, which would also reduce cobalt mobility.\r\nConversely, sorption onto mobile colloids would enhance its mobility.

Soil and plant samples taken in the 30-km zone around\r\nChernobyl indicated that 60Co was not accumulated by plants and mushrooms.\r\nStudies investigating the uptake of 60Co by tomato plants watered with 60Co\r\ncontaminated water showed that tomato plants absorbed &lt;2% of the activity\r\navailable from the soil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>60Co is taken up by phytoplankton and unicellular algae\r\n(Senenastrum capricornutum) with concentration factors (dry weight) ranging\r\nfrom 15,000 to 40,000 and 2,300 to 18,000, respectively. Elimination\r\nexperiments with the algae indicate a two component biological half-life, 1\r\nhour and 11 days, respectively, and suggest that the cobalt might be absorbed\r\nnot only on the surface, but also intracellularly. Since these organisms are at\r\nthe bottom of the food chain, they could play an important role in the trophic\r\ntransfer of 60Co released into waterways by nuclear facilities. However, cobalt\r\nlevels generally diminish with increasing trophic levels in a food chain. The\r\nlow levels of cobalt in fish may also reflect cobalt's strong binding to\r\nparticles and sediment. The bioaccumulation factors (dry weight basis) for\r\ncobalt in marine and freshwater fish are ~100-4,000 and &lt;10-1,000,\r\nrespectively; accumulation in the muscle of marine fish is 5- 500.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Cobalt largely accumulates in the viscera and on the skin, as\r\nopposed to the edible parts of the fish. In carp, accumulation from water\r\naccounted for 75% of 60Co accumulated from both water and food; accumulation\r\nfrom water and food was additive. Depuration half-lives were 53 and 87 days for\r\nfish contaminated from food and water, respectively. In the case of an\r\naccidental release of 60Co into waterways, the implication is that effects\r\nwould manifest themselves rapidly since the primary route of exposure is from\r\nwater rather than food. Uptake of 60Co was very low in whitefish, with\r\nconcentrations being highest in kidney and undetectable in muscle. Similarly,\r\nwhile accumulation of 60Co by carp from food was dependent on food type, the\r\ntransfer factor was very low, approximately 0.01, and no long-term\r\nbioaccumulation of the radionuclide occurred.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Concentration factors have also been reported for various other\r\naquatic organisms. Freshwater mollusks have concentration factors of 100-14,000\r\n(~1-300 in soft tissue). Much of the cobalt taken up by mollusks and crustacae\r\nfrom water or sediment is adsorbed to the shell or exoskeleton; very little\r\ncobalt is generally accumulated in the edible parts. A concentration factor for\r\n60Co of 265 mL/g (wet weight) was determined for Daphnia magna in laboratory\r\nstudies. The rapid decrease in radioactivity during the depuration phase\r\nindicated that adsorption to the surface was the major contamination process.\r\nHowever, the digestive glands of crustaceans, which are sometimes eaten by\r\nhumans, may accumulate high levels of 60Co. The shell accounted for more than\r\nhalf of the body burden.

Exposure to 9 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt hydrocarbonyl for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 months resulted in 16 deaths out of 75 rats. Death was reported in rats and mice exposed to 19 mg cobalt/m3 (but not 1.9 mg cobalt/m3) as cobalt sulfate over 16 days, but exposure to 11.4 mg cobalt/m3 over 13 weeks was lethal only to mice and not to rats. Exposure to 1.14 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt sulfate for 104 weeks resulted in no increase in mortality in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Inhalation of stable cobalt by humans and/or animals resulted in respiratory, cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, renal, endocrine, ocular, and body weight effects. As with exposures in humans, exposures of animals to cobalt-containing aerosols have resulted in pronounced respiratory effects. Animals exposed to aerosols of cobalt oxides and cobalt sulfate developed respiratory effects that varied in severity with exposure level and duration. A single 30-minute exposure of rats to relatively high levels (26-236 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt hydrocarbonyl) resulted in congestion, edema, and hemorrhage of the lung. Prolonged exposure (3-4 months) of rats and rabbits to mixed cobalt oxides (0.4-9 mg cobalt/m3) resulted in lesions in the alveolar region of the respiratory tract characterised histologically by nodular accumulation of Type II epithelial cells, accumulations of enlarged highly vacuolated macrophages, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis In at least one instance, the lesions appeared to regress when exposure was terminated . Guinea pigs sensitized to cobalt by repeated dermal application and then exposed to 2.4 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt chloride showed pulmonary inflammatory changes (altered BAL fluid recovery, increased neutrophils and eosinophils in the recovered BAL fluid) that were different than those in exposed animals not sensitised to cobalt. Decreased lung compliance was found in pigs exposed to 0.1 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt dust for 3 months. Lifetime exposure of hamsters to 7.9 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt oxide resulted in emphysema. Necrosis and inflammation of the respiratory tract epithelium (nasal turbinates, larynx, trachea, bronchioles) were reported in rats exposed to 19 mg cobalt/m3 and mice exposed to 1.9 mg cobalt/m3 or greater as cobalt sulfate over 16 days. Exposure of rats and mice to cobalt as cobalt sulfate for 13 weeks resulted in adverse effects on all parts of the respiratory tract, with the larynx being the most sensitive part</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of freshly formed metal oxide particles sized below 1.5 microns and generally between 0.02 to 0.05 microns may result in \"metal fume fever\". Symptoms may be delayed for up to 12 hours and begin with the sudden onset of thirst, and a sweet, metallic or foul taste in the mouth. Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur. Tolerance to the fumes develops rapidly, but is quickly lost. All symptoms usually subside within 24-36 hours following removal from exposure.</p>",

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>In general, available cohort studies in humans have not reported a significant increase in total mortality as a result of cobalt exposure. Several studies have noted increased mortality rates resulting from lung cancer following occupational exposure to cobalt, either as a mixture of cobalt compounds or as hard metal, a metal alloy with a tungsten carbide and cobalt matrix. \u00a0Fatal cases of hard metal disease and cardiomyopathy believed to have resulted from occupational cobalt exposure have also been reported. However, in the majority of these and other reported occupational studies, co-exposure to other substances was common, and was unable to be corrected for in the analysis.</p> <p>The effects of chronic occupational exposure to cobalt and cobalt compounds on the respiratory system in humans are well-documented. These effects include respiratory irritation, diminished pulmonary function, wheezing, asthma, pneumonia, and fibrosis and occurred at exposure levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.893 mg cobalt/m3 (exposure from 2 to 17 years). These effects have been observed in workers employed in cobalt refineries, as well as hard metal workers, diamond polishers, and ceramic dish painters (painting with cobalt blue dye).</p> <p>Occupational asthma attributed to the inhalation of cobalt powder has been confirmed following bronchial challenge tests. Chest tightness and chronic bronchitis have been recorded in hard-metal workers exposed to cobalt. Cobalt is known to function as a hapten, resulting in the generation of antibodies against cobalt-protein complexes. Although the minimum exposure level associated with cobalt sensitisation has not been determined, sensitisation has been demonstrated in hard metal workers with work-related asthma who have experienced prolonged occupational exposure (&gt;3 years) to levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.893 mg cobalt/m3. The sensitisation phenomenon includes the production of IgE and IgA antibodies to cobalt. Exposure to inhaled cobalt chloride aerosols can precipitate an asthmatic attack in sensitised individuals believed to be the result of an allergic reaction within the lungs.</p> <p>Allergic dermatitis of an erythematous papular type may also occur following occupational exposure. Dermatitis is a common result of dermal exposure to cobalt in humans that has been verified in a large number of studies. Using patch tests and intradermal injections, it has been demonstrated that the dermatitis is probably caused by an allergic reaction to cobalt. Contact allergy was reported in 22 of 223 (9.9%) nurses who were tested with a patch test of 1.0% cobalt chloride as well as 16 of 79 (20.3%) of examined dentists. Persons with body piercings showed an increased prevalence of allergy to cobalt, with the incidence of contact allergy being proportional to number of piercings The prevalence of sensitivity to cobalt following exposure to cobalt as a component of metal implants is low, with only 3.8% of patients developing a new sensitivity to cobalt following insertion of the implant</p> <p>Exposure levels associated with the development of dermatitis have not been identified. It appears that the allergic properties of cobalt result mainly from exposure to the metal itself, rather than a salt, as it has been demonstrated that daily repeated exposure to aqueous cobalt salts did not result in hand eczema in patients known to have cobalt allergy.</p> <p>Occupational exposure to cobalt in humans has been reported to cause several effects on the nervous system, including memory loss , nerve deafness, and a decreased visual acuity. It should be noted though, that both of the studies reporting on these findings, \u00a0had small numbers of subjects, and exposure characterization was not reported.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to cobalt produces polycythaemia (increase in blood haemoglobin), increased production of cells of the bone marrow and thyroid gland, pericardial effusion and damage to the alpha cells of the pancreas. Chronic exposure to cobalt compounds may result in pericardial effusion, polycardial effusion, cardiac failure, vomiting, convulsions and thyroid enlargement.</p> <p>Chronic administration of cobaltous chloride has produced goiter, reduced thyroid activity and lowered synthesis rates and levels of cytochrome P-450, an enzymatic system responsible for chemical detoxification, in the liver. \u00a0A toxic nephritis (kidney disease) may also develop.</p> <p>Epidemic cardiomyopathy (heart disease) among heavy beer drinkers in the 1960's in Canada, the USA and Belgium has been attributed to the addition of up to 1.5 ppm of cobalt as a foam restorative and stabiliser. Other factors are probably implicated as therapeutic doses of cobalt, up to 50 mg/day (in the treatment of refractory anaemias) do not produce this effect. Inadequate protein or vitamin intake amongst heavy drinkers, or the effects of alcohol in rendering the heart more susceptible to disease may be important.</p> <p>\u00a0Single and repeated subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of cobalt powder and salts to rats may cause sarcoma at the injection site but evidence for carcinogenicity by any other route of exposure does not exist. A number of single cases of malignant tumours, mostly sarcomas, have been reported at the site of orthopedic implants containing cobalt.</p> <p>\u00a0Animals, exposed to cobalt compounds also exhibit an increase in respiration, as well as tremor and convulsion. Exposure of rats and mice to aerosols of cobalt (as cobalt sulfate) at concentrations from 0.11 to 1.14 mg cobalt/m3 for 2 years resulted in a spectrum of inflammatory, fibrotic, and proliferative lesions in the respiratory tract of male and female rats and mice. Squamous metaplasia of the larynx occurred in rats and mice at exposure concentrations of .0.11 mg cobalt/m3, with severity of the lesion increasing with increased cobalt concentration. Hyperplastic lesions of the nasal epithelium occurred in rats at concentrations of .0.11 mg cobalt/3, and in mice at concentrations of .0.38 mg cobalt/m3. Both sexes of rats had greatly increased incidences (&gt;90% incidence) of alveolar lesions at all exposure levels, including inflammatory changes, fibrosis, and metaplasia. Similar changes were seen in mice at all exposure levels, though the changes in mice were less severe.</p> <p>\u00a0Cobalt metal dust inhalations by miniature swine resulted in early marked decrease in lung compliance and increases in septal collagen. After a one-week \"sensitising period\", followed by a 10-day lapse period, further exposures resulted in wheezing produced by hypersensitivity reactions.</p> <p>Sensitisation may give severe responses to very low levels of exposure, in situations where exposure may occur.</p>",
