Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints. MATC values represent an approximate\r\nthreshold of chronic effects to an organism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overall these studies show that acrylic acid and the acrylic\r\nesters studied can rapidly biodegrade, have a low potential for persistence or\r\nbioaccumulation in the environment, and have low to moderate toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">C.

Product should be consumed in its entirety after heating/ melting; avoid multiple \"reheats\" which may affect product quality or result in product degradation.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Product should be packaged with inhibitor(s). Unless inhibited, product may polymerise, raising temperature and pressure, possibly rupturing container. Check inhibitor level periodically, adding to bulk material if needed. In addition, the product's inhibitor(s) require the presence of dissolved oxygen. Maintain, at a minimum, the original headspace in the product container and do NOT blanket or mix with oxygen-free gas as it renders the inhibitor ineffective. Ensure air space (oxygen) is present during product heating / melting.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Store product indoors at temperatures greater than the product's freeing point (or greater than 0 deg. C.

Compounds with a log Pow &gt;5\r\nexhibit simple narcosis, but at lower log Pow the toxicity of acrylates is\r\ngreater than predicted for simple narcotics.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">If released to surface water, acrylic acid and the acrylic esters\r\nwould all be rapidly biodegraded while a portion would volatilise to the air.\r\nAcrylic acid was shown to rapidly biodegrade aerobically in soil (<i>t</i>1/2\r\n&lt; 1 day). Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints. MATC values represent an approximate\r\nthreshold of chronic effects to an organism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overall these studies show that acrylic acid and the acrylic\r\nesters studied can rapidly biodegrade, have a low potential for persistence or\r\nbioaccumulation in the environment, and have low to moderate toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">C.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <p>General warning: Do NOT use latex gloves!

Compounds with a log Pow &gt;5\r\nexhibit simple narcosis, but at lower log Pow the toxicity of acrylates is\r\ngreater than predicted for simple narcotics.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">If released to surface water, acrylic acid and the acrylic esters\r\nwould all be rapidly biodegraded while a portion would volatilise to the air.\r\nAcrylic acid was shown to rapidly biodegrade aerobically in soil (<i>t</i>1/2\r\n&lt; 1 day). Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints. MATC values represent an approximate\r\nthreshold of chronic effects to an organism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overall these studies show that acrylic acid and the acrylic\r\nesters studied can rapidly biodegrade, have a low potential for persistence or\r\nbioaccumulation in the environment, and have low to moderate toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">C.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints. MATC values represent an approximate\r\nthreshold of chronic effects to an organism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overall these studies show that acrylic acid and the acrylic\r\nesters studied can rapidly biodegrade, have a low potential for persistence or\r\nbioaccumulation in the environment, and have low to moderate toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">C.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
