On the environmental fate side, this includes standard biodegradation studies, advanced simulation studies of removal in treatment systems, and field monitoring data. On the environmental effects side, acute as well as chronic single-species data are available, as well as advanced studies in micro- and mesocosm systems.</p> <p>By means of these higher tier exposure and effects data, it could be shown that the use of AES in household detergents and cleaning products results in risk characterization ratios less than one, indicating no concern, for all environmental compartments.</p> <p>The most frequent initial step in the biodegradation of AES is the cleavage of an ether bond.. The cleavage may take place at any ether bond producing a fatty alcohol or an alcohol ethoxylate and ethylene glycol sulfates of various lengths.. The length of the alkyl chain and the number of EO units apparently do not affect the degree of aerobic biodegradation, but branching of the alkyl chain may hinder the primary biodegradation of AES. AES are degraded readily and completely under aerobic conditions. E.g., for C12-14 AE3S, a rapid primary degradation of 90-100% is reported to take place within a period of 1 to 5 days. In activated sludge simulation tests 67-99% DOC was removed by degradation of C12-14 AE2S and C12-15 AE3S. The ultimate biodegradation of AES has been confirmed in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability.</p> <p>Based on at least one study, AES are not considered to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The chemical structure of AES highly influences the effect on aquatic organisms. The relations between alkyl chain length, number of EO groups and toxicity are complex and not yet resolved, but in general, changes in EO numbers affects toxicity more than changes in the alkyl chain length. In AES with alkyl chains of less than C16, the toxicity tended to decrease with increasing numbers of EO, but this was reversed for alkyl chain lengths above C16. The toxicity of AES thus seems to peak at alkyl chain lengths of C16. In a study of the acute toxicity of various AES (C8 to C19.6 and 1-3 EO) to bluegill sunfish (<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>), the LC50 fell from &gt; 250 mg/l for C8 and 375 mg/l for C10 to 24 mg/l for C13, 4-7 mg/l for C14, 2 mg/l for C15 and 0.3 mg/l for C16, and then increased to 10.8 mg/l for C17.9 and 17 mg/l for C19.6. Reported ranges for EC50 for the acute toxicity of AES to daphnids between 1 and 50 mg/l. However, an EC50 of 0.37 mg/l was observed in a 21-day reproduction test with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna.\u00a0</i>The LC50 values for fish are in the range between 0.39 to 450 mg/l. A LOEC value of 0.22 mg/l has been reported for a chronic life cycle test with a duration of 1 year. The toxicity of AES towards fish seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length for AES with up to 16 carbons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood - local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. \u00a0Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). \u00a0Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. \u00a0The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. \u00a0Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

In addition they function as hair conditioning agents,\r\nfunctional surfactants, thickeners and bacteriostatic agents.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Amphoteric surfactants\r\n(amphiphiles) have dual functional groups (both acidic and basic groups) in the\r\nsame molecule. They are polar substances that have a high solubility in water\r\nbut a poor solubility in most organic solvents. They are electrically neutral\r\n(zwitterions) but carry positive and negative charges on different atoms in an\r\naqueous solution. They exist mostly as zwitterions in a certain pH range but\r\ndepending on the pH value, the substances can have anionic or cationic\r\nproperties outside the zwitterionic range. In the presence of acids, they will\r\naccept the hydrogen ions but they will donate hydrogen ions to the solution in\r\nthe presence of bases, which balances the pH. Such actions make buffer\r\nsolutions which resist change to the pH. Amphoteric (amphiphilic) surfactants\r\nchange their charge according to the pH of the solution; this affects\r\nproperties such as foaming, wetting and detergency through a surface action that\r\nexerts both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. In biochemistry amphoteric\r\nsurfactants are used as\u00a0 detergents for purifying, cleansing and for their\u00a0\r\nantimicrobial effects. Alkylbetaines and amino-oxides are typical amphoteric\r\nsurfactants.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines are primarily used in\r\npersonal care products like, e.g. hair shampoos, liquid soaps, and cleansing\r\nlotions. Other applications include all-purpose cleaning agents, hand\r\ndishwashing agents, and special textile detergents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In chemistry a betaine is any\r\nneutral chemical compound with a positively charged cationic functional group\r\nsuch as a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation (generally: onium ions)\r\nwhich bears no hydrogen atom and with a negatively charged functional group\r\nsuch as a carboxylate group which may not be adjacent to the cationic site. A\r\nbetaine thus may be a specific type of zwitterion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In biological systems, many\r\nnaturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized\r\nor taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic\r\nstress, drought, high salinity or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation\r\nof betaines, non-perturbing to enzyme function, protein structure and membrane\r\nintegrity, permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects\r\nof dehydration. It is also a methyl donor of increasingly recognised\r\nsignificance in biology.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines may function to reduce\r\nthe concentration of homocysteine, a homolog of the naturally occurring amino\r\nacid cysteine. High circulating levels of homocysteine may be harmful to blood\r\nvessels and thus contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. This\r\nhypothesis is controversial as it has not yet been established whether\r\nhomocysteine itself is harmful or is just an indicator of increased risk for\r\ncardiovascular disease</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phosphonium betaines are\r\nintermediates in the Wittig reaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The addition of betaine to\r\npolymerase chain reactions improves the amplification of DNA by reducing the\r\nformation of secondary structure in GC-rich regions. The addition of betaine\r\nhas been reported to enhance the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction\r\nby eliminating the base pair composition dependence of DNA melting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most betaines are characterized\r\nby a fully quaternised nitrogen. In alkyl betaines, one of the methyl groups in\r\nthe \u2018betaine\u2019 structure (<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylglycine) is replaced by a linear\r\nalkyl chain. A special type of betaines is the hydroxysulfobetaines in which\r\nthe carboxylic group of alkyl betaine is replaced by sulfonate and a\r\nhydroxy-group is inserted in the hydrophilic part of the molecule. In\r\nalkylamido betaines, an amide group is inserted as a link between the\r\nhydrophobic alkyl chain and the hydrophilic moiety. The most commonly used\r\nalkylamido betaine is alkylamidopropyl betaine (e.g., cocoamidopropyl betaine),\r\nwhereas alkylamidoethyl betaines are used in smaller amounts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Representative structures include</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RN+(CH3)2CH2COO- (alkyl betaine)\r\nand </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RC(=O)NH(CH3)2N+(CH3)CH3-COO-\r\n(alkylamidopropyl betaine)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines and closely related\r\nsultaines are \"pseudo-amphoteric\" surfactants as the nitrogen moiety\r\nalways has a net positive charge and the molecules can never become anionic at\r\nhigh pHs</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines/ sultaines typically\r\ncontain 6-8% salt (as sodium chloride for example) as by-products of their\r\nsynthesis. These salts act to enlarge the effective size of the surfactant\r\nmicelles and thus viscosity increases</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since betaines/ sultaines\r\npermanently have positively charged nitrogen, the negatively charged end of the\r\nanionic surfactant associates with it to form a large surfactant complex and\r\nthe viscosity increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These surfactants also have other\r\nbenefits when used in shampoos; they improve foam and can increase hair\r\nconditioning due to their substantively to hair. It has also been reported\r\n(controversially) that they can actually decrease the irritation potential of\r\nanionics (once again due to the formation of a surfactant complex) </span></p>",

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For cationic surfactants:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Although cationic surfactants will sorb onto sludge particles and eventually reach the digester during the treatment of wastewater sludge, there is very limited information about the biodegradability of these compounds under anoxic conditions. It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.\u00a0</p> <p>The numerous studies of aquatic toxicity, many of which were conducted in natural waters with and without added effluents, indicate that the source and composition of the test water dramatically affects the toxicity of the test substance. These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants.\u00a0</p> <p>Zwitterionic (amphoteric) substances, such as betaines, sulfobetaines  and taurines, may be phytotoxic. Because they are implicated in the  disruption of cell membranes,\u00a0 toxic effects on marine flora and fauna  (of a secondary nature) may ensue.<br />Surfactants show a complex  solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer concentration, and  hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting value at the  critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains approximately constant  as the total concentration is further increased. For ecotoxicological  models requiring a solubility value, the critical micelle concentration  is therefore the appropriate parameter describing water solubility of  surface active materials<br />Surfactants can form dispersions or  emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic toxicity studies is  difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution preparation. Micelle  formation can result in an overestimation of the bioavailable fraction  even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This presents significant  problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test results for surface  active materials. The so-called the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  is related to surface tension produced by the\u00a0 substance and is key  value for actual water solubility of the substance.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The primary biodegradability of betaines approaches 100% as, e.g., the loss of surface-activity attained 100% for C12 alkyl betaine, 98% for cocoamidopropyl betaine, and 96 and 100% for C14-15 hydroxysulfobetaine. The results from ultimate biodegradability tests of alkyl betaines show some variation with degradation percentages below and above the pass level for ready biodegradability. However, taken as a whole, \u00a0both alkyl betaines and cocoalkylamido betaines can be regarded as readily biodegradable. In contrast the hydroxysulfobetaines are probably not readily biodegradable in standard screening tests as indicated by a biodegradability of 40 and 47% of ThOD in the closed bottle test.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The knowledge about the biodegradability of betaines under anoxic conditions is relatively scarce. \u00a0Literature searches indicates that sulfate-reducing marine bacteria belonging to the genus\u00a0<i>Desulfobacterium</i>\u00a0are able to grow on betaine with the stoichiometric formation of\u00a0<i>N,N</i>-dimethylglycine. One study indicated that betaine was anaerobically degraded to methylamine in sewage sludge at a betaine concentration of 2 g/l and a solids concentration of 3.3 g/l. The anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine was examine by using the ISO 11734 screening test. Under the methanogenic test conditions, the ultimate biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine attained 45 and 75% of ThGP after 28 and 56 days, respectively, at the applied test concentration of 14.4 mg C/l\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of betaines varies considerably, even within the same species, which is particularly evident by evaluating the EC50 values determined for the green alga\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus</i>. For this species, the EC50 obtained in tests with cocoamidopropyl betaine are between 0.55 and 48 mg/l. The geometric mean of the EC50 obtained for\u00a0<i>S. subspicatus\u00a0</i>is 3.1 mg/l, when the values 0.55, 1.84, and 30 mg/l are used . The EC/LC50 of alkyl and cocoamidopropyl betaines towards crustaceans and fish are between 1 and 100 mg/l.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

It has been suggested that these surfactants (typically betaines and sulfobetaines) may solubilise stratum corneum lipids. Studies confirm that dermal LD50s of certain substances may be reduced in the presence of these surfactants.

Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure. Cloudy swelling, patchy necrosis and fatty infiltration in such visceral organs as the heart, liver and kidneys shows at death.</p> <p>\u00a0Rats fed repeatedly on a similar material (a C12-C16 alkyl derivative), over several weeks, died of inanition associated with chronic diarrhoea; at autopsy the only lesion found was focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the gastric mucosa.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism.

Therefore, read-across  of exposure-related observations in humans from CAS 683-10-3 is  justified. Data from several human closed patch tests demonstrate skin  irritation in humans ranging from mild to strong under occlusive  conditions even with concentrations as low as 1%. In contrast, exposure  to 0.1% under open conditions did not induce any positive skin  reactions. <br />Information on skin sensitisation in humans is available  from a closed human patch test with CAS 683-10-3. After an induction  period of 6 days with 0.1% of active ingredient, followed by a  treatment-free period of 10 days, the volunteers were challenged under  occlusive conditions for 24 hours. No reactions were observed  immediately after challenge; during the next 4 days only irritation  reactions were observed. <br />This finding was further supported by  industrial medical monitoring data.\u00a0 Workers involved in the production  of CAS 683-10-3 are routinely checked every 3 years for signs of skin  sensitisation, respiratory irritation, skin irritation and eye  irritation. During these examinations no signs of the aforementioned  disorders were observed which were related to the test substance. <br />Moreover,  a study focusing on dermal uptake of C12-alkyldimethyl betaine) into  human skin and the effects of surfactants on skin barrier function  demonstrated that only up to 0.4% of the applied dose was absorbed  within 30 minutes of exposure, with absorbance being dependent on the  concentration applied. Tape stripping of the skin revealed that the  administered test substance was primarily located in the outer stratum  corneum layer<br />Test material does not demonstrate mutagenic or clastogenic effects in bacteria or mammalian cells in vitro<br />\" REACH Dossier<br />Amphoteric  surfactants are easily absorbed in the intestine and are excreted  partly unchanged via the faeces. Metabolisation to CO2 and short-chained  fatty acids also occur. No tendency to accumulation in the organism or  storage of betaines in certain organs has been detected. Betaines  generally have a low acute toxicity. E.g., LD50 values for  cocoamidopropylbetaine (30% solution) by oral administration have been  determined to 4,910 mg/kg body weight in rats.<br />Betaines do not carry  any net charge, and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds  with proteins in the skin. This may be the explanation for the low  protein denaturation potential of betaines as the ion-binding of other  surfactants contributes to denaturation. In combination with anionic  surfactants a positive synergistic effect with regard to skin  compatibility is often found. Compared to a 20% solution of C12 alkyl  sulfate (AS; sodium lauryl sulfate) alone, decreased erythema was  observed for the combination of 20% C12 AS and 10% cocoamidopropyl  betaine one hour after the removal of patches. The combination of  cocoamidopropyl betaine and C12 AS also reduced swelling of the skin,  and generally interactions between amphoterics and AS produce less  swelling and result in milder skin reactions. Concentrated betaines are  expected to be irritant to skin and eyes. Diluted solutions (3-10%) are  not irritant to skin, but they are mildly irritant to the eyes (4.5%)<br />No  evidence of delayed contact hypersensitivity was found in guinea pigs  after topically administrated solutions of 10% cocoamidopropyl betaine  by using the Magnusson-Kligman maximization test. Various instances of  contact allergy to cocoamidopropyl betaine have been reported. In all of  the reports it was concluded that the observed skin reactions were due  to the presence of 3-dimethylaminopropylamine which is an impurity in  cocoamidopropyl betaine. This impurity is an intermediate in the  synthesis of alkylamidopropyldimethylamines that are intermediates in  the synthesis of the corresponding alkylamido betaines.<br />Cocoamidopropyl  betaine was proven to be non-mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the  Ames Salmonella/microsome reverse mutation assay. Short-term  genotoxicity tests have shown negative results of mutagenicity for  lauryl betaine in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

At the same time\r\nsignificant quantities of amine esters and amide esters are formed by side\r\nreactions.

With tertiary amides (disubstituted amides),\r\nhydrogen bonding is not possible, as exhibited by their increased solubility\r\nand lower melting points. Many fatty acid amides are essentially insoluble in\r\nwater. Amides have a strong tendency to reduce friction on various surfaces by\r\nforming a layer on surfaces. This coating action may be attributed to their\r\nhydrophobic character and strong hydrogen bonding. Fatty acid amides in general\r\nare stable to elevated processing temperatures, air oxidation, and dilute acids\r\nand bases. Alkanolamides are made from triglycerides or fatty acid methyl\r\nesters reacted with monoethanolamine or diethanolamine that then can be\r\nethoxylated with ethylene oxide under basic catalyses. Common products are\r\nstearamide, cocamide, ethylene bis(stearamide), cocamide, DEA or MEA,\r\ncocamidopropyl dimethyl amine, and cocamide monoethanolamine ethoxylate</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Regardless of the carbon number,\r\nthe melting point of most saturated fatty acid amides falls in a range of 100\r\nto 110 C.

Many of the\r\nECOSAR model estimates for the acute toxicity endpoints indicate the chemicals\r\nare \u201cnot toxic at solubility\u201d. However, for surfactants such as the FND Amides\r\nthe acute aquatic toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects\r\nof the surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical\r\ntoxicity.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids.

There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen chloride</p> <p>phosgene</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.\u00a0</p> <p>The numerous studies of aquatic toxicity, many of which were conducted in natural waters with and without added effluents, indicate that the source and composition of the test water dramatically affects the toxicity of the test substance. These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants.\u00a0</p> <p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p>For organic cationics\u00a0</p> <p>Cationic substances, and their polymers and those polymers that are reasonably anticipated to become cationic in the natural aquatic environment (pH range 4-9) may be environmental hazards.</p> <p>Exempt from this concern are those polymers to be used only in solid phase, such as ion-exchange resins, and where the FGEW (Functional Group Equivalent Weight) of cationic groups is not 5000 and above.</p> <p>The numerous studies of aquatic toxicity, many of which were conducted in natural waters with and without added effluents, indicate that the source and composition of the test water dramatically affects the toxicity of the test substance. These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>These chemicals, by the nature of their surfactant properties, are toxic to aquatic organisms at low concentrations. Cationic groups such as alkylsulfoniums, alkylphosphoniums and quaternary ammonium polymers are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. Similarly potentially cationic groups such as amines and isocyanates are of concern. Some cationics, however, may fall into the category of PLCs (polymers of low concern) provided they possess low charge density, and/or are not water-soluble or are not self-dispersing polycarboxylates or poly- (aromatic or aliphatic) sulfonate polymers.</p> <p>The toxicity of quaternary ammonium compounds is known to be greatly reduced in the environment because of preferential binding to dissolved organics in surface water</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Upon this release a biocidal substance can pass a sewage\r\ntreatment plant (STP) and, based on its physical chemical properties, partition\r\nto sewage sludge, which in turn can be used for soil amendments thereby\r\nreleasing the substance into the soil compartment. Alternatively, the substance\r\ncan remain in the water phase in the STP and subsequently end up in the water\r\ncompartment such as surface water etc. Risk assessment for the environment\r\nfocuses on protecting the environmental compartments (air, water and soil) by\r\nperforming hazard assessments on key species, which represent the food chain\r\nwithin the specific compartment. Of special concern is a well functioning STP,\r\nwhich is elemental in many removal processes. The large variety in biocidal\r\napplications leads to complicated exposure scenarios that need to reflect the\r\nintended use and possible degradation pathways, in order to perform an accurate\r\nrisk assessment for the environment.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>CEL TWA: 0.1 mg/m3; STEL 0.3 mg/m3 total isothiazolinones (Rohm and Haas)</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce toxic effects.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Although the material is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may cause transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn). Slight abrasive damage may also result. The material may produce foreign body irritation in certain individuals.</p> <p>Direct contact with alkaline corrosives may produce pain and burns. Oedema, destruction of the epithelium, corneal opacification and iritis may occur. In less severe cases these symptoms tend to resolve. In severe injuries the full extent of the damage may not be immediately apparent with late complications comprising a persistent oedema, vascularisation and corneal scarring, permanent opacity, staphyloma, cataract, symblepharon and loss of sight.</p> <p>Solutions containing isothiazolinones may produce corrosion of the mucous membranes and cornea. Instillation of 0.1 ml of an aqueous solution containing 560 ppm isothiazolinone into rabbit eye did not produce irritation whereas concentrations, typically around 3% and 5.5 %, were severely irritating or corrosive to the eye.. Symptoms included clouding of the cornea, chemosis and swelling of the eyelids.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may produce toxic effects; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>The material is not thought to be a skin irritant (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Abrasive damage however, may result from prolonged exposures. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Skin contact with alkaline corrosives may produce severe pain and burns; brownish stains may develop. The corroded area may be soft, gelatinous and necrotic; tissue destruction may be deep.</p> <p>Aqueous solutions of isothiazolinones may be irritating or even corrosive depending on concentration. Solutions containing more than 0.5% (5000 ppm active substance) may produce severe irritation of human skin whilst solutions containing more than 100 ppm may irritate the skin.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Isothiazolinones are moderately to highly toxic by oral administration. The major signs of toxicity were severe gastric irritation, lethargy, and ataxia\u00a0</p>",

Data are presented which demonstrate that, in comparison with the chlorinated and dichlorinated compounds which share immunological cross-reactivity, the non-chlorinated isothiazolinones have a lower potential for sensitization and no documented immunological cross-reaction with the chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font>The risk of sensitization depends on how contact with the product occurs. The risk is greater when the skin barrier has been damaged and smaller when the skin is healthy.

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

As dyes are designed to be chemically and photolytically stable, they are highly persistent in natural environments. It is thus unlikely that they, in general, will give positive results in short-term tests for aerobic biodegradability. The release of dyes may therefore present an ecotoxic hazard and introduces the potential danger of bioaccumulation that may eventually affect man by transport through the food chain</p> <p>In general the ionic dyes will be almost completely or partly dissociated in an aqueous solution. Solubility in the range 100 mg/l to 80,000 mg/l has been reported for the ionic azo dyes . In addition, they would be expected to have a high to a moderate mobility in soil, sediment and particular matter, indicated by the low Koc values. However, due to their ionic nature, they adsorb as a result of ion-exchange processes. Acid dyes have high fixation rates, being attracted to positively charged substrates (e.g., nitrogen-containing particles, cationic metals) and consequently they can settle out to bed sediments or wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sludge</p> <p>In addition, ionic compounds are not considered to be able to volatilise neither from moist nor dry surfaces, and the vapour pressures for these dyes are very low.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Analysis of over 200 acid dyes indicates that some monoacid and diacid dyes show moderate to high toxicity (that is acute values &lt;100 mg/l and &lt; 1 mg/l) to fish and aquatic organisms. Dyes with three of more acid groups show low toxicity (that is acute values &gt;100 mg/l) towards fish and invertebrates. All acid dyes show moderate toxicity towards green algae. The effects on algae were not the result of direct toxicity but represented an indirect effect due to shading.</p> <p>Algae are generally susceptible to dyes, but the inhibitory effect is thought to be related to light inhibition at high dye concentrations, rather than a direct inhibitory effect of the dyes. This effect may account for up to 50% of the inhibition observed.</p> <p>Virtually all dyes from all chemically distinct groups are prone to fungal oxidation but there are large differences between fungal species with respect to their catalysing power and dye selectivity. A clear relationship between dye structure and fungal dye biodegradability has not been established. Fungal degradation of aromatic structures is a secondary metabolic event that starts when nutrients (C, N and S) become limiting. Therefore, while the enzymes are optimally expressed under starving conditions, supplementation of energy substrates and nutrients are necessary for propagation of the cultures</p> <p>Some chelated dyes, i.e.., Al, Co, Cr, Fe, have shown moderate toxicity towards fish and daphnids and the toxicity has not been explained by the residual free (unchelated) metal ion in the dye product.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Pelargonic acid and its Esters -\u00a0\r\nCosmetic Ingredient Review: CIR Expert Panel Meeting.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.
