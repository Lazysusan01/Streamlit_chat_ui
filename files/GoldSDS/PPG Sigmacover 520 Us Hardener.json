They recommend the limits for the 11 different product categories, which are the acceptable use levels of  benzyl alcohol in the various product categories. These were derived from the application of the exposure based quantitative risk assessment approach for fragrance ingredients.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of benzyl alcohol may affect respiration (paralysis of the respiratory center, respiratory depression, gasping respirations), cardiovascular system (hypotension</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high vapour concentrations may be chest and nasal irritation with coughing, sneezing, headache and even nausea.</p>",

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",

There have been rare reports of deaths, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol. The amount of benzyl alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol. Administration of high dosages of medications containing this preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources.\u00a0</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",

Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>A significant number of individuals exposed to mixed trimethylbenzenes complained of nervousness, tension, anxiety and asthmatic bronchitis. Peripheral blood showed a tendency to hypochromic anaemia and a deviation from normal in coagulability of the blood. Hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from 10 to 60 ppm. Contamination of the mixture with benzene may have been responsible for the blood dyscrasias.</p> <p>High concentrations of mesitylene vapour (5000 to 9000 ppm) caused central nervous system depression in mice. Similar exposures of pseudocumene also produced evidence of CNS involvement.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p>",

Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Petroleum hydrocarbons may produce pain after direct contact with the eyes. Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis. The material is unlikely to produce an irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives .</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>A significant number of individuals exposed to mixed trimethylbenzenes complained of nervousness, tension, anxiety and asthmatic bronchitis. Peripheral blood showed a tendency to hypochromic anaemia and a deviation from normal in coagulability of the blood. Hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from 10 to 60 ppm. Contamination of the mixture with benzene may have been responsible for the blood dyscrasias.</p> <p>High concentrations of mesitylene vapour (5000 to 9000 ppm) caused central nervous system depression in mice. Similar exposures of pseudocumene also produced evidence of CNS involvement.</p>",

Aliphatic and alicyclic amines are generally well absorbed from the respiratory tract. Systemic effects include headache, nausea, faintness and anxiety. These effects are thought to be transient and are probably related to the pharmacodynamic action of the amines.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Vapours of volatile amines cause eye irritation with lachrymation, conjunctivitis and minor transient corneal oedema which results in \"halos\" around lights (glaucopsia, \"blue haze\", or \"blue-grey haze\").

This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouses and enclosed storage areas.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects following inhalation (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, adverse systemic effects have been produced following exposure of animals by at least one other route and good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Inhalation of epoxy resin amine hardener vapours (including polyamines and amine adducts) may produce bronchospasm and coughing episodes lasting days after cessation of the exposure. Even faint traces of these vapours may trigger an intense reaction in individuals showing \"amine asthma\". The literature records several instances of systemic intoxications following the use of amines in epoxy resin systems.</p> <p>Excessive exposure to the vapours of epoxy amine curing agents may cause both respiratory irritation and central nervous system depression.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Cutaneous reactions include erythema, intolerable itching and severe facial swelling. Blistering, with weeping of serious fluid, and crusting and scaling may also occur.</p> <p>Virtually all of the liquid amine curing agents can cause sensitisation or allergic skin reactions.</p> <p>Individuals exhibiting \"amine dermatitis\" may experience a dramatic reaction upon re-exposure to minute quantities. Highly sensitive persons may even react to cured resins containing trace amounts of unreacted amine hardener. Minute quantities of air-borne amine may precipitate intense dermatological symptoms in sensitive individuals. Prolonged or repeated exposure may produce tissue necrosis.</p> <p>NOTE: Susceptibility to this sensitisation will vary from person to person. Also, allergic dermatitis may not appear until after several days or weeks of contact. However, once sensitisation has occurred, exposure of the skin to even very small amounts of the material may cause erythema (redness) and oedema (swelling) at the site. Thus, all skin contact with any epoxy curing agent should be avoided.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p>|Skin contact may result in severe irritation or ulceration/burns and skin sensitisation is known.  Dermatitis may also result from less severe exposures.",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Ingestion of amine epoxy-curing agents (hardeners) may cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. The vomitus may contain blood and mucous. If death does not occur within 24 hours there may be an improvement in the patients condition for 2-4 days only to be followed by the sudden onset of abdominal pain, board-like abdominal rigidity or hypo-tension; this indicates that delayed gastric or oesophageal corrosive damage has occurred.</p>|Ingestion may cause nausea, vomiting of blood and severe gastrointestinal irritation.",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p>",

However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Exposure to doses sufficiently high to produce intoxication and unconsciousness also produces transient liver and kidney toxicity. Neurologic impairment is NOT evident amongst volunteers inhaling up to 400 ppm though complaints of ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation occur at 200 ppm for 3 to 5 minutes.</p> <p>Exposure to xylene at or below the recommended TLV-TWA and STEL is thought to minimise the risk of irritant effects and to produce neither significant narcosis or chronic injury.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination). Although toluene/ethanol interactions are well recognised, the degree of protection afforded by the TLV-TWA among drinkers is not known.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor(OSF)</p> <p>OSF=17 (TOLUENE)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin. Absorption by skin may readily exceed vapour inhalation exposure. Symptoms for skin absorption are the same as for inhalation. Contact with eyes and mucous membranes may also contribute to overall exposure and may also invalidate the exposure standard.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Modified polyamides can offer faster cure speed, lower viscosity and improved chemical resistance<br />Polyalkylenepolyamines are among the most known and widely used classes of epoxy resin curing agent; ethylene polyamines include ethylene diamine (EDA), diethylene triamine (DETA), triethylene tetramine (TETA) tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) and polyethylene polyamines (PEPA) with the general formula:<br />H2N-CH2-CH2-NH(CH2-CH20NH)nH where n=1-10<br />These compounds are glycerol-like viscous liquid that are compatible with epoxy oligomers.<br />The advantages of these curing agents are their efficiency in cold curing of epoxy oligomers and the capacity of yielding polymer materials with a complex of fairly high strength characteristics, dielectric and adhesive, and waterproof properties. Common disadvantages of these curing agents are the high volatility and toxicity which makes these compounds hazardous in actual practice. The process of curing epoxy resins with ethylene polyamines often occurs too quickly and irregularly, and is accompanied by a great exothermic effect; in the case of large indiscrete masses, this can lead to localised overheating and thus, to degradation of the strength characteristics of the polymers. In addition these amines dilute epoxy oligomers poorly, as a result of which, their use is limited to potting and impregnating compounds and other epoxy compositions that are processed in the state of viscous flow.<br />The polyethylenepolyamine adducts with nitriles, alkylene oxides, aldehydes and ketones, as well as mono-, and diepoxides, have been widely used to overcome some of the disadvantages.<br />The combination of high functionality with different nature, basicity and activity of amino groups in these curing agents must in turn provide the polyreactivity of curing systems and the complex of useful performance properties of epoxy resins<br />Key Words<br />ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA) tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) and polyethylenepolyamines (PEPA)</p> <p>The material is produced by the reaction of aqueous ammonia with 1,2-dichloroethane. This process yields the entire family of ethyleneamines: ethylenediamine, piperazine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine and aminoethylpiperazine. These polyamines are produced as their hydrochloride salts, and must be neutralised, typically with aqueous caustic soda, to obtain the free amines. The by-product salt produced in the neutralisation step is separated and the individual products are isolated by fractional distillation. The commercial product contains trace amounts of the other ethyleneamines.</p> <p>The ethyleneamines may be used in a number of production processes:</p> <ul> <li>The reaction with polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride yields the corresponding polybutenylsuccinimides, which are ashless, dispersant- detergent additives for motor oil.\u00a0</li> <li>Polyamide -epichlorohydrin resins are produced by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with a polyamide, such as those formed by polymerisation of adipic acid and TETA.

Soils with increased CEC and organic content exhibited higher affinities for these amines. This dependence of adsorption on CEC and organic content is most likely due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amine and the negatively charged soil surface.</p> <p>For alkyl polyamines:</p> <p>All members of this cluster are miscible or soluble in water. The estimated value of log Kows-range from 3.67 to 1.8 is consistent with the available experimental water solubilities. Vapour pressures range from 1.1x 10-6 hPa to 0.31 hPa. Estimated and experimental pKbs are in a relatively narrow range of 9.68 to 10.7.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Members of this cluster are expected to have varying degrees of mobility in the soil. Low vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constants suggest that these compounds are not expected to be in the vapor phase. Modeling suggests that all members of this cluster are likely to react rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radials with half-lives on the order of an hour, but with little material in the vapor phase, it is not expected to be a predominant removal pathway for these chemicals. Experimental data and results from estimation models indicate that all members of this cluster have the potential to biodegrade aerobically under environmental conditions. Fugacity models indicate that the members of this cluster are likely to partition predominately to soil and water. All chemicals in this cluster are expected to have low environmental persistence. Measured and estimated bioconcentration factors for members of this cluster indicate a low potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Evaluation of the available experimental and estimated aquatic toxicity data indicate acute toxicity to fish \u00a0is low. Daphnia aquatic toxicity is generally low. Algae appear to be the most sensitive organism with several members of the cluster having measured or estimated toxicity values indicative of moderate toxicity. Chronic toxicity for all cluster members is estimated; it is generally low for fish and algae, but high for daphnia.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for triethylenetetramine (TETA):</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">TETA is completely miscible with water forming an alkaline\r\nsolution (pH 10 at 10 g/l). The technical product has a vapour pressure of ca.\r\n1 Pa at 20 C. The calculated Log Pow (unprotonated form) amounts to ca. -1.4\r\nand indicates a low potential for bioaccumulation. There are no measured Koc\r\n-values available. For ethylenediamine (CAS Nr. 107- 15-3) and\r\ndiethylenetriamine (CAS Nr. 111-40- 0), Koc -values of 4766 and 19111 were\r\nmeasured respectively. The high adsorption is most likely due to electrostatic\r\ninteraction. A comparable Koc can be expected for TETA, which would suggest a\r\nhigh potential for geoaccumulation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">TETA is not readily biodegradable (0% after 20 days, OECD GL 301\r\nD; same result with adapted inoculum).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Amine adducts have much reduced volatility and are less irritating to the skin and eyes than amine hardeners.

The formation of nitrosamines from such amines has not only been observed in animals models but, at least for certain compounds, in the workplace. The amine-containing substances and end products handled at work can themselves be contaminated to a degree with corresponding nitrosamines. Under conditions encountered in practice nitrosation is to be expected with secondary amines and to a limited extent with primary and tertiary amines. Nitrogen oxides are the most probable nitrosating agents. Nitrosyl chloride, nitrite esters, metal nitrites and nitroso compounds may also be involved. Several factors such as pH, temperature, catalysts and inhibitors influence the extent of nitrosation.

In addition chronic stress factors, which lead to high stimulation of epithelial turnover, are a pacemaker for malignant progression.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available.

Component of polyamide resins, hardeners or curing agents for epoxy systems.|[~Intermediate ~]|#28hardamin <p>Polyamide adducts provide good compatibility (without induction period) and better cure under adverse conditions than standard polyamides. Modified polyamides can offer faster cure speed, lower viscosity and improved chemical resistance<br />Polyalkylenepolyamines are among the most known and widely used classes of epoxy resin curing agent; ethylene polyamines include ethylene diamine (EDA), diethylene triamine (DETA), triethylene tetramine (TETA) tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) and polyethylene polyamines (PEPA) with the general formula:<br />H2N-CH2-CH2-NH(CH2-CH20NH)nH where n=1-10<br />These compounds are glycerol-like viscous liquid that are compatible with epoxy oligomers.<br />The advantages of these curing agents are their efficiency in cold curing of epoxy oligomers and the capacity of yielding polymer materials with a complex of fairly high strength characteristics, dielectric and adhesive, and waterproof properties. Common disadvantages of these curing agents are the high volatility and toxicity which makes these compounds hazardous in actual practice. The process of curing epoxy resins with ethylene polyamines often occurs too quickly and irregularly, and is accompanied by a great exothermic effect; in the case of large indiscrete masses, this can lead to localised overheating and thus, to degradation of the strength characteristics of the polymers. In addition these amines dilute epoxy oligomers poorly, as a result of which, their use is limited to potting and impregnating compounds and other epoxy compositions that are processed in the state of viscous flow.<br />The polyethylenepolyamine adducts with nitriles, alkylene oxides, aldehydes and ketones, as well as mono-, and diepoxides, have been widely used to overcome some of the disadvantages.<br />The combination of high functionality with different nature, basicity and activity of amino groups in these curing agents must in turn provide the polyreactivity of curing systems and the complex of useful performance properties of epoxy resins<br />Key Words<br />ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA) tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) and polyethylenepolyamines (PEPA)</p> <p>The material is produced by the reaction of aqueous ammonia with 1,2-dichloroethane. This process yields the entire family of ethyleneamines: ethylenediamine, piperazine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine and aminoethylpiperazine. These polyamines are produced as their hydrochloride salts, and must be neutralised, typically with aqueous caustic soda, to obtain the free amines. The by-product salt produced in the neutralisation step is separated and the individual products are isolated by fractional distillation. The commercial product contains trace amounts of the other ethyleneamines.</p> <p>The ethyleneamines may be used in a number of production processes:</p> <ul> <li>The reaction with polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride yields the corresponding polybutenylsuccinimides, which are ashless, dispersant- detergent additives for motor oil.\u00a0</li> <li>Polyamide -epichlorohydrin resins are produced by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with a polyamide, such as those formed by polymerisation of adipic acid and TETA.

Due to the severely irritating or corrosive nature of the material, swallowing may lead to ulceration and inflammation of the upper alimentary tract with haemorrhage and fluid loss. Perforation of the oesophagus or stomach may occur, leading to mediastinitis or peritonitis and resulting complications.. The stomach should be evacuated carefully in case of ingestion. Due to the irritating nature of the material, any aspiration during vomiting could result in severe lung injury. Therefor emesis should not be induced mechanically or pharmacologically.. However, the acute peroral systemic toxicity of the material indicates that evacuation of the stomach contents should be undertaken at the earliest possible time by means carrying the least likelihood of aspiration (e.g. the use of gastric lavage with endotracheal intubation).|Exposure to the vapour may cause minor transient oedema of the corneal epithelium. This condition, referred to as glaucopsia, \"blue-haze\", or \"blue-grey haze\" produces a blurring of the vision against a general bluish haze and the appearance of halos around bright objects. The effect disappears spontaneously within a few hours of the end of exposure, and leaves no sequelae. Although not detrimental to the eye, per se, glaucopsia predisposes an affected individual to physical accidents and reduces the ability to undertake skilled tasks such as driving vehicles.|53aminepu<p>Treat symptomatically.</p> <p>For acute or short-term repeated exposures to highly alkaline materials:</p> <ul> <li>Respiratory stress is uncommon but present occasionally because of soft tissue edema.\u00a0</li> <li>Unless endotracheal intubation can be accomplished under direct vision, cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy may be necessary.\u00a0</li> <li>Oxygen is given as indicated.\u00a0</li> <li>The presence of shock suggests perforation and mandates an intravenous line and fluid administration.\u00a0</li> <li>Damage due to alkaline corrosives occurs by liquefaction necrosis whereby the saponification of fats and solubilisation of proteins allow deep penetration into the tissue.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Alkalis continue to cause damage after exposure.</p> <p>\u00a0INGESTION:</p> <ul> <li>Milk and water are the preferred diluents\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>No more than 2 glasses of water should be given to an adult.</p> <ul> <li>Neutralising agents should never be given since exothermic heat reaction may compound injury.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>* Catharsis and emesis are absolutely contra-indicated.</p> <p>* Activated charcoal does not absorb alkali.</p> <p>* Gastric lavage should not be used.</p> <p>\u00a0Supportive care involves the following:</p> <ul> <li>Withhold oral feedings initially.\u00a0</li> <li>If endoscopy confirms transmucosal injury start steroids only within the first 48 hours.\u00a0</li> <li>Carefully evaluate the amount of tissue necrosis before assessing the need for surgical intervention.\u00a0</li> <li>Patients should be instructed to seek medical attention whenever they develop difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia).\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0SKIN AND EYE:</p> <ul> <li>Injury should be irrigated for 20-30 minutes.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Eye injuries require saline. \u00a0 [Ellenhorn &amp; Barceloux: Medical Toxicology]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>If exposure has been severe and/or symptoms marked, observation in hospital for 48 hours should be considered due to possibility of delayed pulmonary oedema.</p>",

Soils with increased CEC and organic content exhibited higher affinities for these amines. This dependence of adsorption on CEC and organic content is most likely due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amine and the negatively charged soil surface.</p> <p>For alkyl polyamines:</p> <p>All members of this cluster are miscible or soluble in water. The estimated value of log Kows-range from 3.67 to 1.8 is consistent with the available experimental water solubilities. Vapour pressures range from 1.1x 10-6 hPa to 0.31 hPa. Estimated and experimental pKbs are in a relatively narrow range of 9.68 to 10.7.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Members of this cluster are expected to have varying degrees of mobility in the soil. Low vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constants suggest that these compounds are not expected to be in the vapor phase. Modeling suggests that all members of this cluster are likely to react rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radials with half-lives on the order of an hour, but with little material in the vapor phase, it is not expected to be a predominant removal pathway for these chemicals. Experimental data and results from estimation models indicate that all members of this cluster have the potential to biodegrade aerobically under environmental conditions. Fugacity models indicate that the members of this cluster are likely to partition predominately to soil and water. All chemicals in this cluster are expected to have low environmental persistence. Measured and estimated bioconcentration factors for members of this cluster indicate a low potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Evaluation of the available experimental and estimated aquatic toxicity data indicate acute toxicity to fish \u00a0is low. Daphnia aquatic toxicity is generally low. Algae appear to be the most sensitive organism with several members of the cluster having measured or estimated toxicity values indicative of moderate toxicity. Chronic toxicity for all cluster members is estimated; it is generally low for fish and algae, but high for daphnia.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for diethylenetriamine (DETA)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">DETA is miscible with water and inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">log Kow \u00a0: -2.27</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The material will leach into ground water and is not expected to\r\nbe biodegradable.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Amine adducts have much reduced volatility and are less irritating to the skin and eyes than amine hardeners.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of amine vapours may cause irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat and lung irritation with respiratory distress and cough. Single exposures to near lethal concentrations and repeated exposures to sublethal concentrations produces tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema. Aliphatic and alicyclic amines are generally well absorbed from the respiratory tract. Systemic effects include headache, nausea, faintness and anxiety. These effects are thought to be transient and are probably related to the pharmacodynamic action of the amines. Histamine release by aliphatic amines may produce bronchoconstriction and wheezing.</p> <p>Inhalation of epoxy resin amine hardener vapours (including polyamines and amine adducts) may produce bronchospasm and coughing episodes lasting days after cessation of the exposure. Even faint traces of these vapours may trigger an intense reaction in individuals showing \"amine asthma\". The literature records several instances of systemic intoxications following the use of amines in epoxy resin systems.</p> <p>Excessive exposure to the vapours of epoxy amine curing agents may cause both respiratory irritation and central nervous system depression. Signs and symptoms of central nervous system depression, in order of increasing exposure, are</p> <p>headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and incoordination. In short, a single prolonged (measured in hours) or excessive inhalation exposure may cause serious adverse effects, including death.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct contact with alkaline corrosives may produce pain and burns. Oedema, destruction of the epithelium, corneal opacification and iritis may occur. In less severe cases these symptoms tend to resolve. In severe injuries the full extent of the damage may not be immediately apparent with late complications comprising a persistent oedema, vascularisation and corneal scarring, permanent opacity, staphyloma, cataract, symblepharon and loss of sight.</p> <p>Vapours of volatile amines cause eye irritation with lachrymation, conjunctivitis and minor transient corneal oedema which results in \"halos\" around lights (glaucopsia, \"blue haze\", or \"blue-grey haze\"). Vision may become misty and halos may appear several hours after workers are exposed to the substance</p> <p>This effect generally disappears spontaneously within a few hours of the end of exposure, and does not produce physiological after-effects. However oedema of the corneal epithelium, which is primarily responsible for vision disturbances, may take more than one or more days to clear, depending on the severity of exposure. Photophobia and discomfort from the roughness of the corneal surface also may occur after greater exposures.</p> <p>Although no detriment to the eye occurs as such, glaucopsia predisposes an affected individual to physical accidents and reduces the ability to undertake skilled tasks such as driving a vehicle.</p> <p>Direct local contact with the liquid may produce eye damage which may be permanent in the case of the lower molecular weight species.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact with the material may produce severely toxic effects; systemic effects may result following absorption and these may be fatal.</p> <p>Volatile amine vapours produce primary skin irritation and dermatitis. Direct local contact, with the lower molecular weight liquids, may produce skin burns. Percutaneous absorption of simple aliphatic amines is known to produce lethal effects often the same as that for oral administration. Cutaneous sensitisation has been recorded chiefly due to ethyleneamines. Histamine release following exposure to many aliphatic amines may result in \"triple response\" (white vasoconstriction, red flare and wheal) in human skin.</p> <p>Amine epoxy-curing agents (hardeners) may produce primary skin irritation and sensitisation dermatitis in predisposed individuals. Cutaneous reactions include erythema, intolerable itching and severe facial swelling. Blistering, with weeping of serious fluid, and crusting and scaling may also occur.</p> <p>Virtually all of the liquid amine curing agents can cause sensitisation or allergic skin reactions.</p> <p>Individuals exhibiting \"amine dermatitis\" may experience a dramatic reaction upon re-exposure to minute quantities. Highly sensitive persons may even react to cured resins containing trace amounts of unreacted amine hardener. Minute quantities of air-borne amine may precipitate intense dermatological symptoms in sensitive individuals. Prolonged or repeated exposure may produce tissue necrosis.</p> <p>NOTE: Susceptibility to this sensitisation will vary from person to person. Also, allergic dermatitis may not appear until after several days or weeks of contact. However, once sensitisation has occurred, exposure of the skin to even very small amounts of the material may cause erythema (redness) and oedema (swelling) at the site. Thus, all skin contact with any epoxy curing agent should be avoided.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact with alkaline corrosives may produce severe pain and burns; brownish stains may develop. The corroded area may be soft, gelatinous and necrotic; tissue destruction may be deep.</p> <p>Reactions may not occur on exposure but response may be delayed with symptoms only appearing many hours later</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Ingestion of amine epoxy-curing agents (hardeners) may cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. The vomitus may contain blood and mucous. If death does not occur within 24 hours there may be an improvement in the patients condition for 2-4 days only to be followed by the sudden onset of abdominal pain, board-like abdominal rigidity or hypo-tension; this indicates that delayed gastric or oesophageal corrosive damage has occurred.</p> <p>Aliphatic and alicyclic amines are generally well absorbed from the gut. Corrosive action may cause tissue damage throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Detoxification is thought to occur in the liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa with the enzymes, monoamine oxidase and diamine oxidase (histaminase) having a significant role.</p>",

The formation of nitrosamines from such amines has not only been observed in animals models but, at least for certain compounds, in the workplace. The amine-containing substances and end products handled at work can themselves be contaminated to a degree with corresponding nitrosamines. Under conditions encountered in practice nitrosation is to be expected with secondary amines and to a limited extent with primary and tertiary amines. Nitrogen oxides are the most probable nitrosating agents. Nitrosyl chloride, nitrite esters, metal nitrites and nitroso compounds may also be involved. Several factors such as pH, temperature, catalysts and inhibitors influence the extent of nitrosation. Two precautionary measures are therefore necessary when handling amines at the workplace.</p> <ul> <li>Simultaneous exposure to nitrosating agents should be reduced to minimum. This can be out into practice by eliminating nitrosating agents or, if they play a role in the actual process, replacing them with substances that do not lead to the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. In particular the level of nitrogen oxides at the workplace should be monitored and reduced when necessary.\u00a0</li> <li>The levels of nitrosamines in the workplace and in substances containing amines should be monitored.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area, Report No. 31, DFG, 1995</p> <p>In animal experiments the oesophagus is shown to be the most important target organ for nitrosamines, independent of the route of application. The mechanism of this organotrophy cannot be explained sufficiently. The high oesophageal epithelium metabolic activation of nitrosamines, together with a comparatively low DNA repair, probably plays the most important role. In addition chronic stress factors, which lead to high stimulation of epithelial turnover, are a pacemaker for malignant progression. In some countries, the traditional consumption of extremely hot drinks leads to constant burns of the oesophagus, which increases the risk. Mate, a non-alcoholic brew, frequently consumed as tea in Uruguay, appears to be a high risk factor for oesophageal cancer</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Inhalation of epoxy resin amine hardener vapours (including polyamines and amine adducts) may produce bronchospasm and coughing episodes lasting days after cessation of the exposure. Even faint traces of these vapours may trigger an intense reaction in individuals showing \"amine asthma\". The literature records several instances of systemic intoxications following the use of amines in epoxy resin systems.</p> <p>Excessive exposure to the vapours of epoxy amine curing agents may cause both respiratory irritation and central nervous system depression. Signs and symptoms of central nervous system depression, in order of increasing exposure, are</p> <p>headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and incoordination.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
