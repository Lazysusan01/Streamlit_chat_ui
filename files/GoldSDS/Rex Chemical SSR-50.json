The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of the glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decrease significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats. This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure. Ethylene glycol ethers and acetates are mainly metabolised to alkoxyacetic acids but there is also a minor pathway through ethylene glycol to oxalic acid. The main pathway of ethylene glycol ethers is associated with significant clinical or experimental health effects, but the minor pathway is also interesting because formation of urinary stones depends principally upon urinary concentration of oxalate and calcium. In one study (1) the tendency to form urinary stones was 2.4 times higher amongst silk-screen printers exposed to ethylene glycol ethers, than among office workers.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "Environment": "<p>Soluble silicates are wholly inorganic and once diluted have no significant environmental impact. They are saturated with respect to oxygen and as such do not possess a chemical oxygen demand (COD) or a biological oxygen demand (BOD). Depending on pH values soluble silicates in effluent and surface waters are rapidly dispersed and neutralised, by reaction with naturally occurring dissolved polyvalent metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, Al, Fe) forming insoluble silicates or amorphous silica. These products occur in abundance in natural soils and rocks. Dissolved silica resulting from commercial soluble silicates is also indistinguishable from naturally dissolved silica. The soluble silica input to the natural silica cycle from commercial use is furthermore inconsequential in view of the relative size and flux of the natural system. Concentrations of silica in natural waters commonly range from 1 to around 30 mg/l. Higher concentrations (up to 360 mg/l), however, have been found in some groundwaters where these high levels are related to rock type and water temperatures.</p> <p>\u00a0A study of the fate and possible effects of soluble silicates (waterglass) emissions to surface water has been performed by TNO (Apeldoorn NL, 2002). From the results of this study, no significant adverse effects to aquatic systems are to be assumed.</p> <p>Depending on pH values, reaction with naturally occurring dissolved polyvalent metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe, Al) will result in insoluble silicate or amorphous silica being formed. These products occur in abundance in natural soils and rocks. Dissolved silica resulting from commercial soluble silicates is also indistinguishable from naturally dissolved silica.</p> <p>Soluble silicates are totally insoluble in n-octanol (and most other organic solvents). The oil/water partition coefficient of these substances is therefore not applicable. Soluble silicates have no potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p>Untreated soluble silicate solutions are generally alkaline (pH values &gt; 9) and therefore neutralisation should be carried out before discharging to water/ effluent systems. Once neutralised, no adverse effects on aquatic biosystems are known.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>No specific exposure limits have been established for soluble silicates.</p> <p>For liquids the creation of aerosols should be avoided. For powders, general dust exposure limits according to regulation will apply (typically 1- 10 mg/m3). For corrosive soluble silicates (Molar Ratio SiO2:M2O &lt;/=1.6), the exposure limits set for sodium hydroxide should be considered as a guideline (2 mg/m3).</p> #CEL TWA: 2 mg/m3                                           [Manufacturer]",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts.

Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p>"
