Therefore the concentration of chlorine in an aqueous solution is generally expressed as free available chlorine (FAC) which is the sum of Cl2 + HOCl + ClO-, regardless whether these species stem from dissolved gaseous chlorine or from dissolved sodium/calcium hypochlorite</p> <p>Hypochlorite anion dissolved in water is brought to equilibrium between active chlorine species like chlorine (Cl2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or hypochlorite ClO-. The relative amounts of the components are dependent on ionic strength and pH. At the pH in the natural environment (6-8), HOCl or ClO is dominating (HClO: pKa = 7.53). A diluted aqueous solution of HOCl will decompose very slowly in the dark, but more rapidly in the presence of light, particularly rapidly in full sun light, by producing hydrogen chloride and oxygen. Some chlorine and chloric acid (HClO3) may also develop. The physico-chemical properties indicate that chlorine released into the environment as HClO or Cl2 is distributed into water and air. Consequently, the effects that may manifest in the natural environment are considered common to those assessed for the other source of hypochlorite.</p> <p>In the natural water, in the presence of organic or inorganic compounds, the free available chlorine immediately reacts forming various chlorinated and/or oxidized by-products e.g. chloramines or chloromethanes. They are mainly distributed to the hydrosphere, but are also able to transfer to some extent to the atmosphere depending on their intrinsic properties. A potential for bioaccumulation or bioconcentration of active chlorine species can be disregarded, because of their water solubility and their high reactivity.</p> <p>In fresh water, the hypochlorites break down rapidly into non-toxic compounds when exposed to sunlight. In seawater, chlorine levels decline rapidly; however, hypobromite (which is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms) is formed. Sodium and calcium hypochlorite are low in toxicity to avian wildlife, but they are highly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates.</p> <p>Hypochlorite is a highly reactive chemical which, during and after its use in household scenarios, undergoes a variety of reactions. The major one is the oxidation of inorganic and organic species.</p> <p>A minor reaction, which consumes about 1.5% of the chlorine atoms from hypochlorite, is chlorination, which leads to formation of organohalogen by-products that are often measured by the group parameter, AOX.</p> <p>Hypochlorite itself is rapidly broken down during use, in the sewer, and if any does reach sewage treatment it will further degrade (half-life of around 0.6 minutes). Predictions have indicated that its concentration will fall to below 1.E-32 ug/l by the end of the sewer, partially due to its reaction with ammonia in the sewer which leads to a subsequent increase in chloramine.</p> <p>The organohalogen by-products formed from the use of hypochlorite are currently receiving much attention. However, the levels of AOX produced are low (for example, 37 ug/l from bleach use compared to a sewage background level of 106 ug/l), and the organohalogens produced from domestic use of hypochlorite are not believed to have an adverse effect on the environment. Available data indicate that no dioxins are produced, and that the identified AOXs are typically small molecules with a low degree of chlorination and for which ecotoxicological properties are known or can be predicted. Where drinking water is disinfected by chlorination, the levels of organohalogens in sewage effluent arising from bleach use will be comparable with, and sometimes only a fraction of, those arising from the tap-water. After secondary sewage treatment, the levels entering receiving waters will be of the same order of magnitude as background levels typically present in rivers, though the total flux in rivers from natural sources will be much greater.</p> <p>The majority of the measured AOX is unidentified, but thought to consist of high molecular weight components formed from fats, proteins and humic acids which are too large to bioaccumulate.</p> <p>In addition, studies on the whole AOX mixture in laundry waste-water indicated that the level of AOX present did not effect growth or reproduction of\u00a0<i>Ceriodaphnia</i>, and that around 70% is removed in activated sludge.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The level of chloramine reaching surface water is estimated to be below 5.E-10 ug/l. Both these concentrations are orders of magnitude below the lowest acute EC50s determined for sodium hypochlorite (EC50 to invertebrates = 5 ug/l) and monochloramine (EC50 to invertebrates = 16 ug/l).</p> <p>Valid freshwater short-term toxicity data are available only for invertebrates: the LC50 for Ceriodaphnia dubia is 5 ug FAC/l (FAC=Free available chlorine). Adequate standard acute tests in fish are not available, but from many reliable studies performed under intermittent exposure conditions a 96h LC50 of 60 ug TRC/L and a 168 h LC50 of 330 ug TRC/L can be derived (TRC = total residual chlorine = the sum of combined and free residual available chlorine). Due to the intermittent regime (three 45 minutes pulses per day) a 96h LC50 &lt;&lt; 60 ug TRC/l can be expected for fish in a standard test. Most lowest result for algae is reported for Thalassiosira pseudonana with a IC50 of 75 ug/L (20 deg C).</p> <p>Regarding long-term toxicity to freshwater organisms, the lowest NOEC was 5 ug/L (Ictalurus punctatus, 133 d, growth). In microcosm and field studies the most sensitive parameter was the density of zooplankton with a NOEC of 1.5 ug TRC/L, and zooplankton is more sensitive to chlorine than algae.</p> <p>For salt water, valid short-term toxicity data are available for mollusks and for fish (Oncorhynchus kisutch 96 h LC50 = 32 ug TRO/L) (TRO = Total Residual Oxidant) showing comparable sensitivity. For long term toxicity the molluscs are more sensitive than fish showing a 15 d NOEC of 6.2 ug TRO/L. It is impossible to delineate representative toxicity indicator figures because of the unique feature of the chemical to be tested in standard methods. However, the accumulated scientific information covering a wide range of species, temperature,application regime or field studies can be used for the hazard assessment.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Skin contact will result in rapid drying, bleaching, leading to chemical burns on prolonged contact</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Contact may cause severe itchiness, skin lesions and mild eczema.</p> <p>A 5.25% solution of sodium hypochlorite applied to intact human skin for 4 hours and observed at 4, 24 and 48 hours resulted in exudation an slight sloughing of the skin on 4 of 7 subjects.</p> <p>Two patients were reported with chronic allergic dermatitis of the hand related to sensitisation to sodium hypochlorite as the active component of laundry bleach</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material can produce severe chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of hypochlorites may cause burning in the mouth and throat, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain and inflammation of the mouth and stomach, fall of blood pressure, shock, confusion, \u00a0and delirium. Severe poisonings may lead to convulsion, coma and death. Ingestion irritates the mouth, throat, and stomach. The hypochlorous acid liberated in the stomach can cause wall perforation, toxemia, haemorrhage and death.</p> <p>Necrosis and haemorrhage of the upper digestive tract, oedema and pulmonary emphysema were found on autopsy after suicidal ingestion, and methaemoglobinaemia was also reported in another fatal case</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Reduced respiratory capacity may result from chronic low level exposure to chlorine gas. Chronic poisoning may result in coughing, severe chest pains, sore throat and haemoptysis (bloody sputum). Moderate to severe exposures over 3 years produced decreased lung capacity in a number of workers.</p> <p>Delayed effects can include shortness of breath, violent headaches, pulmonary oedema and pneumonia.\u00a0</p> <p>Amongst chloralkali workers exposed to mean concentrations of 0.15 ppm for an average of 10.9 years a generalised pattern of fatigue (exposures of 0.5 ppm and above) and a modest increased incidence of anxiety and dizziness were recorded. Leukocytosis and a lower haematocrit showed some relation to exposure.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Severe acute sodium hydroxide dust inhalation exposure may be fatal due to spasm, inflammation and oedema of the larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and severe pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Symptoms of overexposure include burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea and vomiting.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

Oedema, destruction of the epithelium, corneal opacification and iritis may occur. In less severe cases these symptoms tend to resolve.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of sodium hydroxide may result in severe burns to the mouth, throat and stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the larynx and subsequent suffocation, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p> <p>A 1% aqueous solution (pH 13.4)of sodium hydroxide \u00a0failed to cause gastric, oesophageal or other damage in rabbits.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p> <p>Reduced respiratory capacity may result from chronic low level exposure to chlorine gas. Chronic poisoning may result in coughing, severe chest pains, sore throat and haemoptysis (bloody sputum). Moderate to severe exposures over 3 years produced decreased lung capacity in a number of workers.</p> <p>Delayed effects can include shortness of breath, violent headaches, pulmonary oedema and pneumonia.\u00a0</p> <p>Amongst chloralkali workers exposed to mean concentrations of 0.15 ppm for an average of 10.9 years a generalised pattern of fatigue (exposures of 0.5 ppm and above) and a modest increased incidence of anxiety and dizziness were recorded. Leukocytosis and a lower haematocrit showed some relation to exposure.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p>",
