Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour. A STEL is recommended to prevent mucous membrane and ocular irritation and prevention of acute depression of the central nervous system. Because of the wide variation in molecular weights of its components, the conversion of ppm to mg/m3 is approximate. Sweden recommends hexane type limits of 100 ppm and heptane and octane type limits of 300 ppm. Germany does not assign a value because of the widely differing compositions and resultant differences in toxic properties.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor (OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.042 (gasoline)</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p>",

Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis. The material is unlikely to produce an irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives .</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "FirstAidAdviceToDoctor": "<p><br /></p> <p>for naphthalene intoxication: Naphthalene requires hepatic and microsomal activation prior to the production of toxic effects. Liver microsomes catalyse the initial synthesis of the reactive 1,2-epoxide intermediate which is subsequently oxidised to naphthalene dihydrodiol and alpha-naphthol. The 2-naphthoquinones are thought to produce haemolysis, the 1,2-naphthoquinones are thought to be responsible for producing cataracts in rabbits, and the glutathione-adducts of naphthalene-1,2-oxide are probably responsible for pulmonary toxicity. Suggested treatment regime:</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0Induce emesis and/or perform gastric lavage with large amounts of warm water where oral poisoning is suspected.\u00a0</li> <li>Instill a saline cathartic such as magnesium or sodium sulfate in water (15 to 30g).\u00a0</li> <li>Demulcents such as milk, egg white, gelatin, or other protein solutions may be useful after the stomach is emptied but oils should be avoided because they promote absorption.\u00a0</li> <li>If eyes/skin contaminated, flush with warm water followed by the application of a bland ointment.\u00a0</li> <li>Severe anaemia, due to haemolysis, may require small repeated blood transfusions, preferably with red cells from a non-sensitive individual.\u00a0</li> <li>Where intravascular haemolysis, with haemoglobinuria occurs, protect the kidneys by promoting a brisk flow of dilute urine with, for example, an osmotic diuretic such as mannitol.

Since most airborne\r\nnaphthalene is in the vapor phase, deposition is expected to be very slow\r\n(about 0.04\u20130.06 cm/sec). It has been estimated that about 2\u20133% of naphthalene\r\nemitted to air is transported to other environmental media, mostly by dry deposition\r\n.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Naphthalene in surface water may volatilise to the atmosphere. The\r\nrate of volatilization also depends upon several environmental conditions,\r\nincluding temperature, wind velocity, and mixing rates of the air and water\r\ncolumns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Log octanol/water partition coefficients (Kow) for naphthalene\r\nrange from 3.29 to 3.37 and log organic carbon coefficients (Koc) range from\r\n2.97 to 3.27. The reported experimentally determined log Koc is 3.11.\r\n\u00a0Based on the magnitude of these values, it is expected that only a small\r\nfraction (&lt;10%) of naphthalene in typical surface water would be associated\r\nwith particulate matter. Thus, naphthalene discharged to surface waters would\r\nremain largely in solution, with smaller quantities being associated with\r\nsuspended solids and benthic sediments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Naphthalene is easily volatilized from aerated soils and is\r\nadsorbed to a moderate extent (10%) . The extent of sorption depends on the\r\norganic carbon content of the soil, with rapid movement expected through sandy\r\nsoils. The estimated soil adsorption coefficient for naphthalene in a soil with\r\n&lt;0.6% organic carbon is 1.8 . Because it adsorbs to aquifer material,\r\nnaphthalene's passage through groundwater will be somewhat retarded. However,\r\nsorption of naphthalene to aquifer materials with low organic carbon content\r\n(&lt;0.03%) may be enhanced by the presence of nonionic low-polarity organics,\r\nsuch as tetrachloroethene, commonly found at hazardous waste sites.\r\n\u00a0Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for naphthalene have been measured and calculated\r\nfrom the Kow, Koc, or water solubility. The values reported for log BCF range\r\nfrom 1.6 to 3, indicating moderate bioconcentration in aquatic organisms.\r\nNaphthalene is reported to be rapidly eliminated from invertebrates when the\r\norganisms are placed in pollutant-free water, and naphthalene is readily\r\nmetabolized in fish . Based on the magnitude of the Kow, bioaccumulation in the\r\nfood chain is not expected to occur. However, naphthalene exposure of cows and\r\nchickens could lead to the presence of naphthalene in milk and eggs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Limited data were located on transport and partitioning of\r\nmethylnaphthalenes in the environment. The respective vapor pressures (0.054\r\nand 0.068 mmHg), water solubilities (25.8 and 24.6 mg/L), and Henry's law\r\nconstants (3.60x10-4 and 4.99x10-4 atm-m3/mol) for 1-methylnaphthalene and\r\n2-methylnaphthalene are of similar magnitude to these properties for\r\nnaphthalene. Thus, it is likely that loss of methylnaphthalenes from ambient\r\nwater occurs by volatilization. \u00a0Based on the magnitude of log Kow for\r\n1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene (3.87 and 3.86, respectively)\r\n\u00a0and the experimental log Koc for 2-methylnaphthalene (3.93) , these\r\nchemicals may partition similarly to naphthalene in environmental media and are\r\nexpected to be slightly mobile to immobile in soils. Log BCFs calculated for\r\n2-methylnaphthalene range from 2 to 2.8 and measured log BCFs for\r\n1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene in oysters ranged from 2.7 to 4.1.\r\nMethylnaphthalenes are also metabolised and excreted rapidly by fish and\r\nshellfish when they are removed from polluted waters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The most important atmospheric removal process for naphthalene is\r\nreaction with photochemically</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">produced hydroxyl radicals. The major products of this reaction\r\nare 1- and 2-naphthol and 1- and 2-nitronaphthalene. Naphthalene also reacts\r\nwith N2O5, nitrate radicals, and ozone in the atmosphere and photolysis is\r\nexpected to occur. \u00a0Methylnaphthalenes also react with hydroxyl radicals.\r\nThe reported rate constants are 5.30x10-11 and 5.23x10-11 cm3/molecule-sec for\r\n1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively. Based on an\r\natmospheric hydroxyl radical concentration of 1x10 6/cm3, the corresponding\r\natmospheric half-lives are 3.6 and 3.7 hours. \u00a0Reactions of\r\n1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene with N2O5 radicals have half-lives\r\nof 24 and 19 days, respectively. \u00a0These chemicals also react with\r\natmospheric ozone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes are degraded in water by\r\nphotolysis and biological processes. The half-life for photolysis of\r\nnaphthalene in surface water is estimated to be about 71 hours, but the\r\nhalf-life in deeper water (5 m) is estimated at 550 days. The half-lives for\r\nphotolysis of 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene were estimated at 22\r\nand 54 hours, respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation of naphthalene is sufficiently rapid for it to be a\r\ndominant fate process in aquatic systems. Data on biodegradation of naphthalene\r\nin biodegradability tests and natural systems suggest that biodegradation\r\noccurs after a relatively short period of acclimation. Methylnaphthalenes are\r\nbiodegraded under aerobic conditions after adaptation. The highest degradation\r\nrates were reported in water constantly polluted with petroleum.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Naphthalene biodegradation rates are about 8\u201320 times higher in\r\nsediment than in the water column above the sediment. Methylnaphthalenes\r\nbiodegrade more slowly. Reported half-lives in sediments were 46 weeks for\r\n1-methylnaphthalene and ranged from 14 to 50 weeks for 2-methylnaphthalene.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In soils, biodegradation potential is important to biological\r\nremediation of soil. Studies on biodegradation of PAHs suggest that adsorption\r\nto the organic matter significantly reduces the bioavailability for\r\nmicroorganisms, and thus the biodegradability, of PAHs, including naphthalene.\r\nBiodegradation is accomplished through the action of aerobic microorganisms and\r\ndeclines precipitously when soil conditions become anaerobic. Studies indicate\r\nthat naphthalene biodegrades to carbon dioxide in aerobic soils, with\r\nsalicylate as an intermediate product. Abiotic degradation of naphthalene\r\nseldom occurs in soils. The behavior of 1-methylnaphthalene in sandy loam was\r\nvery similar to that of naphthalene. 1-Methylnaphthalene was easily volatilised\r\nfrom aerated soil, and the biodegradation half-life averaged between \u00a01.7\r\nand 2.2 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acute toxicity data on naphthalene are available for several fish\r\nspecies (freshwater and marine). If low reliable data (too old, static test,\r\nnominal concentrations) are excluded, 96h LC50 values range from 1.8 to 7.8\r\nmg/L.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of naphthalene vapour has been associated with headache, loss of appetite and nausea. Other conditions associated with exposure to the vapour include optic neuritis, corneal injury and kidney damage. Animals exposed to aerosols of a refined commercial solvent mixture consisting primarily of mono-methylated naphthalenes, exhibited dyspnoea. When animals were exposed to this mixture for 27 daily one-hour exposures over a 35-day period, they showed dyspnoea, listlessness, prostration and marked salivation. Weight loss was evident in mice but not in other species. Pathological changes occurred in the lungs, liver and skin. Pulmonary changes consisted mainly of oedema, bronchopneumonia, emphysema, and thickening of the parabronchiolar alveolar septa.

                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material is not thought to be a skin irritant (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Abrasive damage however, may result from prolonged exposures. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Workers sensitised to naphthalene and its congeners show exfoliative dermatitis. Hypersensitivity, with positive patch tests, has been demonstrated in certain individuals. Percutaneous absorption is apparently inadequate to produce acute systemic reactions, except in new-born babies. Tests with a refined commercial liquid grade of methylnaphthalene (MN), placed under a patch for 48 hours on human skin produced slight to moderate reactions. In rabbits, a single dermal exposure to MN produced loss of appetite (anorexia). Repeated application of the refined commercial grade of MN to rabbit skin at 1-4 mg/kg/day for up to 21 days produced severe skin irritation and necrosis. Anorexia, moderate weight loss and fatalities were also recorded. Pathological changes in one animal were identified in the liver, stomach, heart, bone marrow, spleen, thyroid and thigh muscle. In another animal there was moderate hyperplasia of the bone marrow and thyroid. Photosensitisation has been recorded amongst workers exposed to naphthalene.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of naphthalene and its congeners may produce abdominal cramps with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, profuse perspiration, listlessness, confusion, and in severe poisonings, coma with or without convulsions. Irritation of the urinary bladder may also occur (presumably due to the excretory products of naphthalene metabolism) and produce urgency, dysuria, and the passage of brown or black urine with or without albumin or casts. These effects may disappear within a few days and have not been associated with haemolysis which is a prominent finding in naphthalene poisoning. Severe naphthalene poisoning in humans produces haemoglobinuria, methaemoglobinaemia, the production of Heinz bodies and death. Methaemoglobinemia produces a form of oxygen starvation (anoxia). Symptoms include cyanosis (a bluish discolouration skin and mucous membranes) and breathing difficulties. Symptoms may not be evident until several hours after exposure. At about 15% concentration of blood methaemoglobin there is observable cyanosis of the lips, nose and earlobes. Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor. Above 60% symptoms include dyspnea, respiratory depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, and convulsions. Levels exceeding 70% may be fatal. In those who survive haemotoxic effects, life-threatening acute renal failure, secondary to renal blockade, occurs. The acute lethal dose of naphthalene is estimated to be between 5 and 15 grams, although certain susceptible individuals have died after ingestion of a total dose of 2 grams. Hypersusceptibility, based on congenital deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, has been identified and is more common amongst Asians, Arabs, Caucasians of Latin ancestry and American and African blacks; males in particular are sensitive.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis. The material did not appear to be absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantity to produce outward signs of toxicity.</p>",
