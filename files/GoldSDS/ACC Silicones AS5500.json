                "Environment": "<p>For methyltriacetoxysilane:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>\u00a0The melting point of methyltriacetoxysilane is 41 deg C and the boiling point is 220 deg C at 1013 hPa. The vapor pressure is 0.26 hPa at 20 deg C. The estimated water solubility of methyltriacetoxysilane is 91 g/L; the estimated log Kow is 0.25. The water solubility and log Kow values may not be reliable because the chemical is hydrolytically unstable. The atmospheric half-life based only on photodegradation (i.e., reaction with hydroxyl radical) is 58 days. The atmospheric half-life based on photodegradation and hydrolysis is &lt;2 min. However, photodegradation as a mode of removal is unlikely because methyltriacetoxysilane is highly reactive and hydrolytically unstable, such that acetic acid and methylsilanetriol are rapidly generated upon contact with water or water vapor. Consequently, reaction with water vapor is likely the predominant degradation process for methyltriacetoxysilane in air. The vapor pressure indicates that methyltriacetoxysilane resides in the atmosphere and may undergo photodegradation due to ozone and/or hydroxyl radicals. Due to the very fast hydrolysis, the substance is not expected to reside in air and vapor pressure of the substance may not be relevant.</p> <p>Methyltriacetoxysilane is hydrolytically unstable over a range of environmentally relevant pH and temperature conditions. At pH 7, the half-life is = &lt;12 seconds. Rapid hydrolysis of this material produces acetic acid and trisilanols.</p> <p>Methyltriacetoxysilane is likely to be readily biodegradable based on results with a close structural analog, ethyltriacetoxysilane; however these materials rapidly hydrolyse and generate 3 moles of acetic acid for every mole of parent material. Thus, the biodegradation observed is likely reflective of the hydrolysis product, acetic acid. The biodegradation rate for acetic acid after 14 days under aerobic conditions is 74%. Bioaccumulation is not anticipated since this material is hydrolytically unstable.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute aquatic toxicity studies are available from two structural analogs, ethyltriacetoxysilane, and vinyltriacetoxysilane, as well as the primary hydrolysis product, acetic acid. The 96-hour LC50 of ethyltriacetoxysilane for\u00a0<i>Brachydanio rerio\u00a0</i>is 251 mg/L (the test media was not neutralized). The 96-hour LC50 of vinyltriacetoxysilane for\u00a0<i>Oncorhyncus mykiss\u00a0</i>is 51 mg/L and for\u00a0<i>Lepomis macrochirus\u00a0</i>is 68 mg/L (in both cases the test media was not neutralised). The 72 hour LC50s for acetic acid are 75, 79-88 (pH &lt;5.9) and 251 mg/L (several species of fish). The 48 hour EC50 of ethyltriacetoxysilane is 62 mg/L for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>. The 48 hour EC50 of vinyltriacetoxysilane is 100 mg/L for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna\u00a0</i>(the test media was not neutralised).</p> <p>Under static conditions, the 48 hour EC50 value for acetic acid is 65 mg/L for aquatic invertebrates (the test media was not neutralised). When the test solutions are neutralised, the static 48 hour EC50 for acetic acid is 6000 mg/L. In renewal systems with aquatic invertebrates, 48 hour EC50s for acetic acid are 100 mg/L and 180 mg/L. Ethyltriacetoxysilane toxicity to\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus\u00a0</i>provided a 72 hour EC50 of 73 and 76 mg/L for biomass and growth rate, respectively (the test media was not neutralized). When results are expressed on the basis of the amount of acetic acid generated from the hydrolysis reaction, the toxicity of the parent material is comparable to the reported toxicity of acetic acid (EC50\u00a0= 50-450 mg/L, depending on test species). Studies have been performed with a silanol monomer, trimethylsilanol (CAS No. 1066-40-6). Although this silanol is not expected to be produced following hydrolysis of methyltriacetoxysilane. A semistatic 96h study with trimethylsilanol and rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) resulted in a No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) of 128 mg/L and an LC50\u00a0of 271 mg/L.</p> <p>Methyltriacetoxysilane undergoes rapid hydrolysis in moist/aqueous environments (t1/2 is less than 12 seconds) to acetic acid and the corresponding trisilanols, thus observed toxicity is likely due primarily to acetic acid. Abiotic hydrolysis products undergo continuous, condensation reactions to produce higher molecular weight cyclic and linear siloxanes (the number-average and weight-average molecular weights (MW) were determined to be 1247 and 6208, respectively, with 69% of the chromatogram represented by a MW range higher than 1000 at the 1-hr reaction time; at the 4-hr reaction time, the number-average and weight-average molecular weights increased to 1629 and 152600 with 77% of the chromatogram higher than 1000 molecular weight, respectively).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of quantities of liquid mist may be extremely hazardous, even lethal due to spasm, extreme irritation of larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema.</p>",

Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia.

These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",
