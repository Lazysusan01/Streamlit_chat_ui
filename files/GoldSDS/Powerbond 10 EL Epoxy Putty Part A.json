Ethyloxirane may also be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition processes, considering its relatively high water solubility.</p> <p><b>Persistence:\u00a0</b>The half-life in air is about 5.6 days from the reaction of ethyloxirane with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals which indicates that this chemical meets the persistence criterion in air (half-life of = 2 days)*.</p> <p>Ethyloxirane is hydrolysable, with a half-life of 6.5 days, and biodegradable up to 100% degradation and is not expected to persist in water. A further model-predicted biodegradation half-life of 15 days in water \u00a0was obtained and used to predict the half-life of this chemical in soil and sediment by applying Boethling's extrapolation factors ( t1/2water : t1/2 soil : t1/2sediment = 1: 1: 4 ) (Boethling 1995). According to these values, it can be concluded that ethyloxirane does not meet the persistence criteria in water and soil (half-lives = 182 days) and sediments (half-life = 365 days).</p> <p>Experimental and modelled log Kow values of 0.68 and 0.86, respectively, indicate that the potential for bioaccumulation of ethyloxirane in organisms is likely to be low. Modelled bioaccumulation -factor (BAF) and bioconcentration -factor (BCF) values of 1 to 17 L/kg indicate that ethyloxirane does not meet the bioaccumulation criteria (BCF/BAF = 5000)*</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Experimental ecotoxicological data for ethyloxirane (OECD 2001) indicate low to moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms. For fish and water flea, acute LC50/EC50 values vary within a narrow range of 70-215 mg/L; for algae, toxicity values exceed 500 mg/L, while for bacteria they are close to 5000 mg/L\u00a0</p> <p><i><br /></i></p> <p><i>* Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</i>\u00a0(Canada 2000).</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental\r\ntoxicity is a function of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Pow,\r\nlog Kow).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For epichlorohydrin</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 0.08 ppm</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for epichlorohydrin, measuring in excess of 5 ppm, are commercially available.</p> <p>Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to minimise the potential for adverse respiratory, liver, kidney effects.

Oxiranes (including glycidyl ethers and alkyl oxides, and epoxides) exhibit common characteristics with respect to environmental fate and ecotoxicology. One such oxirane is ethyloxirane and data presented here may be taken as representative.</p> <p>for 1,2-butylene oxide (ethyloxirane):</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b>Ethyloxirane is highly soluble in water and has a very low soil-adsorption coefficient, which suggests that if released to water, adsorption of ethyloxirane to sediment and suspended solids is not expected. Volatilisation of ethyloxirane from water surfaces would be expected based on the moderate estimated Henry's Law constant. If ethyloxirane is released to soil, it is expected to have low adsorption and thus very high mobility. Volatilisation from moist soil and dry soil surfaces is expected, based on its vapour pressure. It is expected that ethyloxirane exists solely as a vapour in ambient atmosphere, based on its very high vapour pressure. Ethyloxirane may also be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition processes, considering its relatively high water solubility.</p> <p><b>Persistence:\u00a0</b>The half-life in air is about 5.6 days from the reaction of ethyloxirane with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals which indicates that this chemical meets the persistence criterion in air (half-life of = 2 days)*.</p> <p>Ethyloxirane is hydrolysable, with a half-life of 6.5 days, and biodegradable up to 100% degradation and is not expected to persist in water. A further model-predicted biodegradation half-life of 15 days in water \u00a0was obtained and used to predict the half-life of this chemical in soil and sediment by applying Boethling's extrapolation factors ( t1/2water : t1/2 soil : t1/2sediment = 1: 1: 4 ) (Boethling 1995). According to these values, it can be concluded that ethyloxirane does not meet the persistence criteria in water and soil (half-lives = 182 days) and sediments (half-life = 365 days).</p> <p>Experimental and modelled log Kow values of 0.68 and 0.86, respectively, indicate that the potential for bioaccumulation of ethyloxirane in organisms is likely to be low. Modelled bioaccumulation -factor (BAF) and bioconcentration -factor (BCF) values of 1 to 17 L/kg indicate that ethyloxirane does not meet the bioaccumulation criteria (BCF/BAF = 5000)*</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Experimental ecotoxicological data for ethyloxirane (OECD 2001) indicate low to moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms. For fish and water flea, acute LC50/EC50 values vary within a narrow range of 70-215 mg/L; for algae, toxicity values exceed 500 mg/L, while for bacteria they are close to 5000 mg/L\u00a0</p> <p><i><br /></i></p> <p><i>* Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</i>\u00a0(Canada 2000).</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental\r\ntoxicity is a function of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Pow,\r\nlog Kow).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For epichlorohydrin</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 0.08 ppm</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for epichlorohydrin, measuring in excess of 5 ppm, are commercially available.</p> <p>Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to minimise the potential for adverse respiratory, liver, kidney effects.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Those glycidyl ethers that have been investigated in long  term studies exhibit more or less marked carcinogenic potential.  Alkylating agents may damage the stem cell which acts as the precursor  to components of the blood. Loss of the stem cell may result in  pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and  platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the  individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular  leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder  involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red  blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest. Aplastic  anaemia develops due to complete destruction of the stem cells.<br />Reported  adverse effects in laboratory animals include sensitization, and skin  and eye irritation, as well as mutagenic and tumorigenic activity..<br />Testicular  abnormalities (including testicular atrophy with decreased  spermatogenic activity) following exposure to glycidyl ethers\u00a0 have been  reported. Haemopoietic abnormalities following exposure to glycidyl  ethers, including alteration of the leukocyte count, atrophy of lymphoid  tissue, and bone marrow cytotoxicity have also been reported. These  abnormalities were usually observed along with pneumonia and/or toxemia,  and therefore may be secondary effects. However, especially in light of  the generalized reduction in leukocytes and the atrophy of lymphoid  tissues, the observed haemopoietic abnormalities may have been  predisposing factors to pneumonia. While none of the individual research  reports are conclusive with respect to the ability of glycidyl ethers  to produce permanent changes to the testes or haemopoietic system in  laboratory animals, the pattern of displayed effects is reason for  concern<br />Glycidyl ethers have been shown to cause allergic contact  dermatitis in humans. Glycidyl ethers generally cause skin sensitization  in experimental animals. Necrosis of the mucous membranes of the nasal  cavities was induced in mice exposed to allyl glycidyl ether. \u00a0<br />A  study of workers with mixed exposures was inconclusive with regard to  the effects of specific glycidyl ethers. Phenyl glycidyl ether, but not  n-butyl glycidyl ether, induced morphological transformation in  mammalian cells in vitro. n-Butyl glycidyl ether induced micronuclei in  mice in vivo following intraperitoneal but not oral administration.  Phenyl glycidyl ether did not induce micronuclei or chromosomal  aberrations in vivo or chromosomal aberrations in animal cells in vitro.  Alkyl C12 or C14 glycidyl ether did not induce DNA damage in cultured  human cells or mutation in cultured animal cells. Allyl glycidyl ether  induced mutation in Drosophila. The glycidyl ethers were generally  mutagenic to bacteria.</p> <p>Respiratory sensitisation may result in allergic/asthma like responses; from coughing and minor breathing difficulties to bronchitis with wheezing, gasping.</p>",

It is not\r\nbiodegradable. Due to its insolubility in water there is a separation at every\r\nfiltration and sedimentation process.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Crystalline and/or amorphous silicas are ubiquitous on the earth\r\nin soils and sediments, and in living organisms (e.g. diatoms), but only the\r\ndissolved form is bioavailable. On a global scale, the level of man-made\r\nsynthetic amorphous silicas (SAS) represents up to 2.4% of the dissolved silica\r\nnaturally present in the aquatic environment. The rate of SAS released into the\r\nenvironment during the product life cycle is negligible in comparison with the\r\nnatural flux of silica in the environment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Untreated SASs have a relatively low water solubility of 1.91 to\r\n2.51 mmol/l (114 - 151 mg/l) and an extremely low vapour pressure (e.g. &lt;\r\n10\u20133 Pa at 20\u00b0 C for Aerosil R972). On the basis of these properties it is\r\nexpected that SAS released into the environment will be distributed mainly into\r\nsoil/sediment, slightly into water, and probably not at all into air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With surface-treated SASs, the addition of organosilicon compounds\r\nincreases the hydrophobicity. Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low. Due to the\r\npresence of organic substances such as surfactants, salts, acids and alkalis in\r\nthe environment, it is expected that surface-treated silica will be wetted and\r\nthen adsorbed onto soils or sediments</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SAS is regarded as an inert substance and is not expected to\r\nundergo any transformation in the atmospheric or terrestrial compartment, apart\r\nfrom dissolution by water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradability in sewage treatment plant or in surface water is\r\nnot applicable to inorganic substances like SAS. Therefore the biodegradation\r\nendpoint has limited relevance for SAS. In surface modified SASs, the most\r\ncommon treating agents are organosilicon compounds and these generally\r\nrepresent less than 5% of the material. Biodegradation in sewage treatment\r\nplant or in surface water is not expected. Some biodegradation in soil may\r\noccur by analogy with the behaviour of linear polydimethylsiloxane in this\r\ncompartment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on available data, SAS is not toxic to environmental\r\norganisms (apart from physical desiccation in insects).

The observed\r\neffects were likely caused by physical hampering of the\u00a0<i>Daphnia\u00a0</i>due\r\nto the presence of undissolved particles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A surface-treated SAS (Aerosil R974; 99.9% pure) was tested on\r\nfish and crustaceans.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>The synthetic, amorphous silicas are believed to represent a very greatly reduced silicosis hazard compared to crystalline silicas and are considered to be nuisance dusts.</p> <p>When heated to high temperature and a long time, amorphous silica can produce crystalline silica on cooling. Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p>",
