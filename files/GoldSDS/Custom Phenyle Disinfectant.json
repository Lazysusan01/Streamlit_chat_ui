It will also be scavenged by rain and oxidized by metal cations in rainwater and fogwater. Biodegradation will generally be the dominant loss mechanism when 3-cresol is released into water, and half-lives in most surface waters would range from hours to days. Longer half-lives would occur in oligotrophic lakes and marine waters. Volatilization, bioconcentration in fish, and adsorption to sediment will be unimportant and photolysis is only expected to be important in surface waters of oligotrophic lakes. Its fate in soil has not been well characterized It is relatively mobile in most soils and will biodegrade (100% in 11 days).\u00a0</p> <p><b>Terrestrial Fate</b>: 3-Cresol is mobile in soil and therefore it has the potential to leach into ground water. It biodegrades rapidly in soil, with one investigator reporting complete degradation in 11days. In the subsurface environment, 3-cresol biodegrades on the time scale of weeks to months .</p> <p><b>Aquatic Fate:</b>\u00a0The primary removal mechanism for 3-cresol in most surface waters is biodegradation with half-lives in estuarine waters of several days. The half-lives are shorter in freshwater and longer in marine waters. In oligotrophic lakes, photolysis may contribute to the removal process but experimental data are lacking. Also, while oxidation by metal ions such as Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV) occurs, it is not clear whether these processes contribute significantly to the degradation of 3-cresol in eutrophic waters. Degradation under anaerobic conditions is much slower, weeks rather than hours in screening studies, but there are insufficient data from natural systems to estimate degradation rates.</p> <p><b>Atmospheric Fate:</b>\u00a0The photochemical half-life of 3-cresol during the daytime is 8 hr while at night it is 5 min. The dominant reactions are with hydroxyl radicals during the day and with NO, radical at night. Daytime half-lives will be reduced under smog conditions. In addition, oxidation by metal ions such as Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV) may occur rapidly (hours or less) in rainwater and fogwater. 3-Cresol is highly soluble in water and it will be scavenged from the atmosphere by rain.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:</b>\u00a03-Cresol generally biodegrades rapidly in screening studies using soil, sewage, activated sludge, or freshwater inocula\u00a0</p> <p>Acclimation is frequently not necessary . Die-away studies were performed in freshwater, estuarine water, and marine water from sites near Newport, NC throughout the year . In estuarine water, the half-life ranged from 1 to 6 days . Rates were faster in freshwater and slower in marine water \u00a0While rates were highest during the summer in fresh and. estuarine waters, the rate of degradation in marine water was almost independent of the season . In an older die-away study in river water, 99-100% degradation was reported in 1 and 2 days at 4 and 20 C, respectively .</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): 15-50 mg/L</p> <p>Toxicity invertebrate: cell mult. inhib.17-33mg/L</p> <p>Bioaccumulation \u00a0: not sig</p> <p>Nitrif. inhib. \u00a0: 75% inhib at 11-16mg/L</p> <p>Environmental toxicity is a function of the n-octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Pow, log Kow). Phenols with log Pow &gt;7.4 are expected to exhibit low toxicity to aquatic organisms. However the toxicity of phenols with a lower log Pow is variable, ranging from low toxicity (LC50 values &gt;100 mg/l) to highly toxic (LC50 values &lt;1 mg/l) dependent on log Pow, molecular weight and substitutions on the aromatic ring. Dinitrophenols are more toxic than predicted from QSAR estimates.

Signs and symptoms may appear within 20-30 minutes including headache, nausea, shock, hypothermia, unconsciousness, respiratory failure, stomach upset, depression, dizziness, mental confusion, irregular and rapid breathing, weak pulse, muscle weakness, cloudy vision and ringing in the ears. Poisoning may be fatal. The symptoms normally disappear after exposure stops. \u00a0Severe exposure may produce loss of consciousness, lung damage (oedema), damage to the kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen, and death. In extreme cases cresols are severe depressants of the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system, particularly the spinal cord.</p> <p>Inhalation of quantities of liquid mist may be extremely hazardous, even lethal due to spasm, extreme irritation of larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Pulmonary absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system.

Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Phenols may exhibit local anaesthetic properties and, in general, are central nervous system depressants at high concentrations. The dihydroxy derivatives act as simple phenols but their effects are largely limited to local irritation. Trihydroxy derivatives may reduce the oxygen content of blood at sufficient exposure levels. Methyl phenols (cresols) typically do not pose significant inhalation hazards due to relatively low vapour pressures and objectionable odours.

Liver and kidney damage may also ensue. Chronic phenol toxicity was first noted in medical personnel in the late 1800s when 5 and 10% phenol was used as a skin disinfectant. The term carbolic (phenol) marasmus was given to this syndrome.</p> <p>\u00a0Addition of structurally related phenolic compounds to the diet of Syrian golden hamsters induced forestomach hyperplasia and tumours. These compounds included 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxphenol (BHA) (CAS RN: 25013-16-5), 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TBMP) (29759-28-2) and p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) (98-54-4); less active were catechol (154-23-4), p-methylphenol (331-39-5), methylhydroquinone (MHQ) (95-71-6) and pyrogallol (87-66-1), whilst no activity was seen with resorcinol (108-46-3), hydroquinone (123-31-9), propylparaben (94-13-3) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (1948-33-0).</p> <p>\u00a0In autoradiographic studies, intake of BHA, TBMP, catechol, PMOP, PTBP and MHQ resulted in a significant increase in the labelling index of the forestomach epithelium, whilst PMOP induced epithelial damage and pyloric regenerative hyperplasia. Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant.

In addition it will be scavenged by rain and oxidized by metal cations in rainwater and fogwater. When released into water, biodegradation will generally occur within days. However, in surface layers of oligotrophic waters, photolysis may be important. Its fate in soil has not been well characterized; it is relatively mobile in most soils and will readily biodegrade (100% in 8 days).\u00a0</p> <p><b>Terrestrial Fate:</b>\u00a02-Cresol should be relatively mobile in most soils. An exception appears to be where iron oxide and pH levels are high. 2-Cresol biodegrades rapidly in water and there is evidence that it also biodegrades in soil. However, information on the biodegradation rate is lacking.</p> <p><b>Aquatic Fate:</b>\u00a0The primary removal mechanism in most surface waters will be biodegradation. The half-life for biodegradation in river water is reported to be 2 days, which is similar to the half-lives for other cresol isomers. Although this half-life is the result of only one study, results of aerobic screening studies for cresol isomers are similar and this would suggest that the biodegradation half-life in river water if fairly rapid. In an oligotrophic lake, photolysis may contribute to the disappearance of 2-cresol, but experimental data are lacking. While photolysis of 2-cresol is catalyzed by the presence of humic acids and it is oxidized by metal ions such as Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV), it is not clear that these processes contribute significantly to the degradation of 2-cresol in eutrophic waters. There is no evidence that biodegradation occurs under anaerobic conditions, but only a few reports are available. Evaporation and volatilization will not be important.</p> <p><b>Atmospheric Fate:</b>\u00a0The estimated photodegradation half-life of 2-cresol resulting from its reaction with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals is 9.6 hr. Its lifetime will be less under photochemical smog conditions. In the nighttime, its half-life will be extremely short, 2 min, due to its reaction with NO3 radicals. In addition oxidation by metal ions such as Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV) may rapidly occur (hours or less) in rainwater and fogwater. 2-Cresol is highly soluble in water and it will be scavenged from the atmosphere by rain .</p> <p><b>Bioconcentration:</b>\u00a0Using the log octanol-water partition coefficient of 1.95 , a bioconcentration factor of 18 is estimated . Therefore 2-cresol would not be expected to bioconcentrate significantly in fish.</p> <p><b>Soil Adsorption/Mobility:</b>\u00a0The value for Koc measured on Brookstone clay loam soil (pH 5.7) is 22 and that predicted from the water solubility is 18 . Koc's for phenols predicted from water solubilities are only good for soils with organic carbon contents greater than approx 0.5% . Adsorptivities are greater than predicted for soils with low organic carbon content because interactions such as H-bonding are dominant . On five fine-textured B horizon clay soils (pH 4.5-7.8), the distribution between soil and water ranged from 2.8 to 500 . For these subsurface soils, the levels of free iron oxide and pH were the key factors in determining adsorption capacity .</p> <p><b>Volatilization from Water/Soil:</b>\u00a02-Cresol has a low volatility from water, having a calculated Henry's Law constant of 1.6 x 10-6 atm-m3/mol . Such chemicals will partition into the water phase and volatilization will not be an important loss process</p> <p>Environmental toxicity is a function of the n-octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Pow, log Kow). Phenols with log Pow &gt;7.4 are expected to exhibit low toxicity to aquatic organisms. However the toxicity of phenols with a lower log Pow is variable, ranging from low toxicity (LC50 values &gt;100 mg/l) to highly toxic (LC50 values &lt;1 mg/l) dependent on log Pow, molecular weight and substitutions on the aromatic ring. Dinitrophenols are more toxic than predicted from QSAR estimates. Hazard information for these groups is not generally available.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Because phenol as a vapour, liquid or solid can penetrate the skin causing systemic effects, a skin notation is considered necessary. Although ACGIH has not recommended a STEL it is felt that ACGIH excursion limits (15 ppm limited to a total duration of 30 minutes with brief excursions limited to no more than 25 ppm) and NIOSH Ceiling values (15 minutes at 15.6 ppm) are sufficiently similar so as to provide the same margin of safety.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Acute cresol poisoning occurs from exposure by inhalation, combined with ingestion and skin absorption. \u00a0Acute exposure by all routes of absorption may cause muscular weakness, gastro-enteric disturbances, pancreas and spleen injury. Signs and symptoms may appear within 20-30 minutes including headache, nausea, shock, hypothermia, unconsciousness, respiratory failure, stomach upset, depression, dizziness, mental confusion, irregular and rapid breathing, weak pulse, muscle weakness, cloudy vision and ringing in the ears. Poisoning may be fatal. The symptoms normally disappear after exposure stops. \u00a0Severe exposure may produce loss of consciousness, lung damage (oedema), damage to the kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen, and death. In extreme cases cresols are severe depressants of the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system, particularly the spinal cord.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pulmonary absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Inhalation of phenol and some of its derivatives may produce profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis, hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hyperpnoea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema with pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Phenols may exhibit local anaesthetic properties and, in general, are central nervous system depressants at high concentrations. The dihydroxy derivatives act as simple phenols but their effects are largely limited to local irritation. Trihydroxy derivatives may reduce the oxygen content of blood at sufficient exposure levels. Methyl phenols (cresols) typically do not pose significant inhalation hazards due to relatively low vapour pressures and objectionable odours. Substituted phenols produce similar effects to phenol although such effects may only be evident at high levels of exposure. Alkyl substitution tends to increase toxicity.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Some phenol derivatives may produce mild to severe damage within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hypernea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia.

Severe phenol ingestions cause hypotension, coma, ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures and white coagulative chemical burns.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Phenol does not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation like dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol and thus does not cause a heat exhaustion-like syndrome. Phenolic groups with ortho and para positions free from substitution are reactive; this is because the ortho and para positions on the aromatic ring are highly activated by the phenolic hydroxyl group and are therefore readily substituted.</p> <p>Several cases of ingestion have shown cresol to be corrosive to body tissues and to cause toxic effects on the vascular system, liver, kidneys and pancreas</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to the skin by cresol can cause facial peripheral nerve damage, impairment of renal function and even necrosis of the liver and kidneys.\u00a0</p> <p>Symptoms of chronic poisoning are abundant production of saliva, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, mental disturbances and fainting. \u00a0Contact dermatitis may also occur.</p> <p>Workers exposed to cresol vapour for 1.5 to 3 years experienced headaches that were frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms included elevated blood pressure, signs of impaired kidney function,blood calcium imbalance and marked tremors.</p> <p>Isomers of cresol are tumor promoters.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Prolonged exposure to some derivatives of phenol may produce dermatitis, anorexia, weight loss, weakness, muscle aches and pain, liver damage, dark urine, ochronosis, skin eruptions, diarrhoea, nervous disorders with headache, salivation, fainting, increased skin and scleral pigmentation, vertigo and mental disorders. Liver and kidney damage may also ensue. Chronic phenol toxicity was first noted in medical personnel in the late 1800s when 5 and 10% phenol was used as a skin disinfectant. The term carbolic (phenol) marasmus was given to this syndrome.</p> <p>\u00a0Addition of structurally related phenolic compounds to the diet of Syrian golden hamsters induced forestomach hyperplasia and tumours. These compounds included 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxphenol (BHA) (CAS RN: 25013-16-5), 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TBMP) (29759-28-2) and p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) (98-54-4); less active were catechol (154-23-4), p-methylphenol (331-39-5), methylhydroquinone (MHQ) (95-71-6) and pyrogallol (87-66-1), whilst no activity was seen with resorcinol (108-46-3), hydroquinone (123-31-9), propylparaben (94-13-3) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (1948-33-0).</p> <p>\u00a0In autoradiographic studies, intake of BHA, TBMP, catechol, PMOP, PTBP and MHQ resulted in a significant increase in the labelling index of the forestomach epithelium, whilst PMOP induced epithelial damage and pyloric regenerative hyperplasia. Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

It will also be scavenged by rain and oxidized by metal cations in rainwater and fogwater. Biodegradation is expected to be the dominant toss mechanism when 4-cresol is released into water. Volatilization, bioconcentration in fish, and adsorption to sediment will be unimportant and photolysis is only expected to be significant in surface waters of oligotrophic lakes. Experimental half-lives are only a few hours in eutrophic lakes and ponds but this may be preceded by an acclimation period ranging from hours to days. Half-lives in an oligotrophic lake, marine waters, and in water/sediment ecocores were 6, &lt;4, and &lt;2 days, respectively. Its fate in soil has not been extensively studied; it is relatively mobile in some soils and readily biodegrades (100% biodegradation in 7 days). Human exposure will primarily be via inhalation and dermal contact in the workplace or via inhalation in source areas.</p> <p><b>Terrestrial Fate:</b>\u00a04-Cresol is relatively mobile in some soils and, therefore, may leach into the ground water. It biodegrades rapidly in soil, with one investigator reporting complete degradation in 7 days.</p> <p><b>Aquatic Fate:</b>\u00a0A one-compartment computer model for 4-cresol predicts that following an acute discharge, the half-life would be 0.55 hr in a river, 12 hr in a pond or eutrophic lake, and 2400 hr in an oligotrophic lake . Biodegradation is predicted to be the dominant transformation process in eutrophic waters, but four times slower than photolysis in oligotrophic waters. Dilution is more important than biodegradation in rivers. Sorption and volatilization are unimportant in all waters. While photolysis is catalysed by the presence of humic acids, there are no experiments that evaluate whether this process is important in some eutrophic waters. Also, while oxidation by metal ions such as Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV) occurs, it is not clear whether these processes contribute significantly to the degradation of 4-cresol\u00a0</p> <p>in eutrophic waters. The model results are not entirely in agreement with experiments, where degradation half-lives were only a few hours in eutrophic waters but may be preceded by a lag period ranging from hours to days and where degradation occurred in an oligotrophic lakes in 6 days. In addition, half-lives in marine waters were 9-43 hr. In marine or freshwater/sediment ecocores, degradation is complete in a few days. Degradation is much slower under anaerobic conditions - weeks instead of hours in screening studies. However in the only study in a natural system, no mineralization occurred in 29 weeks in anaerobic lake sediment.</p> <p><b>Atmospheric Fate:</b>\u00a0The photochemical half-life of 4-cresol during the daytime is 10 hr while at night it is 4 min. The dominant reactions are with hydroxyl radical during daylight hours and with nitrate radicals at night Daytime half-lives will be reduced under smog conditions. 4-Cresol is highly soluble in water and it will be scavenged from the atmosphere by rain\u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:</b>\u00a04-Cresol has been shown to biodegrade rapidly in screening studies using soil, sewage, activated sludge, and freshwater inocula. Acclimation is frequently not necessary. Complete COD removal was obtained in a simulated biological treatment plant in 16-74 hr . 4-Cresol biodegrades rapidly in environmental waters including oligotrophic lakes, eutrophic ponds, rivers, creeks, and bays . Total degradation occurred in Lake Tahoe water within 6 days and 4 days, respectively, depending on whether the water contained sediment or not\u00a0</p> <p><b>Bioconcentration:</b>\u00a0Using the log octanol-water partition coefficient of 1.94, a bioconcentration factor of 18 is estimated. Therefore 4-cresol would not be expected to bioconcentrate significantly in fish.</p> <p><b>Soil Adsorption/Mobility:</b>\u00a0The value of Koc measured on Brookstone clay loam soil is 49, whereas that predicted from water solubility is 0.9 . Coyote Creek sediment Koc 650 . Based on this value, only 0.05, 0.3, and 0.1% would be sorbed in a one-compartment model of a oligotrophic lake, eutrophic pond, and river, respectively. On five fine-textured B horizon clay soils, the distribution between soil and water ranged from 5 to 50 . For these subsurface soils, the levels of free iron oxide and pH were the key factors in determining adsorption capacity . The Koc of 4-cresol to 3 subsoils (% organic carbon) was: Apison (0.11) - 3420; Fullerton (0.05) - 3350; and Dormont (1.2) - 115; Koc's for phenols predicted from water solubilities were only good for soils with organic carbon contents &gt;0.5% . Adsorptivities were much greater than predicted for soils with low organic carbon content because interactions such as H-bonding were dominant</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): 8.9-55.9 mg/L</p> <p>Toxicity invertebrate: cell mult. inhib.31-62mg/L</p> <p>Nitrif. inhib. \u00a0: 75% inhib at 11.4mg/L</p> <p>Anaerobic effects \u00a0: no degrad</p> <p>Effects on algae and plankton: cell mult. inhib. algae 13-15mg/L</p> <p>Environmental toxicity is a function of the n-octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Pow, log Kow).

However the toxicity of phenols with a lower log Pow is variable, ranging from low toxicity (LC50 values &gt;100 mg/l) to highly toxic (LC50 values &lt;1 mg/l) dependent on log Pow, molecular weight and substitutions on the aromatic ring.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours, aerosols (mists, fumes) or dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Acute cresol poisoning occurs from exposure by inhalation, combined with ingestion and skin absorption. \u00a0Acute exposure by all routes of absorption may cause muscular weakness, gastro-enteric disturbances, pancreas and spleen injury. Signs and symptoms may appear within 20-30 minutes including headache, nausea, shock, hypothermia, unconsciousness, respiratory failure, stomach upset, depression, dizziness, mental confusion, irregular and rapid breathing, weak pulse, muscle weakness, cloudy vision and ringing in the ears. Poisoning may be fatal. The symptoms normally disappear after exposure stops. \u00a0Severe exposure may produce loss of consciousness, lung damage (oedema), damage to the kidney, liver, pancreas and spleen, and death. In extreme cases cresols are severe depressants of the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system, particularly the spinal cord.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pulmonary absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Inhalation of phenol and some of its derivatives may produce profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis, hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hyperpnoea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema with pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Phenols may exhibit local anaesthetic properties and, in general, are central nervous system depressants at high concentrations. The dihydroxy derivatives act as simple phenols but their effects are largely limited to local irritation. Trihydroxy derivatives may reduce the oxygen content of blood at sufficient exposure levels. Methyl phenols (cresols) typically do not pose significant inhalation hazards due to relatively low vapour pressures and objectionable odours. Substituted phenols produce similar effects to phenol although such effects may only be evident at high levels of exposure. Alkyl substitution tends to increase toxicity.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Concentrated cresols instilled into the eyes of rabbits caused permanent opacification and vascularisation. A 33% solution applied as a drop to rabbit eyes and removed with irrigation within 60 seconds caused moderate and reversible injury</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Some phenol derivatives may produce mild to severe eye irritation with redness, pain and blurred vision. Permanent eye injury may occur; recovery may also be complete or partial.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may produce toxic effects; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material produces severe skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either:</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces severe inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant and severe inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> <li>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p> <p>Dilute cresol solutions cause redness, vesiculation and burning of the skin. Skin absorption produces toxic effects within 30 minutes.</p> <p>Phenol and some of its derivatives may produce mild to severe skin irritation on repeated or prolonged contact, producing second and third degree chemical burns. Rapid cutaneous absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Absorption through the skin may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hyperpnoea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Some phenol derivatives may produce mild to severe damage within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hypernea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Severe phenol ingestions cause hypotension, coma, ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures and white coagulative chemical burns.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Phenol does not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation like dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol and thus does not cause a heat exhaustion-like syndrome. Phenolic groups with ortho and para positions free from substitution are reactive; this is because the ortho and para positions on the aromatic ring are highly activated by the phenolic hydroxyl group and are therefore readily substituted.</p> <p>Several cases of ingestion have shown cresol to be corrosive to body tissues and to cause toxic effects on the vascular system, liver, kidneys and pancreas</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to the skin by cresol can cause facial peripheral nerve damage, impairment of renal function and even necrosis of the liver and kidneys.\u00a0</p> <p>Symptoms of chronic poisoning are abundant production of saliva, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, mental disturbances and fainting. \u00a0Contact dermatitis may also occur.</p> <p>Workers exposed to cresol vapour for 1.5 to 3 years experienced headaches that were frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms included elevated blood pressure, signs of impaired kidney function,blood calcium imbalance and marked tremors.</p> <p>Isomers of cresol are tumor promoters.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Prolonged exposure to some derivatives of phenol may produce dermatitis, anorexia, weight loss, weakness, muscle aches and pain, liver damage, dark urine, ochronosis, skin eruptions, diarrhoea, nervous disorders with headache, salivation, fainting, increased skin and scleral pigmentation, vertigo and mental disorders. Liver and kidney damage may also ensue. Chronic phenol toxicity was first noted in medical personnel in the late 1800s when 5 and 10% phenol was used as a skin disinfectant. The term carbolic (phenol) marasmus was given to this syndrome.</p> <p>\u00a0Addition of structurally related phenolic compounds to the diet of Syrian golden hamsters induced forestomach hyperplasia and tumours. These compounds included 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxphenol (BHA) (CAS RN: 25013-16-5), 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TBMP) (29759-28-2) and p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) (98-54-4); less active were catechol (154-23-4), p-methylphenol (331-39-5), methylhydroquinone (MHQ) (95-71-6) and pyrogallol (87-66-1), whilst no activity was seen with resorcinol (108-46-3), hydroquinone (123-31-9), propylparaben (94-13-3) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (1948-33-0).</p> <p>\u00a0In autoradiographic studies, intake of BHA, TBMP, catechol, PMOP, PTBP and MHQ resulted in a significant increase in the labelling index of the forestomach epithelium, whilst PMOP induced epithelial damage and pyloric regenerative hyperplasia. Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p>",
