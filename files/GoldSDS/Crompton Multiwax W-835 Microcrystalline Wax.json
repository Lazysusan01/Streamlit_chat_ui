Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

The half lives for degradation of these\r\nhydrocarbons by reaction with hydroxyl radicals, in the troposphere, under the\r\ninfluence of sunlight, will all be less than one day, by extrapolation from the\r\ndata quoted by Atkinson. Accordingly, any hydrocarbon material which does\r\npartition to air will be rapidly photodegraded</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As\r\nhydrocarbon number increases above C13, as is the case for the majority of the\r\nwax constituents, Log K values &gt;6 are predicted. Substances having Log K\r\nestimates greater than 6 are characterised by extremely large molecular weight\r\nand subsequent hydrophobicity, therefore no significant aqueous exposures or\r\nbioaccumulation are expected to occur.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since\r\nmolecular weight and structural conformation determines in large part the\r\nsolubility and vapour pressure characteristics of the hydrocarbons, modeling\r\nfocused on the lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. These would be selected C13\r\nand C20 hydrocarbons since waxes consist mostly of C20 to C85 compounds, with\r\nsome minimal percent of C13 through C20 hydrocarbons. Therefore, the majority\r\nof the physicochemical modeling was performed on various paraffinic, naphthenic\r\nand aromatic representatives containing 13 and C20 carbon atoms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">log Kow\r\nranged from 4.7 &gt;6.7</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water\r\nsolubility:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"> The water solubility of waxes cannot be\r\ndetermined due to their complex mixture characteristics. The highest\r\nsolubilities would be exhibited by only a small fraction of the hydrocarbon\r\nmolecules present in waxes. Increasing carbon number results in rapidly\r\ndecreasing solubility, so that the most-soluble (predominantly\r\nmethyl-substituted diaromatic) C18 and C20 analogues yield model values of\r\n0.01195 and 0.00125 mg/l, respectively. Higher molecular weight (higher carbon\r\nnumber) components are even less water soluble. Based on water solubility\r\nmodeling for C13 components of complex mixtures, aqueous solubilities of these\r\nwaxes are typically much less than 1 ppm, due to differential partitioning of\r\ncomponents between the aqueous and organic phases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrolysis:\r\n</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Materials in the waxes category are not subject to hydrolysis, as\r\nthey lack these reactive groups with which a water molecule or hydroxide ion\r\nreacts to form a new carbon-oxygen bond.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Photodegradation:\r\n</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Although waxes typically have low vapour pressures, volatilisation\r\nof some lower molecular weight components exhibit relatively high atmospheric\r\noxidation half-lives. Therefore, those compounds that may partition to the\r\natmosphere will be removed through indirect photochemical degradation. All\r\nmodeled components exhibited rapid degradation in the atmosphere; the value\r\npresented represents both the most volatile component and the longest modeled\r\nhalf-life. All other modeled C13 components had both lower volatility and\r\nshorter half-lives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Result : </span></b><span style=\"color:black\">t1/2 = 0.913 days (10.96 hr) for most volatile C13 component\r\nmodeled</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Transport\r\nbetween Environmental Compartments: </span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Fugacity-based\r\ncomputer modeling indicated that the majority of high molecular weight\r\nhydrocarbons with carbon numbers of C20 and greater in waxes would be\r\ndistributed to soil. Percent distribution estimates were modeled with C13 to\r\nC29 branched paraffins as this class of wax hydrocarbons shows the greater\r\ndistribution to air. Aromatic compounds with carbon numbers from C13 through\r\nC85 will partition principally to soil. Linear paraffins and naphthenes\r\ndistribute to both soil and air, with increasing partitioning to soil for\r\nhydrocarbons greater than C20 as vapour pressure decreases. Since the majority\r\nof hydrocarbon components in waxes are primarily normal paraffins of C20. and\r\ngreater, with moderate to minimal amounts of naphthenics, isoparaffins and\r\ntrace amounts of aromatics, volatility is not a significant fate process for\r\nthese petroleum substances due to negligible vapor pressures at ambient\r\ntemperatures and their high molecular weight.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Insoluble in water (0.6 mg/l),  freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, toluene and most other hydrocarbon solvents.|Antioxidant properties of BHT rely on its molecular configuration, because, like other synthetic phenolic antioxidants, it possesses a labile hydrogen atom in the hydroxy group that can be donated and reduce the free radicals generated at the initiation step of lipid oxidation. Thus, BHT itself is oxidized and the subsequent derived radical is stabilized by electronic delocalization in the benzene ring. This way, BHT can stop radical oxidation propagation, which retards lipid oxidation and extends food shelf-life. Several authors reported rapid loss of BHT at high temperatures (>140 C) and noticed lower antioxidant activity. This fact was attributed not only to the compound volatilization, but also to its transformation into metabolites.|BHT is included in the category of \"bridged alkyl phenols\"  for data purposes because it is an alkyl|phenol with a single carbon group such as the ones that link the phenol groups.",

Degradation of APEs in wastewater\r\ntreatment plants or in the environment generates more persistent shorter-chain\r\nAPEs and alkylphenols (APs) such as nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and AP\r\nmono- to triethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2 and NPE3). There is concern that APE\r\nmetabolites (NP, OP, NPE1-3) can mimic natural hormones and that the levels\r\npresent in the environment may be sufficient to disrupt endocrine function in\r\nwildlife and humans. The physicochemical properties of the APE metabolites (NP,\r\nNPE1-4, OP, OPE1-4), in particular the high Kow values, indicate that they will\r\npartition effectively into sediments following discharge from STPs. The aqueous\r\nsolubility data for the APE metabolites indicate that the concentration in\r\nwater combined with the high partition coefficients will provide a significant\r\nreservoir (load) in various environmental compartments. Data from studies\r\nconducted in many regions across the world have shown significant levels in\r\nsamples of every environmental compartment examined. In the US, levels of NP in\r\nair ranged from 0.01 to 81 ng/m3, with seasonal trends observed. Concentrations\r\nof APE metabolites in treated wastewater effluents in the US ranged from &lt;\r\n0.1 to 369 ug/l, in Spain they were between 6 and 343 ug/l and concentrations\r\nup to 330 ug/l were found in the UK. Levels in sediments reflected the high\r\npartition coefficients with concentrations reported ranging from &lt; 0.1 to\r\n13,700 ug/kg for sediments in the US. Fish in the UK were found to contain up\r\nto 0.8 ug/kg NP in muscle tissue. APEs degraded faster in the water column than\r\nin sediment. Aerobic conditions facilitate easier further biotransformation of\r\nAPE metabolites than anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenols are susceptible to photochemical degradation. Using\r\nnatural, filtered, lake water it was found that nonylphenol had a half-life of\r\napproximately 10-15 h under continuous, noon, summer sun in the surface water\r\nlayer, with a rate approximately 1.5 times slower at depths 20-25 cm.\r\nPhotolysis was much slower with ethoxylated nonylphenol, and so it is unlikely\r\nto be a significant event in removal of the ethoxylates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols released to the\r\natmosphere will exist in the vapour phase and is thought to be degraded by\r\nreaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, with a calculated\r\nhalf-life, for nonylphenol, of 0.3 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Abiotic degradation of\r\nalkylphenol is negligible. Biodegradation does not readily take place. The\r\nhalf-life in surface water may be around 30 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Degradation:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenol ethoxylates\r\n(APES) may abiotically degrade into the equivalent alkylphenol. During\r\ndegradation ethylene oxide units are cleaved off the ethylene oxide chain until\r\nonly short-chain alkylphenol ethoxylates remain, typically mono- and diethylene\r\noxides. Oxidation of these oligomers creates the corresponding carboxylic acids.\r\nThis leaves several degradation products: short-chain ethoxylates, their\r\ncarboxylic acids, and alkylphenols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Alkylphenols are not\r\nreadily biodegradable. Several mechanisms of microbial aromatic ring\r\ndegradation have been reported, the most common being formation of catechol\r\nfrom phenol, followed by ring scission between or adjacent to the two hydroxyl\r\ngroups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The full breakdown pathway for APES has not yet been determined,\r\nand all studies have so far focused on identification of intermediates in\r\nbacterial culture media, rather than studying cell-free systems or purified\r\nenzymes. It is, however, likely that microbial metabolism usually starts by an\r\nattack on the ethoxylate chain, rather than on the ring or the hydrophobic\r\nchain. The ethoxylate groups are progressively removed, either by ether\r\ncleavage, or by terminal alcohol oxidation followed by cleavage of the\r\nresulting carboxylic acid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation of APEs produces less biodegradable products:\r\nalkylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylates, alkylphenoxy acetic and\r\nalkylphenoxypolyethoxy acetic acids, and alkylphenols. These metabolites\r\nfrequently persist through sewage treatment and in rivers. Anaerobic conditions\r\ngenerally lead to the accumulation of alkylphenols. The rate of biodegradation\r\nseems to decrease with increasing length of the ethylene oxide chain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Metabolites of APES\r\naccumulate in organisms, with bioconcentration factors varying from ten to\r\nseveral thousand, depending on species, metabolite and organ.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The metabolites of APES are generally more toxic than the original\r\ncompounds. APES have LC50s above about 1.5 mg/l, whereas alkylphenols,such as\r\nnonylphenol, have LC50s are generally around 0.1 mg/l.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Oestrogenic activity:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The role\r\nof alkyl chain length and branching, substituent position, number of alkylated\r\ngroups, and the requirement of a phenolic ring structure was assessed in fish.\r\nThe results showed that most alkylphenols were oestrogenic, although with 3-300\r\nthousand times lower potency than the endogenous estrogen 17beta-estradiol.\r\nMono-substituted tertiary alkylphenols with moderate (C4-C5) and long alkyl\r\nchain length (C8-C9) in the para position exhibited the highest oestrogenic\r\npotency. Substitution with multiple alkyl groups, presence of substituents in\r\nthe ortho- and meta-position and lack of a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring\r\nreduced the oestrogenic activity, although several oestrogenic alkylated\r\nnon-phenolics were identified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Human exposure:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols were first\r\nfound to be oestrogenic (oestrogen-mimicking) in the 1930s, but more recent\r\nresearch has highlighted the implications of these effects. The growth of\r\ncultured human breast cancer cells is affected by nonylphenol at concentrations\r\nas low as 1 uM (220 ug/ l) or concentrations of octylphenol as low as 0.1 uM\r\n(20 ug/1). Oestrogenic effects have also been shown on rainbow trout\r\nhepatocytes, chicken embryo fibroblasts and a mouse oestrogen receptor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The insecticide chlordecone (Kepone) shows similar behaviour to\r\nalkylphenols, accumulating in liver and adipose tissue, and eliciting\r\noestrogenic activity. Workers exposed to this insecticide can suffer\r\nreproductive effects such as low sperm counts and sterility. In addition, the\r\noestrogenic effects of chlordecone on MCF7 cells occur at similar concentrations\r\nto those of alkylphenols, suggesting that alkylphenols will be a similar health\r\nhazard if target cells are exposed to uM levels of these compounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">By comparing environmental concentrations, bioconcentration\r\nfactors and\u00a0<i>in vitro\u00a0</i>oestrogenic effect levels, current\r\nenvironmental levels of alkylphenolic compounds are probably high enough to\r\naffect the hormonal control systems of some organisms.

Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
