                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of sulfamic acid may cause bloody spit, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, headache, dizziness, bluish skin colour and lung congestion.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Concentrated solutions may cause chemical burns. \u00a0The effects of sulfamic acid on the skin appear to be limited to the effects of low pH. Concentrations of greater than 20% of sulfamic acid may injure the skin.</p> <p>Repeated application of a 4% solution of sulfamic acid several times a day for 5 days on the skin produced mild irritation</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Solution of material in moisture on the skin, or perspiration, may markedly increase skin corrosion and accelerate tissue destruction</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Ingestion of sulfamic acid may cause vomiting, diarrhoea and a drop in blood pressure. Asphyxia may occur from oedema of the glottis. \u00a0After initial recovery, onset of fever indicates mediastinitis or peritonitis from perforation of the esophagus or stomach. Ingestion of greater than 10% solutions will cause lesions of the stomach.</p> <p>The material has\u00a0<font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>NOT</b></font>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by ingestion\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p>",

                "Use": "<p>alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) are useful building blocks in organic synthesis. For example, alpha-hydroxy acids are generally useful as precursors in the preparation aldehydes via oxidative cleavage. Compounds of this class are used on the industrial-scale and include glycolic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, and mandelic acid.] They are susceptible to acid-catalyzed decarbonylation to give, in addition to carbon monoxide, a ketone/aldehyde and water.<br />Although these compounds are related to the ordinary carboxylic acids, and therefore are weak acids, their chemical structure allows for the formation of an internal hydrogen bond between the hydrogen at the hydroxyl group and one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group. Two effects emerge from this situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the \"occupation\" of electrons of the carboxylic oxygens in the hydrogen bonding, the acidic proton is held less strongly, as the same electrons are used in bonding that hydrogen too. So the pKa of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is a full unit lower compared to that of propionic acid itself</li>\n<li>The internal bridging hydrogen is locked in its place on the NMR timescale: in mandelic acid (2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetic acid) this proton couples to the one on carbon in the same way and magnitude as hydrogens on geminal carbon atoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Racemic alpha-hydroxy acids are classically prepared by addition of hydrogen cyanide to a ketone or aldehyde, followed by acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile function of the resulting cyanohydrin product.<br />alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) are often found in products that aid in the reduction of wrinkles as well as to soften strong, defining lines and improve the overall look and feel of the skin. They are also used as chemical peels available in a dermatologist's office, beauty and health spas and home kits, which usually contain a lower concentration of around 4%. ..<br />AHAs most commonly used in cosmetic applications are typically similar to those found in food products including glycolic acid (found in sugar cane), lactic acid (found in sour milk), malic acid (found in apples), citric acid (found in citrus fruits) and tartaric acid (found in grape wine) - though the source of the AHAs in cosmetics is predominantly synthetic or from bacterial or fungal fermentations. For any topical compound to be effective, including AHA, it must penetrate into the skin where it can act on living cells. Bioavailability (influenced primarily by small molecular size) is an important factor in a compound's ability to penetrate the top layer of the skin. Glycolic acid, having the smallest molecular size, is the AHA with greatest bioavailability and penetrates the skin most easily; this largely accounts for the popularity of this product in cosmetic applications.<br />AHAs have a profound effect on keratinization; which is clinically detectable by the formation of a new stratum corneum. It appears that AHAs modulate this formation through diminished cellular cohesion between corneocytes at the lowest levels of the stratum corneum.<br />AHAs with greater bioavailability appear to have deeper dermal effects. Glycolic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid, on topical application to photodamaged skin, have been shown to produce increased amounts of mucopolysaccharides and collagen and increased skin thickness without detectable inflammation, as monitored by skin biopsies<br />alpha-Hydroxy acids (AHAs), are a class of chemical compounds that consist of a carboxylic acid substituted with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon.\u00a0</p>|As an organic acid cleaning agent, in metal finishing, copper brightening, smut removal, solder fluxes, electroplating, pickling, milling of metals. Used in the processing of textiles, leather and metals; in pH control.|A member f the so-called alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) family used in personal care products as  for uses such as treating acne, removing scars, and lightening discolorations. Among these are some products marketed as \"skin peelers,\" which may contain relatively high concentrations of AHAs or other acids and are designed to remove the outer layer of the skin.",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> #CEL TWA: 10 mg/m3",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours, aerosols (mists, fumes) or dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>|Inhalation of concentrated mist may cause severe irritation with pain. Pulmonary oedema may result from acute excessive exposure.",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Irritation of the eyes may produce a heavy secretion of tears (lachrymation).</p> <p>Dilute solutions of low-molecular organic acids cause conjunctival hyperaemia, prompt pain and corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to produce harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives using animal models). Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>Ingestion of low-molecular organic acid solutions may produce spontaneous haemorrhaging, intravascular coagulation, gastrointestinal damage and oesophageal and pyloric stricture.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Reports suggest that methoxyacetic acid exposure may be absorbed through the skin and may produce abnormalities of the blood-forming system resulting in anaemia, or altered immune system function with increased susceptibility to disease.</p> <p>A metabolite of methoxyacetic acid is regarded as a potential male and female reproductive hazard and causes developmental abnormalities in animal testing [DuPont].</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p>|Glycolic acid may contain methoxyacetic acid as a contaminant.",
