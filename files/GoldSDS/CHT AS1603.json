                "Use": "<p>Siloxanes, the building blocks for silicone products, are widely used chemicals. The siloxanes are characterised by a high stability, physiologic inertness and good release and lubricating properties.</p> <p>Siloxanes are chemical compounds with a backbone of alternating silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms, each silicon atom bearing one or several organic groups. Siloxanes are building blocks for silicone products or make part of other products, such as cosmetics or paint. In colloquial language the term silicones is often used synonymously with siloxanes.</p> <p>The chemical names of the compounds most often include the string \"siloxane\", but in particular in cosmetics and toiletries names including methicone are used instead, e.g. dimethicone derived from dimethyl silicone; synonymous with dimethylsiloxane. Another used synonym is poly(oxy(methylsilylene)). To add to the confusion about the terms, several</p> <p>of the compounds are designated \"silicones and siloxanes\".</p> <p>The properties of the siloxanes and the silicone products depend on the length of the Si-O backbone, the chemical groups attached to the backbone and the presence of cross-links between the backbones.\u00a0</p> <p>The silicon and oxygen atoms may be linked into cyclic or linear structures, and are described as\u00a0<i>linear siloxanes\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>cyclic siloxanes</i>. The shorter linear polysiloxanes are, like some of the cyclic siloxanes, volatile.</p> <p>In linear siloxanes the end groups determine the use of the polymer. Typical end groups are methyl, hydroxyl, vinyl or hydrogen. For example vinyl- and hydroxyterminated polysiloxanes find major application in silicone elastomers. The side groups determine together with the end-groups the properties of the siloxanes. Phenyl side groups provide e.g. oxidative stability. Aminopropyl and polyether side groups provide water solubility, whereas the presence of alkyl groups enhances water repellency and lubricity. The presence of halogens in the side chains produces very stable polymers. Very high resistance to solvents can be obtained by using trifluoropropyl side chains, whereas lubricity at high temperatures is obtained by tetrachlorophenyl side groups\u00a0</p> <p>Silicone products are grouped into silicone fluids, elastomers and resins depending on the length of the backbone, the extent of crosslinking and the type and number of organic groups attached to the silicon atoms. Silicone fluids are used for a wide range of applications, silicone elastomers are mainly used for sealants and rubbers, and resins are mainly used for paints. The most common siloxanes are polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with different modifications.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also\r\nknown as dimethylpolysiloxane or dimethicone, belongs to a group of polymeric\r\norganosilicon compounds that are commonly referred to as silicones.\u00a0 PDMS is\r\nthe most widely used silicon-based organic polymer, and is particularly known\r\nfor its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. PDMS is optically clear, and,\r\nin general, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable. It is one of several types of\r\nsilicone oil (polymerized siloxane). Its applications range from contact lenses\r\nand medical devices to elastomers; it is also present in shampoos (as\r\ndimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), caulking,\r\nlubricants and heat-resistant tiles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">PDMS is hydrophobic\u00a0 The addition\r\nof silanol (SiOH) by oxidation, renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing\r\nwater to wet it. The surface can be further functionalized by reaction with\r\ntrichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface's\r\nhydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is\r\nvacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minute.</span></p> <p>Silicones generally increase in viscosity with increasing chain length. In silicone fluids, the number of dimethylsiloxane moieties (indicated by the \"n\" in the chemical formulae) is up to 4000 .</p> <p>Silicone fluids are distinguished from common organic fluids by a number of unique properties :</p> <ul> <li>Good thermal stability (150-200 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Good low-temperature performance (&lt;-70 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Strong hydrophobicity;\u00a0</li> <li>Excellent release properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Antifriction and lubricating properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Pronounced surface activity;\u00a0</li> <li>Good dielectric properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Very good damping behaviour;\u00a0</li> <li>Good radiation resistance;\u00a0</li> <li>High solubility of gases;\u00a0</li> <li>Physiological inertness;\u00a0</li> <li>Low temperature dependence of physical properties.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Because of these properties silicone fluids are widely applied as release agents for moulding operations, medical and cosmetic applications, polishes, coolants and dielectric fluids for electrical systems, metal processing fluids and agents for foam control. The silicone fluid may be formulated into emulsions, dispersions, greases and compounds.</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in specific circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or irritation of the respiratory tract (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The low vapour pressure of silicone fluids make exposures to potentially harmful vapours unlikely. The vapours of a low molecular weight member of this family, hexamethyldisiloxane, were tolerated by guinea pigs at concentrations of 25000 ppm for 30 minutes without apparent ill-effect. Higher saturated vapour concentrations (39000-40000 ppm) produced death in 15-20 minutes; deaths appeared to occur as a result of respiratory failure as animals removed from exposure, prior to death, almost always survived. Although animal studies show that silicone fluids are removed very slowly from the lungs, their presence is not expected to produce adverse effects; exposure to aerosols is unlikely to result in damage to the health. When heated at high temperatures, the fumes and oxidation products of methyl silicones can be both irritating and produce toxic effects following inhalation. Massive exposures of heated silicone oil can produce central nervous system depression leading to death.</p> <p>Not normally a hazard due to non-volatile nature of product</p>",

Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>When the eyes of human subjects where exposed to silicone fluids, there was evidence of transitory conjunctival irritation within a few hours; this resolved within 24 hours. When applied to the eyes of rabbits, silicone fluids produced transitory irritation which lasted no longer than 48 hours. Injection into the various structures of the eye of animals produced corneal scarring, degenerative changes in the retina, foreign body reaction and cataracts.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Low molecular weight silicone fluids may exhibit solvent action and may produce skin irritation.</p> <p>Excessive use or prolonged contact may lead to defatting, drying and irritation of sensitive skin</p>",

Aspiration of silicone fluids or emulsions may produce chemical pneumonitis.</p> <p>High molecular weight material; on single acute exposure would be expected to pass through gastrointestinal tract with little change / absorption.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Base material for high temperature mortars.|<p>Synthetic amorphous (non-crystalline) silica (SAS) can be divided into two groups according to whether the manufacturing process is by the wet route (precipitated silica, silica gel) or the thermal route (pyrogenic silica). Colloidal silicas (silica sols) are stable dispersions of SASs in a liquid, usually water. Furthermore, SASs, which are generally hydrophilic, may be rendered hydrophobic by surface treatment. SASs exist as highly pure, white, fluffy powders or milky-white dispersions of these powders in fluids (usually water).</p> <p>A significant proportion of the global production of SAS is rendered hydrophobic by surface modification mainly with Si-organic compounds. Surface modified (after-treated) SAS can be obtained either by physical or chemical reaction. The most common Si-organic compounds used for the treatment are hexamethyldisilazane (CAS No. 999-97-3), dimethyldichlorsilane (CAS No. 75-78-5) and polydimethylsiloxanes (e.g. CAS No. 9016-00-6). The first compound forms mono-functional moieties upon hydrolysis [(Si-O-Si(CH3)3], whereas the latter two give rise to bi-functional units [Si-O-[Si(CH3)2-O]x].\u00a0The surface treatment does not change the solid properties e.g. particle size, dissolution kinetics of the inorganic polymer silicon dioxide (silica, SiO2). However, surface treatment does alter physico-chemical properties, e.g. reduced moisture uptake.</p>",

Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low.

Indeed, once\r\nreleased and dissolved into the environment no distinction can be made between\r\nthe initial forms of silica. At normal environmental pH, dissolved silica\r\nexists exclusively as monosilicic acid [Si(OH)4]. At pH 9.4 the solubility of\r\namorphous silica is about 120 mg SiO2/l . Quartz has a solubility of only 6\r\nmg/l, but its rate of dissolution is so slow at ordinary temperature and\r\npressure that the solubility of amorphous silica represents the upper limit of\r\ndissolved silica concentration in natural waters. Moreover, silicic acid is the\r\nbioavailable form for aquatic organisms and it plays an important role in the\r\nbiogeochemical cycle of Si, particularly in the oceans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>In the oceans, the transfer of dissolved silica from the marine\r\nhydrosphere to the biosphere initiates the global biological silicon cycle.\r\nMarine organisms such as diatoms, silicoflagellates and radiolarians build up\r\ntheir skeletons by taking up silicic acid from seawater. After these organisms\r\ndie, the biogenic silica accumulated in them partly dissolves. The portion of\r\nthe biogenic silica that does not dissolve settles and ultimately reaches the\r\nsediment. The transformation of opal (amorphous biogenic silica) deposits in\r\nsediments through diagenetic processes allows silica to re-enter the geological\r\ncycle.

Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p> <p>Repeated exposure to synthetic amorphous silicas may produce skin dryness and cracking.</p> <p>\u00a0Available data confirm the absence of significant toxicity by oral and dermal routes of exposure.</p> <p>Numerous repeated-dose, subchronic and chronic inhalation toxicity studies have been conducted in a number of species, at airborne concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3. Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

Although the silane derivatives can be distilled under reduced pressure, acid impurities (e.g. 2-butanone oxide hydrochloride, produced during silane production), reduce thermal stability significantly.

The relationship between energy of decomposition and processing hazards has been the subject of discussion; it is suggested that values of energy released per unit of mass, rather than on a molar basis (J/g) be used in the assessment. For example, in \"open vessel processes\" (with man-hole size openings, in an industrial setting), substances with exothermic decomposition energies below 500 J/g are unlikely to present a danger, whilst those in \"closed vessel processes\" (opening is a safety valve or bursting disk) present some danger where the decomposition energy exceeds 150 J/g.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>BRETHERICK: Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 4th Edition</p> <ul> <li>Segregate from alcohol, water.\u00a0</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Avoid reaction with oxidising agents\u00a0</li> </ul> <ul> <li><b>NOTE:\u00a0</b>May develop pressure in containers; open carefully.

The spleen and liver showed evidence of compensatory red blood cell production suggesting that, in the rat, MEKO induces haemolytic anaemia with complementary erythropoiesis. A no-observed-effect-level was not established but effects at 25 mg/kg were described as minimal.</p> <p>When MEKO was administered to rats at dose levels of 0.5, and 1.0 ml/kg/day, daily for 4 weeks, transient central nervous system depression immediately followed. At 4 weeks dose-related decreases were seen in red blood cell count and haemoglobin. Dose-related increases were evident in spleen weight (from 1.7 to 3.2 fold). It was concluded that 0.1 ml/kg produced only minimal effects. When rats were exposed by inhalation to MEKO vapour for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, mild increases in blood mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, reticulocyte count and red blood cell count were seen at 533 and 714 ppm. Spleen weights were increased and haemosiderosis (deposits of iron) in the spleen were seen at 714 ppm.</p> <p>Haemosiderosis probably resulted from red blood cell haemolysis. Exposures at 60 and 283 ppm produced no observed effects.</p> <p>An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed microscopically in male mice exposed to 375 ppm for 18 months. Both male and female mice exposed at 375 ppm showed enlarged livers but tumours did not occur in females.</p> <p>There are generally two types of oximes: ketoximes derived from ketones and aldoximes derived form aldehydes. Several ketoximes (p-quinone dioxime, acetoxime and methyl ethyl ketoxime) have elicited carcinogenic effects on chronic exposure. Few substantive studies have been performed with aldoximes. The fact that aldoximes can be metabolised to cyanide via a pathway not applicable to ketoximes distinguishes the type of response which might be anticipated. Dehydration of aldoximes to produce nitriles has been shown to be catalysed in vitro by cytochrome P450; dehydration of ketoximes produces amides, rather than nitriles, via a Beckmann rearrangement but this apparently has no analogue in biological systems.</p> <p>The mechanism and toxicity of oximes to erythrocytes is recognised and might be attributed to hydroxylamine, a product of hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine produces haematologic effects such as methaemoglobinaemia and splenomegaly in mice similar to those observed after exposure to oximes such as butanal oxime. Studies demonstrated the formation of haeme-associated free radicals in erythrocytes exposed to hydroxylamine, leading ultimately to peroxidation of membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes may produce several morphological alterations resulting, for example, in membrane aggregation, deformation or breakage. This may result in the release of hydrolytic enzymes which in turn may degrade functional macromolecules and cause secondary damage. In addition membrane-bound enzyme systems may be disrupted. Levels of hydroxylamine produced as a result of hydrolysis are thought to be too low to produce another sign of hydroxylamine toxicity, namely the formation of Heinz bodies</p> <p>Oximes are not easily oxidised at near neutral conditions and hydrolysis by liver microsomes or S9 is hypothesised (however this conclusion was based on the formation of a ketone rather than hydroxylamine). Another possibility is that oximes are oxidatively metabolised to yield a ketone or aldehyde and some yet to be determined nitrogen-containing species. Cytochrome P450 appears to provide a source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide which catalyses oxidation in the presence of iron. \u00a0At least part of the nitrogen in the oxime is converted to nitric oxide which complexes with haeme to give a nitrosylhaemoglobin complex.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

As a practical\r\nalternative to Stille and Suzuki coupling, the rhodium-catalyzed addition of\r\ntrialkoxysilanes to carbonyl compounds has received a considerable amount of\r\nattention.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The use of silicon compounds as\r\ntransmetalation reagents has attracted much attention as a viable alternative\r\nto the popular Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions, mainly due to the\r\nformation of nontoxic byproducts and the stability of the reagents to many reaction\r\nconditions. Silicon-based coupling reactions can be carried out using aryl,\r\nheteroaryl, or alkenyl halides and alkoxysilanes in the presence of palladium\r\nor rhodium catalysts.</span></p> <p>Alkoxysilanes are a family of monomeric molecules which react with water to form, typically, an alkylpolysiloxane (alkyl orthosilicate).</p> <p>Formulators in the paint, ink, adhesives, water repellents, and other related industries require materials that resist peeling and penetration in spite of prolonged exposure to heat, cold, moisture, and chemical attack. Research into these problems resulted in the development of alkoxy functional silanes for use as adhesion promoters, crosslinkers, and hydrophobes. The ability of silane added to a coating formulation to migrate to the substrate interface and improve bonding is well known. In addition, silanes have been added to lattices and hydrolysed to form an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) polymer with improved properties. Possessing both organic and inorganic properties, these hybrid chemicals react with the polymer and mineral components (such as aluminium, zirconium etc. oxides), contained in the polymer mix, forming durable covalent bonds across the interface.</p> <p>Often the silane is subjected to hydrolysis prior to the surface treatment. Following hydrolysis, a reactive silanol group is formed, which can condense with other silanol groups, for example, those on the surface of siliceous fillers, to form siloxane linkages. An alkyl alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol is also produced and may enter the atmosphere thus compromising the health of the worker. Hydroxyl groups on the substrate surface form hydrogen bond with the silanols which in turn lose water to form a covalent, permanent ether linkage Sufficient water for hydrolysis may be available from atmospheric moisture, or on the substrate surface.

Small aliphatic amines display significant\r\nsolubility in many solvents, whereas those with large substituents are\r\nlipophilic.

Alkoxysilanes are used as coupling agents and are designed to hydrolyse.</p> <p>Hydrolysis generally produces biodegradable alcohols.</p> <p>Parameters controlling intrinsic stability and reactivity of organosilanols generated from alkoxysilanes in aqueous environments have been elucidated in several experiments. The studies indicate that the rates of hydrolysis of alkoxysilanes are generally related to their steric bulk, but demonstrate that after rate-limiting hydrolysis of the first alkoxy group steric effects are much less important.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Microbial methylation plays important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of the \u00a0metalloids and possibly in their detoxification. Many microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts) and animals are now known to biomethylate arsenic, forming both volatile (e.g., methylarsines) and nonvolatile (e.g., methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) compounds. \u00a0Antimony and bismuth, also undergo biomethylation to some extent. Trimethylstibine formation by microorganisms is now well established, but this process apparently does not occur in animals. Formation of trimethylbismuth by microorganisms has been reported in a few cases.</p> <p>For 3-aminopropyltriethoxsilane (APTES):</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The estimated partition coefficient Log Kow is 0.31 and the estimated water solubility is 7.6x10+5 mg/l; these values may not be applicable because the material is hydrolytically unstable. The vapor pressure is 0.02 hPa at 20 C, the melting point is -70 C, and the boiling point is 223 C at 1013 hPa. Photodegradation modeling indicates the halflife in the atmosphere due to the reaction with photochemically induced OH radicals to be approximately 2.4 hours. However, photodegradation as a mode of removal is unlikely and not expected to be a significant degradation process because APTES is hydrolytically unstable.</p> <p>APTES is hydrolytically unstable (t1/2 &lt; 1 hour) over a range of environmentally relevant pH and temperature conditions, with the exception of pH 7 at 10 or 24.7 C. At pH 7, the half-life is 56 or 8.4 hours, for 10 or 24.7 C, respectively. Rapid hydrolysis of this material produces ethanol and trisilanols. The Si-C bond will not further hydrolyze. That bond is hydrolytically stable and the aminopropyl group will not be cleaved. Only the ethoxy groups will be hydrolysed. The transient silanol groups will condense with other silanols. As a result, aminopropyl-functional resins are generated.</p> <p>APTES is not readily biodegradable. The observed biodegradation is of the hydrolysis products (ethanol and trisilanols). Bioaccumulation is not anticipated since this material is hydrolytically unstable.</p> <p>In spill conditions, the concentration of the parent silane is very high. The silanols concentration could also be high; however, the silanol rapidly self-condenses to form water insoluble, resinous oligomers and polymers. The molecular weight of the resulting oligomers and polymers is predicted to be over 1000. Anecdotal evidence suggests the molecular weight of the polymers resulting from spills is 5000 -10000. As the parent silane and the resulting silanol are diluted, it is predicted that the polymers resulting from condensation will be of lower molecular weight.</p> <p>At sufficiently low silanol concentrations, low molecular weight oligomers are favored. It is calculated that at 1000 ppm of a related trialkoxysilane, the equilibrium concentration will be 86% silanol monomer and 14% silanol dimer. At still lower concentrations, the silanol will exist as the uncondensed monomer. These polymers will not be bioavailable. However, such materials are likely to cause toxicity in aquatic species due to physical effects (encapsulation, blockage of gills).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): Brachydanio rerio =&gt; 934 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna EC50 (48 h): 331 mg/l</p> <p>Green algae EbC10 (72 h): Scenedesmus subspicatus \u00a038 mg/l (growth rate); ErC10 321 mg/l (suppression of cell growth)</p> <p>Since APTES is sensitive to hydrolysis, which may occur during preparation of the dosing solutions and/or during the testing, the observed toxicity is likely due to the hydrolysis products ethanol and trisilanols.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For ethanol:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 49-716 ppm (detection), 101 ppm (recognition)</p> <p>Eye and respiratory tract irritation do not appear to occur at exposure levels of less than 5000 ppm and the TLV-TWA is thought to provide an adequate margin of safety against such effects.

Subjects exposed to 5000 ppm to 10000 ppm experienced smarting of the eyes and nose and coughing. Symptoms disappeared within minutes. Inhalation also causes local irritating effects to the eyes and upper respiratory tract, headaches, sensation of heat intraocular tension, stupor, fatigue and a need to sleep.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Aliphatic and alicyclic amines are generally well absorbed from the gut. Corrosive action may cause tissue damage throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Detoxification is thought to occur in the liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa with the enzymes, monoamine oxidase and diamine oxidase (histaminase) having a significant role.</p> <p>Exposure can cause necrosis of the oesophagus and stomach with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, circulatory collapse and death.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness.

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in the development of heritable genetic damage, generally on the basis of</p> <p>- appropriate animal studies,</p> <p>- other relevant information</p><p><br /></p> <p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in impaired fertility on the basis of: - clear evidence in animal studies of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which is not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p><p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity, generally on the basis of:</p> <p>- clear results in appropriate animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to ethanol may result in progressive liver damage with fibrosis or may exacerbate liver injury caused by other agents.</p> <p>\u00a0Repeated ingestion of ethanol by pregnant women may adversely affect the central nervous system of the developing foetus, producing effects collectively described as foetal alcohol syndrome.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness.

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There are generally two types of oximes: ketoximes derived from ketones and aldoximes derived form aldehydes. Several ketoximes (p-quinone dioxime, acetoxime and methyl ethyl ketoxime) have elicited carcinogenic effects on chronic exposure. Few substantive studies have been performed with aldoximes. The fact that aldoximes can be metabolised to cyanide via a pathway not applicable to ketoximes distinguishes the type of response which might be anticipated. Dehydration of aldoximes to produce nitriles has been shown to be catalysed in vitro by cytochrome P450; dehydration of ketoximes produces amides, rather than nitriles, via a Beckmann rearrangement but this apparently has no analogue in biological systems.</p> <p>The mechanism and toxicity of oximes to erythrocytes is recognised and might be attributed to hydroxylamine, a product of hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine produces haematologic effects such as methaemoglobinaemia and splenomegaly in mice similar to those observed after exposure to oximes such as butanal oxime. Studies demonstrated the formation of haeme-associated free radicals in erythrocytes exposed to hydroxylamine, leading ultimately to peroxidation of membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes may produce several morphological alterations resulting, for example, in membrane aggregation, deformation or breakage. This may result in the release of hydrolytic enzymes which in turn may degrade functional macromolecules and cause secondary damage. In addition membrane-bound enzyme systems may be disrupted. Levels of hydroxylamine produced as a result of hydrolysis are thought to be too low to produce another sign of hydroxylamine toxicity, namely the formation of Heinz bodies</p> <p>Oximes are not easily oxidised at near neutral conditions and hydrolysis by liver microsomes or S9 is hypothesised (however this conclusion was based on the formation of a ketone rather than hydroxylamine). Another possibility is that oximes are oxidatively metabolised to yield a ketone or aldehyde and some yet to be determined nitrogen-containing species. Cytochrome P450 appears to provide a source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide which catalyses oxidation in the presence of iron. \u00a0At least part of the nitrogen in the oxime is converted to nitric oxide which complexes with haeme to give a nitrosylhaemoglobin complex.</p> <p>Methyl ethyl ketoxime (MEKO) administered to rats by gavage at 25, 75 and 225 mg/kg/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks, produced dose-related decreases in red blood cell counts and haemoglobin and haematocrit values accompanied by a mild to marked reticulocytosis (increased number of young red blood cells).</p> <p>Other effects included a dose-related pattern of spleen, liver and kidney weights. The spleen and liver showed evidence of compensatory red blood cell production suggesting that, in the rat, MEKO induces haemolytic anaemia with complementary erythropoiesis. A no-observed-effect-level was not established but effects at 25 mg/kg were described as minimal.</p> <p>When MEKO was administered to rats at dose levels of 0.5, and 1.0 ml/kg/day, daily for 4 weeks, transient central nervous system depression immediately followed. At 4 weeks dose-related decreases were seen in red blood cell count and haemoglobin. Dose-related increases were evident in spleen weight (from 1.7 to 3.2 fold). It was concluded that 0.1 ml/kg produced only minimal effects. When rats were exposed by inhalation to MEKO vapour for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, mild increases in blood mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, reticulocyte count and red blood cell count were seen at 533 and 714 ppm. Spleen weights were increased and haemosiderosis (deposits of iron) in the spleen were seen at 714 ppm.</p> <p>Haemosiderosis probably resulted from red blood cell haemolysis. Exposures at 60 and 283 ppm produced no observed effects.</p> <p>An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed microscopically in male mice exposed to 375 ppm for 18 months. Both male and female mice exposed at 375 ppm showed enlarged livers but tumours did not occur in females.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Statistically significant alterations in these parameters were not observed in the lower concentrations evaluated (300 and 70 ppm).

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> #CEL TWA: 5 ppm, 75 mg/m3                                      [GE Silicones]#CEL TWA: 10 ppm, 150 mg/m3                                    [Dow Corning]",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Statistically significant alterations in these parameters were not observed in the lower concentrations evaluated (300 and 70 ppm). In a previous range-finding study, rats exposed to vapor concentrations of 700 ppm had decreases in the number of implantation sites and live litter size.

No gross histopathological or significant clinical chemistry effects were observed. An increase in liver metabolizing enzymes, as well as a transient increase in the number of normal cells (hyperplasia) followed by an increase in cell size (hypertrophy) were determined to be the underlying causes of the liver enlargement.

It is\r\nexpected to partition to air by volatilization and to sediments and soil by\r\nadsorption when released to surface water or terrestrial environments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">OMCT is persistent in air, water and sediment, and has a high\r\npotential to accumulate in aquatic organisms. OMCT is also judged to behave\r\nlike a persistent organic pollutant (POP) and have the potential to travel to\r\nthe Arctic. In addition, the experimental toxicity data show that the substance\r\ncan cause long-term toxicity to aquatic organisms at low concentrations in\r\nwater. OMCT meets criteria for persistence and bioaccumulation potential as set\r\nout in the Canadian\u00a0<i>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</i></span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0 Based on the mass flow\r\ntool \u00a0the environmental release of OMCT is mainly to air (~13%). A vapour\r\npressure of 132-157.3 Pa and a Henry's Law constant of 9119 - 60 060 Pa\u00b7m3/mole\r\nas well as a long half-life in air indicates that 100% of the mass fraction released\r\nto air will remain there. Level III results also point out that most (~85%) of\r\nthe mass fraction residing in air from an emission to air will be transported\r\nout of the \"unit world\" (given the long half-life in air) and\r\ntherefore undergo long-range transport.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The results of environmental fate modelling yield a characteristic\r\ntravel distance of approximately 8000 km, strongly suggest the possibility that\r\nlong-range atmospheric transport including transcontinental and\r\nintercontinental movement</span><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Level III fugacity model indicate that OMCT, when released to air,\r\nwill remain in air, where it is expected to be slowly oxidized by the gas-phase\r\nreaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The empirically\r\nderived half-life for OMCT in the gas-phase hydroxyl radical reaction is 10.6\r\ndays. This is based on an experimental reaction rate of 1.01 \u00d7 10-12 cm3/mol.\r\nsec, which may be converted to an estimated half-life of 10.6 days, assuming\r\nfirst-order kinetics, a 12-hour day, and 1.5 \u00d7 10+6 OH/cm3. OMCT is not\r\nexpected to react, or react appreciably, with other photo-oxidative species in\r\nthe atmosphere, such as O3, nor is it likely to degrade via direct photolysis .\r\nTherefore, it is expected that reactions with hydroxyl radicals will be the\r\nmost important fate process in the atmosphere for this substance. The AOPWIN\r\n(2000) model also provides evidence supporting the persistence potential of\r\nthis substance, with a predicted atmospheric oxidation half-life of ~9 days.\r\nThus, the data demonstrate that this substance is persistent in air (half-life\r\n&gt; 2 days).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">When OMCT is released to water it\r\nis expected to adsorb to suspended solids, such as sewage sludge and sediments,\r\nbased on its log Koc value of ~4.5. Results of the Level III simulation for\r\nrelease to water show that approximately 62% will reside in the solid phase\r\n(suspended sediment and bed sediments) and 32% will reside in the aqueous phase\r\n(water column) because the log Koc for the compound is in the moderate sorption\r\nrange. Volatilisation from water surfaces might also be expected based upon the\r\nair-water partition coefficient (Kaw ); however,OMCT adsorptivity to solids\r\nreduces the influence of Kaw and thus reduces the mass fraction expected to\r\npartition to air from volatilisation at 25 C (i.e., ~6%).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The lack of fast biotic and abiotic degradation of OMCT under\r\nexpected environmental conditions will result in a half-life in water of t1/2\r\n&gt; 182 days and in sediment of t1/2 &gt; 365 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Soil:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">When OMCT is released to soil\r\nthrough, for example, applications of sewage sludge on moist agriculture soils,\r\napproximately 9% of the mass fraction will partition to air due to the high Kaw\r\nof OMCT and long half-life in air. However, the majority (~91%) will remain in\r\nsoil associated with solids for the same reasons described for sediment. The\r\nLevel III model may underestimate the mass transferred to air from moist soils,\r\nas it has been experimentally demonstrated this pathway to be a major loss\r\nprocess of cyclic siloxanes from soil. On dry soil, OMCT will quickly hydrolyse\r\nby clay minerals in soil to form dimethylsilanediol as the final breakdown\r\nsubstance. Abiotic reactions such as surface-acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of\r\npolydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), a polymer based on siloxane bonds of\r\ncyclosiloxanes have been demonstrated. Based on the available empirical studies\r\nthat show the potential for rapid clay-catalysed hydrolysis in surface soils,\r\nOMCT is not considered persistent in soil according to the criterion of t1/2\r\n&gt;182 days</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Biodegradation:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">OMCT is\r\nnot likely to be biodegraded in water.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> #CEL TWA: 5 ppm, 60 mg/m3                                [GE Silicones]#CEL TWA: 10 ppm, 120 mg/m3                              [Dow Corning]",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The liver as a target organ for OMCT exposures. The critical effect level for repeated-dose toxicity via inhalation is considered to be 420 mg/m3, based not only on increased liver weights, but also on effects observed in other organs (adrenals, thymus, lungs) in a three-month rat inhalation study. Comparison of the critical effect level for repeated dose effects via inhalation (420 mg/m3) and the conservative upper-bounding exposure estimate via inhalation for OMCT results in an adequate margin of exposure. The critical effect level for repeated-dose toxicity via the oral route is considered to be 100 mg/kg-bw/day, based on decreased serum oestradiol in 7-day mouse studies and decreased body-weights and relative liver weights in foetuses in 8-day rat studies (OMCT administered to pregnant females). Comparison of the critical effect level for repeated dose effects via the oral route (100 mg/kg-bw/day) and the upper-bounding estimate of daily intake of OMCT by the general population results in an adequate margin of exposure.</p> <p>Rodents given 1600 mg/kg/day of the substance over 14 days, by oral gavage, were found to have increased liver weights. An increased number of liver cells were found to be abnormal (hepatocellular hyperplasia) In inhalation studies female rodents exposed to 300 ppm for 90 days (5 day week) were found to increase liver and ovary weights. Examination of liver and ovary cells did not reveal any abnormal pathology. This result could not be reproduced in rabbits or guinea pigs.
