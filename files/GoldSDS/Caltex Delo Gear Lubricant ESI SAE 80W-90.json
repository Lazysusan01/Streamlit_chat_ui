                "Environment": "<p><b>for lubricating oil base stocks:</b></p> <p><b>Vapor Pressure\u00a0</b>Vapor pressures of lubricating base oils are reported to be negligible. In one study, the experimentally measured vapour pressure of a solvent-dewaxed heavy paraffinic distillate base oil was 1.7 x 10exp-4 Pa . Since base oils are mixtures of C15 to C50 paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbon isomers, representative components of those structures were selected to calculate a range of vapor pressures. The estimated vapor pressure values for these selected components of base oils ranged from 4.5 x 10exp-1 Pa to 2 x 10exp-13Pa. Based on Dalton's Law the expected total vapour pressure for base oils would fall well below minimum levels (10exp-5 Pa) of recommended experimental procedures.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Partition Coefficient (log Kow):\u00a0</b>In mixtures such as the base oils, the percent distribution of the hydrocarbon groups (i.e., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and the carbon chain lengths determines in-part the partitioning characteristics of the mixture. Generally, hydrocarbon chains with fewer carbon atoms tend to have lower partition coefficients than those with higher carbon numbers .However, due to their complex composition, unequivocal determination of the log Kow of these hydrocarbon mixtures cannot be made. Rather, partition coefficients of selected C15 chain-length hydrocarbon structures representing paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic constituents in base oil lubricants were modelled . Results showed typical log Kow values from 4.9 to 7.7, which were consistent with values of &gt;4 for lubricating oil basestocks\u00a0</p> <p><b>Water Solubility:</b>When released to water, base oils will float and spread at a rate that is viscosity dependent. While water solubility of base oils is typically very low, individual hydrocarbons exhibit a wide range of solubility depending on molecular weight and degree of unsaturation. Decreasing molecular weight (i.e., carbon number) and increasing levels of unsaturation increases the water solubility of these materials. As noted for partition coefficient, the water solubility of lubricating base oils cannot be determined due to their complex mixture characteristics. Therefore, the water solubility of individual C15 hydrocarbons representing the different groups making up base oils (i.e., linear and branched paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) was modelled. Based on water solubility modelling of those groups, aqueous solubilities are typically much less than 1 ppm. (0.003-0.63 mg/l)</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Chemicals having potential to photolyse have UV/visible absorption maxima in the range of 290 to 800 nm. Some chemicals have absorption maxima significantly below 290 nm and consequently cannot undergo direct photolysis in sunlight (e.g. chemicals such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, saturated alcohols, and saturated acids). Most hydrocarbon constituents of the materials in this category are not expected to photolyse since they do not show absorbance within the 290-800 nm range. However, photodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can occur and may be a significant degradation pathway for these constituents of lubricating base oils. The degree and rate at which PAHs may photodegrade depend upon whether conditions allow penetration of light with sufficient energy to effect a change. For example,polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) compounds bound to sediments may persist due to a lack of sufficient light penetration\u00a0</p> <p>Atmospheric gas-phase reactions can occur between organic chemicals and reactive molecules such as photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen oxides. Atmospheric oxidation as a result of radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but indirect degradation. In general, lubricating base oils have low vapour pressures and volatilisation is not expected to be a significant removal mechanism for the majority of the hydrocarbon components. However, some components (e.g., C15 branched paraffins and naphthenes) appear to have the potential to volatilise Atmospheric half-lives of 0.10 to 0.66 days have been calculated for representative C15 hydrocarbon components of lubricating base oils\u00a0</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Chemicals that have a potential to hydrolyze include alkyl halides, amides, carbamates, carboxylic acid esters and lactones, epoxides, phosphate esters, and sulfonic acid esters. Because lubricating base oils do not contain significant levels of these functional groups, materials in the lubricating base oils category are not subject to hydrolysis\u00a0</p> <p><b>Chemical Transport and Distribution in the Environment :\u00a0</b>Based on the physical-chemical characteristics of component hydrocarbons in lubricating base oils, the lower molecular weight components are expected to have the highest vapour pressures and water solubilities, and the lowest partition coefficients. These factors enhance the potential for widespread distribution in the environment. To gain an understanding of the potential transport and distribution of lubricating base oil components, the EQC (Equilibrium Criterion) model was used to characterize the environmental distribution of different C15 compounds representing different structures found in lube oils (e.g., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics). The modelling found partitioning to soil or air is the ultimate fate of these C15 compounds. Aromatic compounds partition principally to soil. Linear paraffins partition mostly to soil, while branching appears to allow greater distribution to air. Naphthenes distribute to both soil and air, with increasing proportions in soil for components with the greater number of ring structures. Because the modelling does not take into account degradation factors, levels modelled in the atmosphere are likely overstated in light of the tendency for indirect photodegradation to occur.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation: \u00a0T</b>he extent of biodegradation measured for a particular lubricating oil basestock is dependent not only on the procedure used but also on how the sample is presented in the biodegradation test. Lubricant base oils typically are not readily biodegradable in standard 28-day tests. However, since the oils consist primarily of hydrocarbons that are ultimately assimilated by microorganisms, and therefore inherently biodegradable. Twenty-eight biodegradability studies have been reported for a variety of lubricating base oils. Based on the results of ultimate biodegradability tests using modified Sturm and manometric respirometry testing the base oils are expected to be, for the most part, inherently biodegradable. Biodegradation rates found using the modified Sturm procedure ranged from 1.5 to 29%. Results from the manometric respirometry tests on similar materials showed biodegradation rates from 31 to 50%. Biodegradation rates measured in 21-day CEC tests for similar materials ranged from 13 to 79%.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Numerous acute studies covering fish, invertebrates, and algae have been conducted to assess the ecotoxicity of various lubricating base oils. None of these studies have shown evidence of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. Eight, 7-day exposure studies using rainbow trout failed to demonstrate toxicity when tested up to the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Three, 96-hour tests with rainbow trout also failed to show any toxic effects when tested up to 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Similarly, three 96-hour tests with fathead minnows at a maximum test concentration of 100 mg/L water accommodated fractions (WAF) showed no adverse effects. Two species of aquatic invertebrates (Daphnia magna and Gammarus sp.) were exposed to WAF solutions up to 10,000 mg/L for 48 and 96-hours, respectively, with no adverse effects being observed. \u00a0Four-day exposures of the freshwater green alga (Scenedesmus subspicatus) to 500 mg/L WAF solutions failed to show adverse effects on growth rate and algal cell densities in four studies\u00a0</p> <p>Multiple chronic ecotoxicity studies have shown no adverse effects to daphnid survival or reproduction. In 10 of 11 chronic studies, daphnids were exposed for 21 days to WAF preparations of lubricating base oils with no ill effects on survival or reproduction at the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L. One test detected a reduction in reproduction at 1000 mg/L. \u00a0Additional data support findings of no chronic toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fish. No observed effect levels ranged from 550 to 5,000 mg/L when tested as either dispersions or WAFs.\u00a0</p> <p>The data described above are supported by studies on a homologous series of alkanes. The author concluded that the water solubility of carbon chains .C10 is too limited to elicit acute toxicity. This also was shown for alkylbenzene compounds having carbon numbers .C15. Since base oils consist of carbon compounds of C15 to C50, component hydrocarbons that are of acute toxicological concern are, for the most part, absent in these materials. Similarly, due to their low solubility, the alkylated two to three ring polyaromatic components in base oils are not expected to cause acute or chronic toxicity. This lack of toxicity is borne out in the results of the reported studies.\u00a0</p> <p>The effects of crude and refined oils on organisms found in fresh and sea water ha been extensively reviewed.</p> <p>sea water. Where spillages occur the non-mobile species suffer the greatest mortality, whereas fish species can often escape from the affected region. The extent of the initial mortality depends on the chemical nature of the oil, the location, and the physical conditions, particularly the temperature and wind velocity. Most affected freshwater and marine communities recover from the effects of an oil spill within a year. The occurrence of biogenic hydrocarbons in the world's oceans is well recorded. They have the characteristic isoprenoid structure, and measurements made in water columns indicate a background concentration of 1.0 to 10 ul/l. The higher molecular weight materials are dispersed as particles, with the highest concentrations of about 20 ul/l occurring in the top 3 mm layer of water.</p> <p>A wide variation in the response of organisms to oil exposures has been noted. The larvae of fish and crustaceans appear to be most susceptible to the water-soluble fraction of crude oil. Exposures of plankton and algae have indicated that certain species of diatoms and green algae are inhibited, whereas microflagellates are not.</p> <p>For the most part, molluscs and most intertidal worm species appear to be tolerant of oil contamination.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0for mineral oils (excluding metal working fluids), pure, highly and severely refined:</p> <p>Human exposure to oil mist alone has not been demonstrated to cause health effects except at levels above 5 mg/m3 (this applies to particulates sampled by a method that does not collect vapour). It is not advisable to apply this standard to oils containing unknown concentrations and types of additive.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in specific circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material has\u00a0<font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>NOT</b></font>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by ingestion\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p>|Small amounts act as an aperient (mild laxative).",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Mildly-treated solvent refined oils, both naphthenic and paraffinic, induce skin tumours after repeated skin applications in mice. Severe solvent-refining, by contrast, does not induce such tumours.</p> <p>Principal route of exposure is by skin contact; lesser exposures include inhalation of fumes from hot oils, oil mists or droplets. Prolonged contact with mineral oils carries with it the risk of skin conditions such as oil folliculitis, eczematous dermatitis, pigmentation of the face (melanosis) and warts on the sole of the foot (plantar warts). \u00a0With highly refined mineral oils no appreciable systemic effects appear to result through skin absorption.</p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to oil mists frequently elicits respiratory conditions, such as asthma; the provoking agent is probably an additive. High oil mist concentrations may produce lipoid pneumonia although clinical evidence is equivocal. In animals exposed to concentrations of 100 mg/m3 oil mist, for periods of 12 to 26 months, the activity of lung and serum alkaline phosphatase enzyme was raised; 5 mg/m3 oil mist did not produce this response. These enzyme changes are sensitive early indicators of lung damage. Workers exposed to vapours of mineral oil and kerosene for 5 to 35 years showed an increased prevalence of slight basal lung fibrosis.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
