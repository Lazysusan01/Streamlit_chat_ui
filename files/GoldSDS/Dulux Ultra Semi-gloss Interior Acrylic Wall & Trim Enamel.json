The Henry's law constant for ethylene glycol is 1.41 \u00d7 10-3 or 6.08 \u00d7 10-3 Pa.m3/mol, depending on method of calculation, indicating a low capacity for volatilisation from water bodies or soil surfaces.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol adsorbed onto silica gel and irradiated with light (wavelength &gt;290 nm) degraded by 12.1% over 17 h . Photodegradation is not expected, as the molecule should not absorb at these wavelengths; the mechanism of this breakdown is, therefore, unknown. Estimated half-life in the atmosphere for reaction with hydroxyl radicals from various reports \u00a0is 2.1 days , 8-84 h \u00a0or 1 day.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol released to the atmosphere will be degraded by reaction with hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for the compound in this reaction has been estimated at between 0.3 and 3.5 days. No hydrolysis of ethylene glycol is expected in surface waters.</p>\n<p>The compound has little or no capacity to bind to particulates and will be mobile in soil. Soil partition coefficients (log Koc) of 0-0.62 were determined. Migration rates in five soil types were measured \u00a0at between 4 and 27 cm per 12 h</p>\n<p>The low octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow -1.93 to -1.36)and measured bioconcentration factors in a few organisms indicate low capacity for bioaccumulation. Bioconcentration factors of 190 for the green algae\u00a0(Chlorella fusca)\u00a0, up to 0.27 in specific tissues of the crayfish (\u00a0Procambarus\u00a0sp.) , and 10 for the golden orfe\u00a0(Leuciscus idus melanotus)\u00a0confirm low bioaccumulation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Ethylene glycol is readily biodegradable in standard tests using sewage sludge. Many studies show biodegradation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Some studies suggest a lag phase before degradation, but many do not. Degradation occurs in both adapted and unadapted sludges. Rapid degradation has been reported in surface waters (less in salt water than in fresh water), groundwater, and soil inocula. Several strains of microorganisms capable of utilising ethylene glycol as a carbon source have been identified.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol has been identified as a metabolite of the growth regulator ethylene in a number of higher plants and as naturally occurring in the edible fungus\u00a0Tricholoma matsutake</p>\n<p><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong></p>\n<p>Fish LC50 (96 h):118-550 mg/L</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol has generally low toxicity to aquatic organisms. Toxic thresholds for microorganisms are above 1000 mg/litre. EC50s for growth in microalgae are 6500 mg/litre or higher. Acute toxicity tests with aquatic invertebrates where a value could be determined show LC50s above 20 000 mg/litre, and those with fish show LC50s above 17 800 mg/litre. An amphibian test showed an LC50 for tadpoles at 17 000 mg/litre. A no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for chronic tests on daphnids of 8590 mg/litre (for reproductive end-points) has been reported. A NOEC following short-term exposure of fish has been reported at 15 380 mg/litre for growth. Tests using deicer containing ethylene glycol showed greater toxicity to aquatic organisms than observed with the pure compound, indicating other toxic components of the formulations. Laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have demonstrated toxic effects and death. Field studies in the vicinity of an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity. These effects cannot definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol. Terrestrial organisms are much less likely to be exposed to ethylene glycol and generally show low sensitivity to the compound. Concentrations above 100 000 mg/litre were needed to produce toxic effects on yeasts and fungi from soil. Very high concentrations and soaking of seeds produced inhibition of germination in some experiments; these are not considered of environmental significance. A no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for orally dosed ducks at 1221 mg/kg body weight and reported lethal doses for poultry at around 8000 mg/kg body weight indicate low toxicity to birds.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce severe damage to the health of the individual. Relatively small amounts absorbed through the lungs may prove fatal.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Strong evidence exists that exposure to the material may produce very serious irreversible damage (other than carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and teratogenesis) following a single exposure by swallowing.</p> <p>The toxic effects of glycols (dihydric alcohols), following ingestion are similar to those of alcohol, with depression of the central nervous system (CNS), nausea, vomiting and degenerative changes in liver and kidney.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>for ethylene glycol:</p> <p>Ingestion symptoms include respiratory failure, central nervous depression, cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary oedema, acute kidney failure, and even brain damage. Ingestion of 100 ml has caused death. (ChemInfo)</p> <p>Toxicity of ethylene glycol to human (KB) cell cultures has been reported as less than that of ethanol. (NIOSHTIC)</p> <p>Ethylene glycol produces a three-stage response with the severity of each stage dependent on the amount of ingestion. Hepatic damage is usually minimal. Central nervous system depression characterise the first 12 hours post ingestion.</p> <p>Transient exhilaration occurs without the odour of ethanol.</p> <p>Gastrointestinal complaints include nausea and vomiting. Acidosis, coma, convulsions and myoclonic jerks may also be evident. The optic fundus is usually normal although the presence of papilloedema may confuse the presentation with that produced by methanol. Nystagmus and opthalmoplegias may appear.</p> <p>Cardiopulmonary effects are seen 12-24 hours post-ingestion and are characterised by tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypertension. Congestive heart failure and circulatory collapse may occur in severe intoxications.</p> <p>Renal effects are seen 24-72 hours post-ingestion and are characterised by oliguria, flank pain, acute tubular necrosis, renal failure, and rarely, bone marrow arrest. Renal damage may be permanent.</p> <p>Toxic effects of ethylene glycol are similar to those produced by ethanol but ethylene glycol produces toxic metabolites. Metabolic acidosis and anion gap result primarily from glycolic acid formation and some lactic</p> <p>acid formation. The citric acid cycle is inhibited as a result of reduced NAD/NADH ratios and to a limited extent, the formation of oxalic acid, and to metabolic acidosis. Oxalate formation produces myocardial depression and acute tubular necrosis. Glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid may contribute to CNS depression and may also produce renal toxicity by producing renal oedema. Hypocalcaemia may result from chelation by oxalate. Oxalic acid, glycoxalic acid, glycoaldehyde and formic acid appear to form to only a limited degree during intoxication.</p> <p>Oral administration to pregnant mice and rats produced birth defects amongst the off-spring.</p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>There is some evidence to provide a presumption that human exposure to the material may result in impaired fertility on the basis of: \u00a0some evidence in animal studies of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which is not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Human volunteers exposed to ethylene glycol, 20 to 22 hours/day at mean daily concentrations ranging form 1.4 to 27 ppm for about 4 weeks complained of throat irritation, mild headache and low backache. Complaints became marked when the concentration in the exposure chamber was raised above 56 mg/m3 for part of the day. The most common complaint was irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Concentrations above 80 ppm were intolerable with a burning sensation along the trachea and a burning cough. Excessively exposed workers have reported drowsiness.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Nevertheless, adverse systemic effects have been produced following exposure of animals by at least one other route and good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Body content of titanium is presumed to be high (because titanium occupies fourth place in occurrence in the earth's surface) and is reported to be general in all organs of the body. Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). A further as yet unexplored mechanism may involve substitution by titanium for several metals (such as vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc) which perform essential biologic functions; all have a similar atomic radius</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

It differs greatly from classical silicosis both clinically and pathologically. The disease is rapidly progressive with diffuse pulmonary involvement developing only months after the initial exposure and causing deaths within 1 to 2 years. It is often complicated by an associated tuberculosis. The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage. This causes the macrophage to be digested by its own enzymes and after lysis the free silica is released to be ingested by other macrophages thus continuing initiate collagen formation in the lung tissue producing the characteristic nodule found in classical (chronic) silicosis.</p>",

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Estimations based on a \"highly\" dispersed\r\npolymer population suggest that a polymer of approximate molecular weight 5000\r\ncould contain no more than one reactive group of high concern for it to be\r\nregulated as a polymer of low concern (a so-called PLC) Polymers with a\r\nmolecular weight above 10000 are generally considered to be PLCs because these\r\nare not expected to be absorbed by biological systems. The choice of 10000 as a\r\ncut-off value is thought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as\r\nreasonable in light of limited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which\r\neffects are seen, and extrapolation from animals to humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ingredients in the Acrylates\r\nCopolymer group all contain the monomers acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or\r\none of their salts or esters. These ingredients are considered similar in that\r\nthey are uniformly produced in chemical reactions that leave very little\r\nresidual monomer. Although residual acrylic acid may be as high as 1500 ppm,\r\ntypical levels are 10 to 1000 ppm. There is sufficient odor if residual\r\nmonomers are present to cause producers to keep levels as low as possible.\r\nThese ingredients function in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair\r\nfixatives, suspending agents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion\r\nstabilizers. Concentrations may be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film\r\nformer, or fixative; or as low as 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent,\r\nsuspending agent, or emulsion stabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit\r\nlittle toxicity. In rabbits and guinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce\r\nirritation, but no evidence of sensitization was found. The principle concern\r\nregarding the use of these polymer ingredients is the presence of toxic\r\nresidual monomers. In particular, although 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ngenotoxic, it was carcinogenic when applied at a concentration of 21% to the\r\nskin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations (2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high\r\nconcentrations (43%) were not carcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ncarcinogenic in studies using NMRI mice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis\r\nwas seen or not, there was evidence of severe dermal irritation in these\r\n2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another concern regarding residual monomers was\r\ninhalation toxicity. Although the acrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant,\r\nexposure to the monomer from use of these polymers in cosmetic formulations\r\nwould always be less than the established occupational exposure limits for\r\nnasal irritation. Although there appears to be a huge variation in the mix of\r\nmonomers used in the synthesis of these polymers, they are similar in that the\r\npolymers, except for dermal irritation, are not significantly toxic, and\r\nresidual monomer levels are kept as low as possible. Although the monomers may\r\nbe toxic, the levels that would be found in cosmetic formulations are not\r\nconsidered to present a safety risk. Accordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are\r\nconsidered safe for use in cosmetic formulations when formulated to avoid\r\nirritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p>",

Lactic acidosis may result.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Propylene glycol is though, by some, to be a sensitising principal following the regular use of topical creams by eczema patients. A study of 866 persons using a formulation containing propylene glycol in a patch test indicated that propylene glycol caused primary irritation in 16% of exposed individuals probably caused by dehydration. Undiluted propylene glycol was tested on 1556 persons in a 24 hour patch test. 12.5% showed reactions which were largely toxic (70%) or allergic in nature (30%). Reaction responses reached their maximum on the second day or later. Reactions were seasonal in nature ranging from 17.8% in winter to 9.2% in other seasons. In a patch-test using 25 standard allergens conducted on 500 individuals, propylene glycol ranked fourth in sensitising response. 84 subjects were patch tested using 100% propylene glycol. as well as 2% and 5% in water. With undiluted material, 15% demonstrated a reaction, with 40% of the reactions being allergic in nature and 60% being irritant. In dilute solutions 5 of 248 subjects exhibited a reaction.</p> <p>Undiluted propylene glycol tested on the skin of man produced no irritation under open conditions but when applied under occlusive conditions, for 2 weeks, it produced severe erythema, oedema and vesicles, probably due to sweat retention and weak primary irritation.</p> <p>Predictive contact skin sensitisation tests indicate that propylene glycol is an intermediate grade sensitiser with an index of 1% of tested subjects.</p> <p>\u00a0Groups of cats fed 5 gm/kg/day of propylene glycol for 14 weeks showed a significant dose-related increase in red blood cell Heinz body formation without any marked signs of haemolytic anaemia. The no-effect-level for cats without formation of Heinz bodies is 100-500 ml/kg. There is no evidence of anaemia or degenerative change. Groups of rats dosed orally with 0.5 or 10 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks had lowered food intake but no adverse effects on body weights. Erythrocytes were more fragile. Heinz bodies were not apparent.</p>",

Acrylic resin is considered extremely weatherproof. This makes it ideal for outdoor applications. In solid form acrylic resin can even last for decades.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Estimations based on a \"highly\" dispersed\r\npolymer population suggest that a polymer of approximate molecular weight 5000\r\ncould contain no more than one reactive group of high concern for it to be\r\nregulated as a polymer of low concern (a so-called PLC) Polymers with a\r\nmolecular weight above 10000 are generally considered to be PLCs because these\r\nare not expected to be absorbed by biological systems. The choice of 10000 as a\r\ncut-off value is thought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as\r\nreasonable in light of limited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which\r\neffects are seen, and extrapolation from animals to humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ingredients in the Acrylates\r\nCopolymer group all contain the monomers acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or\r\none of their salts or esters. These ingredients are considered similar in that\r\nthey are uniformly produced in chemical reactions that leave very little\r\nresidual monomer. Although residual acrylic acid may be as high as 1500 ppm,\r\ntypical levels are 10 to 1000 ppm. There is sufficient odor if residual\r\nmonomers are present to cause producers to keep levels as low as possible.\r\nThese ingredients function in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair\r\nfixatives, suspending agents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion\r\nstabilizers. Concentrations may be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film\r\nformer, or fixative; or as low as 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent,\r\nsuspending agent, or emulsion stabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit\r\nlittle toxicity. In rabbits and guinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce\r\nirritation, but no evidence of sensitization was found. The principle concern\r\nregarding the use of these polymer ingredients is the presence of toxic\r\nresidual monomers. In particular, although 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ngenotoxic, it was carcinogenic when applied at a concentration of 21% to the\r\nskin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations (2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high\r\nconcentrations (43%) were not carcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ncarcinogenic in studies using NMRI mice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis\r\nwas seen or not, there was evidence of severe dermal irritation in these\r\n2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another concern regarding residual monomers was\r\ninhalation toxicity. Although the acrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant,\r\nexposure to the monomer from use of these polymers in cosmetic formulations\r\nwould always be less than the established occupational exposure limits for\r\nnasal irritation. Although there appears to be a huge variation in the mix of\r\nmonomers used in the synthesis of these polymers, they are similar in that the\r\npolymers, except for dermal irritation, are not significantly toxic, and\r\nresidual monomer levels are kept as low as possible. Although the monomers may\r\nbe toxic, the levels that would be found in cosmetic formulations are not\r\nconsidered to present a safety risk. Accordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are\r\nconsidered safe for use in cosmetic formulations when formulated to avoid\r\nirritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>",
