Triethylene- and tetraethylene- glycol ethers represent typical members of the category. All category members can be represented by the generic molecular formula:</p> <p>HO(CH2CH2O)nR - n=2,3,4,5,6 and higher ethylene units and R=alkyl(methyl, ethyl, butyl etc.)</p> <p>All are high boiling liquids of low volatility and high water solubility. Higher molecular weight species and surrogates may be solids at ambient temperatures.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Estimated photodegradation hydroxyl radical rate constants \u00a0for category members are in close agreement. Photodegradation half-lives of triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE), tetraethylene glycol methyl ether (TetraME), and tetraethylene glycol butyl ether (TetraBE) (estimated using the EPIWIN/AOP model) have atmospheric photodegradation half-lives of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 hours respectively.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Ether groups are generally stable to water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. The ether function is hydrolysed by heating in the presence of halogen acids, particularly hydrogen iodide.</p> <p><b>Volatilisation</b>: The category members are highly soluble to miscible in water, possess high boiling points (in excess of 250 C) and low vapour pressures. The estimated Henry's Law Constants, fall in the narrow range of 3.54 E-14 to 3.67 E-13 m3* atm/mol at 25 C point to a limited volatilisation potential.</p> <p><b>Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The ethers in this category possess physical properties that suggest that once they enter the aqueous compartment, they tend to remain dissolved in water. Soil/sediment partition coefficients (Koc) of 10 have been estimated for TGBE, TetraME and TetraBE . These results suggest that the category members have uniformly high soil mobility. Thus, these products can leach from soil deposits to groundwater, but can also be transported to environments where aerobic biodegradation can take place.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>When released to water, some studies show that biodegradation of category members is reasonably rapid . OECD guideline studies indicate biodegradability (&gt; 90%) for TGBE (ready or inherent) and TetraME (inherent). However,another comparative biodegradation study of triethylene glycol methyl ether (TGME), triethylene glycol ethyl ether (TGEE) and triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE) indicate slower rates of biodegradation (from 47-71%). Altogether, the data suggest that different study methodologies provide variable results for the tri- and tetraethylene glycol ethers. No category members or surrogates that were tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>The category members have a limited potential to bioaccumulate (based on log Kow's ranging from -1.73 to +0.51, 20 C), and predicted bioconcentration factors, log BCF = ca. 0.50</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The data suggest that trimethyl, -ethyl and -butyl ethers and are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.</p> <p>The LC50 values for fish, Daphnia, and algae are 2,400 mg/l, \u00a02,210 mg/l, and &gt; 500 mg/l, respectively. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers. Due to the structural and physical similarities of TetraME and TetraBE with the other glycol ethers in the category, it is likely that these glycol ethers are also of low toxicity to aquatic species</p> <p>The toxicity of TGBE, TetraME, TGEE and TGME to bacteria also has been tested. In sewer microorganisms exposed to TGBE, TGEE and TGME for 16 hours, the LD50 values were &gt; 5,000, &gt;10,000 and &gt;5,000 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of TetraME required to cause inhibition of respiration of activated sludge is reportedly &gt; 12,500 mg/kg for 3 hours\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for alcohol ethoxylates</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alcohol (alkyl) ethoxylates (AEs) are generally biodegradable and do not persist for any substantial period in the environment. They are not usually present a concentrations which might produce problems. Contamination of natural waters, however, should be avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The biodegradability of the alcohol ethoxylates (AE) is relatively unaffected by the alkyl carbon chain length and the number of EO units. The linear AE are normally easily degraded under aerobic conditions. Only small differences are seen in the time needed for ultimate degradation of linear AE with different alkyl chain lengths. AE with a typical alkyl chain (e.g., C12 to C15) will normally reach more than 60% degradation in standardized tests for \"ready\" biodegradability. The rate of biodegradation may however be determined by the length of the ethylene oxide (EO) chain. Longer EO chains decrease the bioavailability of the AE (to microorganism) due to increased hydrophilicity and molecular size, which limits the transport of the molecule through the cell wall. The biodegradation of branched AE tends to be slower than biodegradation of linear AE. The biodegradability of AE depends on degree and structure of the branching. The general trend is that the biodegradation decreases considerably with an increasing branching of the carbon chain. The biodegradability of alcohol alkoxylates (AA), similarly, generally decreases with an increasing number of PO units. AA containing 6 PO units did not pass the level required for ready biodegradability whereas the same alcohol containing 2 PO units attained 83% ThOD in the closed bottle test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mineralization observed in experiments with 14C-labelled surfactants suggests that almost complete degradation of linear AE may be expected in anaerobic digesters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available information suggests that alcohol ethoxylates can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic organisms. These effects vary by carbon chain length. Typical alcohol ethoxylate surfactant chain length ranges from 9 to 18 carbons and 3 to 8 ethoxylate groups. Toxicity generally declines as the number of ethoxylates increases</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A summary of chronic toxicity data from 60 studies conducted between 1977 and 2004 on fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plant and algae species states that alcohol ethoxylates\u2019 effects on aquatic species include reduced growth rates, impaired reproduction, and reduced survival of neonates, as well as acute mortality. Alcohol ethoxylates may cause diminished growth rates and reduced cell counts in algae species at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg/L .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The concentrations at which alcohol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality in aquatic species are similar to the concentrations at which nonylphenol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality. However, alcohol ethoxylates degrade more quickly in the aquatic environment to relatively non-toxic compounds, whereas nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation typically yields nonylphenol, which is toxic as well as persistent in the aquatic environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Algae constitute the group of aquatic organisms which appears to be the most sensitive to AE. The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. For the linear AE, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length of C13 ) and decreasing EO chain length. The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to invertebrates varies with EC50 values from 0.1 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.5 mg/l to 50 mg/l for the branched types. The toxicity is species specific and may vary between 0.29 mg/l to 270 mg/l for the same linear AE The most commonly used invertebrates for testing are\u00a0Daphnia magna\u00a0and\u00a0Daphnia pulex, and they are also among the most sensitive invertebrates to AE. Apparently, the toxicity of AE to invertebrates was not related to hydrophobicity as it is the case for algae. Some AE are very toxic to invertebrates, i.e., linear AE of C12-15 EO1-8 and branched AE with a low degree of branching, i.e. &lt; 10-25%. Branching of the alkyl chain reduces the toxicity of AE to invertebrates as also observed for algae.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to fish varies with LC50 values from 0.4 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.25 mg/l to 40 mg/l for the branched AE. For linear AE the toxicity increases with decreasing EO units. AE containing 7-11 EO groups are considered to be very toxic to fish (EC/LC50: 1 mg/l).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special interest are the aryl alcohol ethoxylates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A EU Risk Assessment Report (RAR) concluded that octyl- and nonyl- phenol ethoxylates are\u00a0not readily biodegradable but are inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As a group, these materials are generally toxic to fish with LC50s ranging, typically, between 1-6 mg/l.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special concern are the following families which are classified as\u00a0\"Environmentally Hazardous Substances\"\u00a0(Dangerous Goods Class 9) by either or both the ADR (Accord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Merchandises Dangerous par Route) and the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C 6-17 (secondary) with 3-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C12-15 with 1-3 moles of ethoxylation (1-6 moles of ethoxylation IMDG)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C13-15 with 1-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">New aquatic data suggests that alcohols C 8-9 branched with 3-10 moles of ethoxylation alcohols C 8-9 branched with &gt; 10 moles of ethoxylation should also be classified as\u00a0'harmful to the environment\".</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These alcohols may also be found linked to aromatic structures (in nonylphenol ethoxylates for example).

Degradation of APEs in wastewater\r\ntreatment plants or in the environment generates more persistent shorter-chain\r\nAPEs and alkylphenols (APs) such as nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and AP\r\nmono- to triethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2 and NPE3). There is concern that APE\r\nmetabolites (NP, OP, NPE1-3) can mimic natural hormones and that the levels\r\npresent in the environment may be sufficient to disrupt endocrine function in\r\nwildlife and humans. The physicochemical properties of the APE metabolites (NP,\r\nNPE1-4, OP, OPE1-4), in particular the high Kow values, indicate that they will\r\npartition effectively into sediments following discharge from STPs. The aqueous\r\nsolubility data for the APE metabolites indicate that the concentration in\r\nwater combined with the high partition coefficients will provide a significant\r\nreservoir (load) in various environmental compartments. Data from studies\r\nconducted in many regions across the world have shown significant levels in\r\nsamples of every environmental compartment examined. In the US, levels of NP in\r\nair ranged from 0.01 to 81 ng/m3, with seasonal trends observed. Concentrations\r\nof APE metabolites in treated wastewater effluents in the US ranged from &lt;\r\n0.1 to 369 ug/l, in Spain they were between 6 and 343 ug/l and concentrations\r\nup to 330 ug/l were found in the UK. Levels in sediments reflected the high\r\npartition coefficients with concentrations reported ranging from &lt; 0.1 to\r\n13,700 ug/kg for sediments in the US. Fish in the UK were found to contain up\r\nto 0.8 ug/kg NP in muscle tissue. APEs degraded faster in the water column than\r\nin sediment. Aerobic conditions facilitate easier further biotransformation of\r\nAPE metabolites than anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenols are susceptible to photochemical degradation. Using\r\nnatural, filtered, lake water it was found that nonylphenol had a half-life of\r\napproximately 10-15 h under continuous, noon, summer sun in the surface water\r\nlayer, with a rate approximately 1.5 times slower at depths 20-25 cm.\r\nPhotolysis was much slower with ethoxylated nonylphenol, and so it is unlikely\r\nto be a significant event in removal of the ethoxylates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols released to the\r\natmosphere will exist in the vapour phase and is thought to be degraded by\r\nreaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, with a calculated\r\nhalf-life, for nonylphenol, of 0.3 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Abiotic degradation of\r\nalkylphenol is negligible.

During\r\ndegradation ethylene oxide units are cleaved off the ethylene oxide chain until\r\nonly short-chain alkylphenol ethoxylates remain, typically mono- and diethylene\r\noxides. Oxidation of these oligomers creates the corresponding carboxylic acids.\r\nThis leaves several degradation products: short-chain ethoxylates, their\r\ncarboxylic acids, and alkylphenols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Alkylphenols are not\r\nreadily biodegradable. Several mechanisms of microbial aromatic ring\r\ndegradation have been reported, the most common being formation of catechol\r\nfrom phenol, followed by ring scission between or adjacent to the two hydroxyl\r\ngroups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The full breakdown pathway for APES has not yet been determined,\r\nand all studies have so far focused on identification of intermediates in\r\nbacterial culture media, rather than studying cell-free systems or purified\r\nenzymes. It is, however, likely that microbial metabolism usually starts by an\r\nattack on the ethoxylate chain, rather than on the ring or the hydrophobic\r\nchain. The ethoxylate groups are progressively removed, either by ether\r\ncleavage, or by terminal alcohol oxidation followed by cleavage of the\r\nresulting carboxylic acid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation of APEs produces less biodegradable products:\r\nalkylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylates, alkylphenoxy acetic and\r\nalkylphenoxypolyethoxy acetic acids, and alkylphenols. These metabolites\r\nfrequently persist through sewage treatment and in rivers. Anaerobic conditions\r\ngenerally lead to the accumulation of alkylphenols. The rate of biodegradation\r\nseems to decrease with increasing length of the ethylene oxide chain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Metabolites of APES\r\naccumulate in organisms, with bioconcentration factors varying from ten to\r\nseveral thousand, depending on species, metabolite and organ.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The metabolites of APES are generally more toxic than the original\r\ncompounds. APES have LC50s above about 1.5 mg/l, whereas alkylphenols,such as\r\nnonylphenol, have LC50s are generally around 0.1 mg/l.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Oestrogenic activity:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The role\r\nof alkyl chain length and branching, substituent position, number of alkylated\r\ngroups, and the requirement of a phenolic ring structure was assessed in fish.\r\nThe results showed that most alkylphenols were oestrogenic, although with 3-300\r\nthousand times lower potency than the endogenous estrogen 17beta-estradiol.\r\nMono-substituted tertiary alkylphenols with moderate (C4-C5) and long alkyl\r\nchain length (C8-C9) in the para position exhibited the highest oestrogenic\r\npotency. Substitution with multiple alkyl groups, presence of substituents in\r\nthe ortho- and meta-position and lack of a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring\r\nreduced the oestrogenic activity, although several oestrogenic alkylated\r\nnon-phenolics were identified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Human exposure:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols were first\r\nfound to be oestrogenic (oestrogen-mimicking) in the 1930s, but more recent\r\nresearch has highlighted the implications of these effects. The growth of\r\ncultured human breast cancer cells is affected by nonylphenol at concentrations\r\nas low as 1 uM (220 ug/ l) or concentrations of octylphenol as low as 0.1 uM\r\n(20 ug/1). Oestrogenic effects have also been shown on rainbow trout\r\nhepatocytes, chicken embryo fibroblasts and a mouse oestrogen receptor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The insecticide chlordecone (Kepone) shows similar behaviour to\r\nalkylphenols, accumulating in liver and adipose tissue, and eliciting\r\noestrogenic activity. Workers exposed to this insecticide can suffer\r\nreproductive effects such as low sperm counts and sterility. In addition, the\r\noestrogenic effects of chlordecone on MCF7 cells occur at similar concentrations\r\nto those of alkylphenols, suggesting that alkylphenols will be a similar health\r\nhazard if target cells are exposed to uM levels of these compounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">By comparing environmental concentrations, bioconcentration\r\nfactors and\u00a0<i>in vitro\u00a0</i>oestrogenic effect levels, current\r\nenvironmental levels of alkylphenolic compounds are probably high enough to\r\naffect the hormonal control systems of some organisms.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for human fertility, on the basis that similar materials provide some evidence of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p> <p>The alkyl phenolics (which may occur as breakdown products of some polyethoxylated surfactants) have been implicated in a phenomenon which has apparently occurred since the mid 1960s, namely lower sperm counts and reduced fertility in males. Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

MacKay\r\nLevel III fugacity modeling predicts that TRIS AMINO and the surrogate\r\nsubstances will tend to partition predominately to water</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There is also a low potential to bioaccumulate in aquatic\r\norganisms based on low log Kow values. The high water solubility and negligible\r\nvapor pressure of all three substances support the low estimated Henry\u2019s Law\r\nConstants (4.54x10-8 and 6.48x10-10 Pa m3/mol for TRIS AMINO and AMP,\r\nrespectively, and 8.67 x10-13 atm-m3/mole for AMPD)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental transport:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nfugacity mass amount (partitioning) values estimated for TRIS AMINO indicate\r\nthat distribution into the air would be negligible (&lt;0.1%), as would be\r\nexpected for primary amino alcohols compounds with low volatility and high\r\nsolubility in water. Likewise, the distribution to sediment was estimated to be\r\n&lt;0.1%. The calculated mass amounts in the soil environmental compartment was\r\n&lt;0.1%; the predicted mass amounts distributed to water was 100.0%, a high\r\nlevel that is consistent with the known high water solubility of members of\r\nthis category</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Photodegradation<i>:</i></span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0TRIS\r\nAMINO does not absorb light &gt;290 nm, and therefore direct photolysis is not\r\npossible. Indirect photolysis (hydroxyl radicals) is possible, however.\r\nModeling has shown that the half-life of TRIS AMINO in the atmosphere is\r\napproximately 3.8 hours</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrolysis\u00a0<i>:\u00a0</i></span></b><span style=\"color:black\">TRIS\r\nAMINO does not possess molecular structures that contain functional groups\r\nsubject to hydrolysis under neutral ambient conditions (Reaction Mechanisms in\r\nEnvironmental Organic Chemistry, 1994). It is commercially available as an\r\naqueous mixture, further documenting high stability in water, and is reported\r\nstable for several years &lt;200 C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradability:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">A\r\nbiodegradation study, OECD 301D, for TRIS AMINO indicates that it is not\r\nreadily biodegradable . There is evidence based on studies with\r\nstructurally-related compounds to suggest that TRIS AMINO would biodegrade\r\nunder favourable conditions. There is an OECD 302C study on AMPD which showed\r\n96.7% biodegradation after 22 days. \u00a0This \u00a0family should therefore be\r\nconsidered as \"inherently biodegradable\", which indicates that it\r\nwould not persist indefinitely in the environment and that it would exhibit\r\nsimilar biodegradation potential based on structure-biodegradability\r\nrelationships measured for similar compounds</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The data on fish, aquatic invertebrate, and algal toxicity, in\r\naddition to the use of TRIS AMINO as a buffer for live fish transport, indicate\r\na pattern of low toxicity for this chemical and the surrogate substances.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Repeated inhalation may aggravate asthma and inflammatory or fibrotic pulmonary disease.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Results of repeated exposure tests with diethanolamine (DEA) in laboratory animals include anaemia (rats) and effects on the kidneys (rats and mice) and liver (mice). DEA produces nervous system injury in dogs and rats. Heart and salivary gland lesions have also been seen in mice treated cutaneously with DEA and in mice receiving DEA in drinking water. Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids. They are excreted predominantly unchanged with a half-life of approximately one week. In the absence of sodium nitrite, no conversion to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines was observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Diethanolamine competitively inhibits the cellular uptake of choline, in vitro, and hepatic changes in choline homeostasis, consistent with choline deficiency, are observed in vivo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Many amines are potent skin and respiratory sensitisers and certain individuals especially those described as \"atopic\" (i.e. those predisposed to asthma and other allergic responses) may show allergic reactions when chronically exposed to alkanolamines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In a study with coconut diethanolamide, the National Toxicology Program (Technical Report Series 479), showed clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic and renal tubule neoplasms and in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis in males and females, ulcer in males, and parakeratosis and inflammation in females at the site of application and of follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland of males and females, were chemical related.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.
