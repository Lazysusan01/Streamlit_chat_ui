Within each subcategory the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter ion may also influence the physico-chemical behaviour of these chemicals, the chemical reactivity and classification for the purpose of this assessment is not expected to be affected by the difference in counter ion.</p> <p>As ionic substances, all members of this category have extremely low vapor pressures. Calculated values are in the ranges 10-11 to 10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkyl sulfates), 4.3.10-11 to 9.10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkane sulfonates), 2.1.10-13 to 6.9.10-15 hPa (C14-18 alkene sulfonates) and 3.3.10-17 to 5.8.10-19 hPa (C14-18 hydroxy alkane sulfonates). Therefore, they decompose before reaching their theoretical boiling points.</p> <p>Measured water solubilities are available only for alkyl sulfates; they are in the range 196 000 mg/l (C12) to 300 mg/l (C16) and by factors of 50 to 300 higher than calculated values (C12: 617 mg/l, C16: 5 mg/l).</p> <p>As surfactants have a tendency to concentrate at hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundaries rather than to equilibrate between phases log Kow is not a good descriptor of surfactant hydrophobicity and only of limited predictive value for the partitioning of these compounds in the environment.</p> <p>All calculated physico-chemical properties of surfactants should be treated with caution, because the estimation models do not take into account surfactant properties. In addition, the results are doubtful for ionic substances.</p> <p>Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties the target compartment for the substances of this category is the hydrosphere. Based on the ionic structure partitioning into the atmosphere can be excluded. In water, the compounds are stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions.</p> <p>Taking into account the low BCF factors (&lt;73) that were determined for (up to) C16-alkyl sulfates, any significant bioaccumulation is not expected.</p> <p>Soil sorption increases with chain length. Strong sorption on soils would be expected for chain length C14 upwards. Sediment concentrations were between 0.0035 and 0.021 mg/kg dw indicating that accumulation in sediments is low. Under certain conditions of reduced moisture in soil, i.e. in arid or semi-arid regions, accumulation in soil cannot be excluded.</p> <p>The substances of this category are readily biodegradable. Significant biodegradation of alkyl sulfates in the raw sewage, i.e. in the sewer system before reaching the (waste-water treatment plant (WWTPs) is very likely. The substances of this category are quantitatively removed in WWTPs, mainly by biodegradation. Because of the anaerobic degradation of alkyl sulfates in sewage sludge, exposure of agricultural soils due to application of sludge as fertiliser is not expected. However, for alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates this exposure pathway cannot be excluded due to their recalcitrant or limited anaerobic degradability.</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions is anticipated to follow the same pathway as for the aerobic degradation.</p> <p>Primary and secondary AS generally undergo complete primary biodegradation within a few days followed by a rapid ultimate biodegradation. Branched AS are also degraded quite rapidly, but multiple branchings of the alkyl chain considerably reduce the rate and extent of primary biodegradation. There are numerous studies confirming the aerobic biodegradability of AS, and linear primary AS exceeds all other anionic surfactants in the rate of primary and ultimate biodegradation. Also secondary AS are normally readily biodegradable as, e.g., the oxygen uptake from biodegradation of a linear secondary C10-13 AS corresponded to 77% ThOD in 22 days. Some highly branched AS being poorly primary biodegradable may also resist ultimate biodegradation.</p> <p>Both linear and 2-alkyl-branched primary AS are degraded to a high extent under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>AS are generally considered to have a low potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:\u00a0</b>Alkane sulfonate anionics (SAS) undergo rapid primary biodegradation with Methylene Blue Active Substance (MBAS) removal higher than 90% within a few days. Removal of 96% were seen in the OECD screening test for primary biodegradation. In activated sludge simulation tests, 96% of C10-18 SAS was removed, while the parent C13-18 SAS was removed by 83-96%.</p> <p>Alkyl sulfonates are not degraded under anoxic conditions</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates:\u00a0</b>alpha-Olefine sulfonates (AOS) AOS undergo rapid primary biodegradability with methylene blue active substances ( MBAS) removal between 95 and 100% in 2 to 8 days in river water and inoculated media. The ultimate biodegradability of AOS exceeds the pass requirements in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability. \u00a0report 85% DOC removal in the modified OECD screening test, 85% ThOD in the closed bottle test, and 65-80% ThCO2 in the Sturm test. In activated sludge simulation tests, AOS was removed by 100% MBAS and 88% DOC. The alkene sulfonates and hydroxyalkane sulfonates in commercial AOS are both ultimately biodegraded as approximately 84% ThCO2 was obtained during degradation of C14, C16, and C18 within 27 days, whereas the corresponding 3-hydroxyalkane sulfonates were degraded by approximately 86% under the same conditions.</p> <p>AOS are not readily degradable under anaerobic conditions Reports indicate a range of 31% to 43% MBAS removal under anoxic conditions indicating primary biodegradation</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity is influenced by a number of parameters, the length of the alkyl chain being most important. The pH and temperature of water bodies can affect the EC/LC50 values for compounds that contain ammonium ions.</p> <p>The most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates were invertebrates, followed by fish. Algae proved to be less sensitive. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (NOEC = 0.045 mg/l).</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow - fry 10.2 mg/l; juvenile 17 mg/l; adult 22.5 mg/l; rainbow trout 4.6 mg/l (static)</p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of AS seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length. This has been shown for daphnids and for some fish species. An overall comparison of the acute toxicity between the primary and secondary AS shows only minor differences in the toxicity, although only a few studies for comparison are available.</p> <p>The available data describing the toxicity of AS towards algae indicate that the lowest EC50 values range between 1 and 10 mg/l for C12 AS</p> <p>The toxicity of AS towards invertebrates has mainly been examined in tests with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity of AS to Daphnia magna increased with increasing alkyl chain length. It has been shown that during degradation of C12 AS, the toxicity first increased to a maximum after 30 hours and then fell to almost a negligible value. The increase in toxicity was explained by the formation of the more toxic dodecanoic acid which is rapidly transformed to other and less toxic metabolites.</p> <p>Studies showed that the 24 h-LC50 values for killifish in distilled water decreased by a factor of about 10 when the alkyl chain was increased by two carbon atoms. C16 was 10 times more toxic than C14, which was about 10 times more toxic than C12 AS.</p> <p>The toxicity of AS to fish has been demonstrated to increase with increasing alkyl chain length as also seen in studies with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity on Daphnia magna has been determined for chain length C8-C14. Results were comparable to alkyl sulfates in the range between C8 and C10, while C12 and C14 are significantly less toxic. Chronic data obtained for C12 alkane sulfonate sodium and C12-alkyl sulfate sodium with the rotifer\u00a0<i>Brachionus calicyflorus</i>\u00a0similarly show that alkane sulfonates might be less toxic than alkyl sulfates. C16 and C18 alkane sulfonates are assumed to exhibit the same toxicity than alkyl sulfates of comparable chain lengths. No data are available concerning the toxicity of alkane sulfonates on fish and algae. However, a similar toxicity might be assumed because of structural and physico-chemical similarities between the three subcategories</p> <p>Whereas most correlations between AS structure and toxicity show an increasing toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length, the budding in Hydra attenuata was apparently more affected by C10 AS than by C12, C14, and C16 AS. The authors suggested that the decrease in toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length was attributable to reduced solubility in water</p> <p>Tests on the toxicity to microorganisms were only conducted with alkyl sulfates as test substances. A test on the inhibition of respiration of activated sludge resulted in an 3 h-EC50 of 135 mg/l (nominally). The lowest effect value for protozoa was obtained from a test on\u00a0<i>Uronema parduczi</i>\u00a0using C12-alkyl sulfate sodium - \u00a0the 20 h-EC5 was 0.75 mg/l.</p> <p>Experimental test results on benthic organisms in a water-sediment system are not available. However, due to sediment-water partitioning coefficients Kd &lt; 350, no significant risk for organisms in this compartment is to be expected.</p> <p>Data indicate that toxic effects on soil organisms might only be expected at high concentrations for alkyl sulfates. Toxicity of alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates can not be assessed because test results for terrestrial organisms are not available.</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates,</b>\u00a0reliable short-term tests on fish, invertebrates and algae are available. The results indicate that toxicity is increasing as the alkyl chain length increases. The lowest available effect value is the 96 h-LC50 = 0.5 mg/l, determined in tests on\u00a0<i>Oryzias latipes, Rasbora heteromorpha</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Salmo trutta</i></p> <p>Algae show toxic effects to growth when exposed 10-100 mg/l for C14-18 AOS.</p> <p>EC50 values for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>\u00a0have been determined within the range 5-50 mg/l for C14-18 AOS . Another study with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>, showed EC50 values of 16.6 mg/l for C14-16 AOS and 7.7 mg/l for C16-18 AOS.</p> <p>Studies performed with fish show that the higher homologues of AOS are more toxic than the lower ones. This has been illustrated for different fish species (LC50 (96 h) range 0.5-5.3 mg/l)</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:</b>\u00a0The toxicity of various SAS homologues was determined in tests with\u00a0<i>Chlamydomonas variabilis</i><b><i>.</i></b>\u00a0After 24 hours of exposure at 20 C, there was a tendency to an increased toxicity with increasing chain length. The EC50 values were 125 mg/l for C10.3, 74.9 mg/l for C11.2, 32.4 mg/l for C14, 15.8 mg/l for C15, 9.42 mg/l for C16, 3.93 mg/l for C17, 3.71 mg/l for C18.9, and 8.47 mg/l for C20.7.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>SIDS Initial Assessment Profile</p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

LAS are mainly used in laundry detergents and cleaning agents. LAS are\r\nfrequently used as the sodium salts as the sole surfactant in a formulation or\r\nin conjunction with other anionic, nonionic or cationic surfactants. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The chemicals in this group can\r\nhave an alkyl chain between 10 and 16 carbon atoms. The main commercial grade\r\nmaterial is typically limited to a range of 10-14 or 10-13 carbons with a\r\ndodecyl-component of 20-35 %. The carbon chain distribution of the chemicals\r\nwill vary depending on the method of production and the source of the precursor\r\nchemicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">T he chemicals in this group are\r\nexpected to have similar toxicity, which is primarily due to the alkylbenzene\r\nsulfonate anion. They share similar physico-chemical properties, including\r\ndensity and melting points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The solubility of the homologues\r\ndiffers based on the alkyl chain length, usually decreasing with increasing\r\nchain length.However, as the chemicals are also mixtures of positional isomers,\r\nchemicals with the same alkyl chain distribution (same average carbon number)\r\ncan have different properties depending on the 2-phenyl isomer content\r\n(consistent with 4-substitution as the major product with smaller amounts of\r\nthe 2-substitution) </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS consist of an alkyl chain\r\nattached to a benzene ring in the para position to the sulfonate group.\r\nSometimes toluene, xylene and naphthalene are used in place of benzene. The\r\nhomologue distribution in commercial products covers alkyl chain lengths from\r\nC10 to C13 with an average chain length of C11.6. LAS raw materials are derived\r\nfrom linear alkyl benzenes in which the ring is attached to a C-atom which is\r\nitself attached to two other C-atoms. The benzene ring may be attached to any\r\nof the C atoms from C2 to C6 but not to C1. Structures in which the benzene ring\r\nmay be attached to different C atoms are described as isomers. E.g., the\r\nstructure with a C12 alkyl chain and the benzene ring attached at the second\r\nalkyl carbon is designated as the C12-2-isomer and abbreviated C12-2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS can be represented\r\nstructurally as:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">H3C(CH3)xCH(C6H4S)3.Na+)CH2(CH2)yCH3\r\n- x+y=9</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Compared to traditional soaps\r\nbranched alkyl benzenesulfonates (BAS) offer superior tolerance to hard water\r\nand better foaming. However, the highly branched tail made it difficult to\r\nbiodegrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The term \"linear\"\r\nrefers to the starting alkenes rather than the final product. The alkylation of\r\nlinear alkenes, even 1- alkenes such as 1-dodecene gives several isomers of\r\nphenyldodecane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Under ideal conditions the\r\ncleaning power of BAS and LAS is very similar, however LAS performs slightly\r\nbetter in normal use conditions, due to it being less affected by hard water.\r\nWithin LAS itself the detergency of the various isomers are fairly similar,\r\nhowever their physical properties (Krafft point, foaming etc.) are noticeably\r\ndifferent\u00a0 In particular the Krafft point of the high 2-phenyl product remains\r\nbelow 0 deg C up to 25% LAS whereas the low 2-phenyl cloud point is 5 deg C.\r\nThis behavior is often exploited by producers to create either clear or cloudy\r\nproducts.</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>For linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acids (LABS) (and their salts):<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />LABS  are generally highly water soluble (miscible) and have a relatively low  Kow. The environmental fate data indicate that these chemicals are  highly susceptible to photo-and biodegradation.<br />LABS are strong acids  (pKa &lt;1) that are completely ionised in aqueous solutions. The  chemical species present in aqueous solutions at neutral (physiological)  pH is the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (the LAS ion) (C10-14 linear  alkyl benzene-SO3-), the identical species present in solutions of LAS,  where the counter ion (typically sodium, calcium or ammonium) will  disassociate to form the LAS anion. Thus, the physical-chemical,  environmental fate, ecotoxicity and toxicity properties of the LABS and  LAS would be expected to be similar. It should be noted that the LABS  are liquids and LAS is a solid at room temperature. However, in water  the difference between the LAB sulfonic acids and LAS disappears as  dissociation results in the same ion in solution. Therefore, parameters  such as Kow, water solubility and pH/pKa are appropriate to compare. The  octanol-water partition coefficients are around 2 (log Kow) for all of  the chemicals in this category <br />LABS are not expected to volatilise  significantly. Fugacity modeling predicts that most of these chemicals  will partition to the soil and water. Very little partitions to the air  or sediment. <br />Photodegradation is estimated (using EPI Suite  software) to be a significant mechanism for breakdown. Based on the  model estimates, the hydroxyl radical reaction half-lives ranged from  about 7 to 8.6 hours. Estimated data for LAS were similar. Furthermore,  measured data for LAS suggest even more rapid photodegradation, with 95%  of the material degraded within 20 minutes at 20 C in a laboratory  study. <br />Experimental data data indicates that LAS is stable in water. <br />LABS  are generally biodegradable. Measured biodegradation data indicate  substantial microbial degradation under aerobic conditions. For  dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid 69% of the material mineralised after 28  days. Biodegradation of the C10-16 derivatives and the LAS are also  rapid, with 93% or greater of the material degrading within 28 or 37  days. In addition, studies show that straight chain alkylbenzene  sulfonate materials readily degrade, with the shorter chain length  compounds degrading more rapidly\u00a0 Thus, the data indicate that these  chemicals are highly susceptible to degradation, both by photolytic and  microbial mechanisms <br />The initial step in the biodegradation of LABS  under aerobic conditions is an omega -oxidation of the terminal methyl  group of the alkyl chain to form a carboxylic acid. Further degradation  proceeds by a stepwise shortening of the alkyl chain by beta -oxidation  leaving a short-chain sulfophenyl carboxylic acid. In the presence of  molecular oxygen the aromatic ring structure hydrolyses to form a  dihydroxy-benzene structure which is opened before desulfonation of the  formed sulfonated dicarboxylic acid. The final degradation steps have  not been investigated in details but are likely to occur by general  bacterial metabolic routes involving a total mineralisation and  assimilation into biomass . Both the initial omega -oxidation and the  hydroxylation of the ring structure of LAS require molecular oxygen, and  they are not expected to take place under anoxic conditions.<br />The  BioConcentration Factor (BCF) tends to increase with increasing alkyl  chain length but also the position of the aryl sulfonate moiety was  important. A higher BCF was seen for linear alkyl benzenesulfonate  isomers with the aryl sulfonate attached. Available data indicate that  LABS have low to moderate bioaccumulation potential, with a  bioconcentration factor for dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid of 130. LAS  has bioconcentration factors that range from 22 to 87. <br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Numerous  studies have been performed to determine the effects of LABS towards  aquatic organisms. The aquatic effect concentrations that were observed  in these studies are highly variable. This variation is partly related  to the testing of different isomers and homologues, but it may also be  due to the specific test conditions and species. The length of the alkyl  chain is an important factor determining the aquatic toxicity. In  general, the homologues with the highest number of carbons in the alkyl  chain are more toxic than are those with shorter alkyl chains. Today,  commercial LABS have a homologue distribution between C10 and C13 with a  typical average alkyl chain length of C11.6. <br />The widest range in  the toxicity of LABS towards species belonging to the same group is  found for algae\u00a0 Approximately 90% of the data found in the literature  fall between 0.1 and 100 mg/l. Typical ranges of EC50 values are 1 to  100 mg/l for fresh water species and &lt; 1 to 10 mg/l for marine  species. Typical values lie between 29 and 170 mg/l <br />A very low EC100  value of 0.025 mg/l was determined for Gymnodium breve. Previous  studies in which Gymnodium breve was exposed with AES confirm that this  species is highly sensitive to surfactants, and occasionally available  data for Gymnodium breve should therefore not be used for comparison of  the aquatic toxicity between various surfactants.<br />LC50 values have  been found in the range of 1 to 10 mg/l when Daphnia magna were exposed  with LABS homologues between C10 and C13. The acute toxicity of LABS to  Daphnia magna generally increases with increasing alkyl chain length.\u00a0  Typical values lie between 3 and 12 mg/l. <br />A study with the marine  crustacean Acartia tonsa indicated that a C10-13 LAS affected the  survival at 0.54 mg/l (LC50) and the development rate at 0.51 mg/l  (EC50) after 8 days of exposure. The 48 h-LC50 that was obtained in the  same study with Acartia tonsa was 2.1 mg/l. <br />Metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS are reported to have a much lower toxicity to  invertebrates compared to the toxicity of the intact surfactant.<br />The  toxicity of LABS to fish generally increases with increasing alkyl chain  length, and approximately a 10-fold difference in toxicity between  homologues separated by two carbon atoms has been observed. As also  noted for invertebrates, fish are less susceptible to metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS . LC50 values below 1 mg/l were found for  C11.9 (0.71 mg/l), C13 and C14 (both 0.4 mg/l) in studies with fathead  minnow.<br />LABS sorb to sediment with partition coefficients of 50 to  1,000. The toxicity of LABS bound to sediment is relatively low compared  to LABS in solution. NOEC and LOEC values were as high as 319 and 993  mg LABS/kg, respectively, for the sediment-living Chironomus riparius.  The corresponding NOEC for LABS in solution was as low as 2.4 mg/l  indicating that only a small fraction of the sorbed LABS was  bioavailable. LABS dissolved in water may also cause chronic effects  like reduction of the growth rate of the marine mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis. LABS sorbed to sediments did not have similar  effects.<br />Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in  Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment  Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Alkyl-substituted sulfonates have mutagenic potential due to their alkylating properties. Alkylating agents may damage the stem cell which acts as the precursor to components of the blood. Loss of the stem cell may result in pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest. Aplastic anaemia develops due to complete destruction of the stem cells.</p> <p>Absorbed sulfonates are quickly distributed through living systems and are readily excreted. Toxic effects may result from the effects of binding to proteins and the ability of sulfonates to translocate potassium and nitrate (NO3-) ions from cellular to interstitial fluids. Airborne sulfonates may be responsible for respiratory allergies and, in some instances, minor dermal allergies.</p>",

As a water softener; in photography; in textile bleaches; in pulp and paper manufacture; aluminium production; petroleum refining; sealing ponds from leakage; coal liquefaction catalyst; food additive.|A naturally occurring form of sodium carbonate decahydrate with 17% sodium bicarbonate, called Natron (CAS RN: 7542-12-3), is commercially available and. has been used for thousands of years as a cleaning product for both the home and body. Blended with oil, it was an early form of soap. It softens water while removing oil and grease. Undiluted, natron was a cleanser for the teeth and an early mouthwash. The mineral was mixed into early antiseptics for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, was used for making leather and as a bleach for clothing.|The mineral was used in Egyptian mummification because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, when exposed to moisture the carbonate in natron increases pH (raises alkalinity), which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both the living and the dead. Natron was added to castor oil to make a smokeless fuel, which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.|Natron is an ingredient for making a distinct color called Egyptian blue. It was used along with sand and lime in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until 640 AD. The mineral was also employed as a flux to solder precious metals together.",

Impurities of sodium carbonate may include water (< 1.5 %), sodium chloride (< 0.5 %), sulphate (< 0.1 %), calcium (< 0.1 %), magnesium (< 0.1 %) and iron (< 0.004 %). The purity and the impurity profile depends on the composition of the raw materials, the production process and the intended use of the product. For example the purity of the pharmaceutical grade must be higher than 99.5 % in Europe|The average particle size diameter (d50) of light sodium carbonate is in the range of 90 to 150 um and of dense sodium carbonate is in the range of 250 to 500 um.",

For this reason the effect of sodium carbonate on the organisms depends on the buffer capacity of the aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem.\u00a0</p> <p>Individual aquatic ecosystems are characterized by a specific pH and bicarbonate concentration and the organisms of the ecosystem are adapted to these specific natural conditions. Because the natural pH, bicarbonate and also the sodium concentration (and their fluctuations in time) varies significantly between aquatic ecosystems, it is not considered useful to derive a generic PNEC or PNECadded. To assess the potential environmental effect of a sodium carbonate discharge, the increase in sodium, bicarbonate and pH should be compared with the natural values and their fluctuations and based on this comparison it should be assessed if the anthropogenic addition is acceptable.</p> <p>The production and use of sodium carbonate could potentially result in an emission of sodium carbonate and it could locally increase the pH in the aquatic environment. However, the pH of effluents is normally measured very frequently and can be adapted easily and therefore a significant increase of the pH of the receiving water is not expected. If emissions of waste water are controlled by appropriate pH limits and/or dilutions in relation to the natural pH and buffering capacity of the receiving water, adverse effects on the aquatic environment are not expected due to production or use of sodium carbonate.</p> <p>The sodium ion will not adsorb to particulate matter, but remains in the aqueous phase. In water the carbonate ions will re-equilibrate until an equilibrium is established.</p> <p>The main equilibria are:</p> <p>HCO3- &lt;-&gt; CO3 (2+)-\u00a0+ H+ \u00a0 \u00a0 pKa = 10.35</p> <p>CO2\u00a0+ H2O &lt;-&gt; HCO3--\u00a0+ H+ \u00a0 \u00a0pKa = 6.33</p> <p>The carbonate will finally be incorporated into the inorganic and organic carbon cycle.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate EC50 (48 h): Cladoceran ceriodaphnia cf Dubia: 200-227 mg/l (immobilisation)</p> <p>The variation in acute toxicity for aquatic organisms may be explained for a significant extent by the variation in buffer capacity of the test medium. In general, mortality of the test organisms was found at concentrations higher than 100 mg/l but for Amphipoda, salmon and trout lethal effects were already observed at 67- 80 mg/l although these studies had a low reliability.</p> <p>Aquatic sodium emissions originating from uses of sodium carbonate are probably small compared to other sources.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis of epidemiological data, the material is regarded as carcinogenic to humans. There is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>When administered by inhalation, formaldehyde induced squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal cavity in rats of both sexes. Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p>",
