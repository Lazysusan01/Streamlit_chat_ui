Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>aldehydes</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

A number of BPA-degrading bacteria have been\r\nisolated from enrichments of sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The first\r\nstep in the biodegradation of BPA is the hydroxylation of the carbon atom of a\r\nmethyl group or the quaternary carbon in the BPA molecule.

Loss of the stem cell may result in  pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and  platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the  individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular  leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder  involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red  blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest. Aplastic  anaemia develops due to complete destruction of the stem cells.<br />Reported  adverse effects in laboratory animals include sensitization, and skin  and eye irritation, as well as mutagenic and tumorigenic activity..<br />Testicular  abnormalities (including testicular atrophy with decreased  spermatogenic activity) following exposure to glycidyl ethers\u00a0 have been  reported. Haemopoietic abnormalities following exposure to glycidyl  ethers, including alteration of the leukocyte count, atrophy of lymphoid  tissue, and bone marrow cytotoxicity have also been reported. These  abnormalities were usually observed along with pneumonia and/or toxemia,  and therefore may be secondary effects. However, especially in light of  the generalized reduction in leukocytes and the atrophy of lymphoid  tissues, the observed haemopoietic abnormalities may have been  predisposing factors to pneumonia.

More specifically,\r\nbisphenol A closely mimics the structure and function of the hormone oestradiol\r\nwith the ability to bind to and activate the same oestrogen receptor as the\r\nnatural hormone.

The\r\nexpression of leptin as well as several enzymes and transcription factors is\r\nalso affected by BPA exposure in vivo as well as in vitro. Together, the\r\naltered expression and activity of these important mediators of fat metabolism\r\ncould explain the increase in weight following BPA exposure in rodent models.\r\nThese results also suggest that, together with other obesogens, low,\r\nenvironmentally relevant levels of BPA may contribute to the human obesity\r\nphenomenon.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers\r\n(BADGEs) produce sensitisation dermatitis characterised by a papular, vesicular\r\neczema with considerable itching of the back of the hand, the forearm and face\r\nand neck.
