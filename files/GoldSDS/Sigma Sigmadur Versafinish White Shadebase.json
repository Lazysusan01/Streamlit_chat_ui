The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>for inorganic sulfates:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Data from tap water studies with human volunteers indicate that sulfates produce a laxative effect at concentrations of 1000 - 1200 mg/litre, but no increase in diarrhoea, dehydration or weight loss. The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable taste; the lowest taste threshold concentration for sulfate is approximately 250 mg/litre as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems. No health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/litre.</p> <p>Sulfates are removed from the air by both dry and wet deposition processes. Wet deposition processes including rain-out (a process that occurs within the clouds) and washout (removal by precipitation below the clouds) contribute to the removal of sulfate from the atmosphere.</p> <p>In soil, the inorganic sulfates can adsorb to soil particles or leach into surface water and groundwater. Sulfates can be taken up by plants and be incorporated into the parenchyma of the plant.</p> <p>Sulfate in water can also be reduced by sulfate bacteria (<i>Thiobacilli</i>) which use them as a source of energy.</p> <p>In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle. Sodium sulfate is not reactive in aqueous solution at room temperature. Sodium sulfate will completely dissolve, ionise and distribute across the entire planetary \"aquasphere\". Some sulfates may eventually be deposited, the majority of sulfates participate in the sulfur cycle in which natural and industrial sodium sulfate are not distinguishable</p> <p>The BCF of sodium sulfate is very low and therefore significant bioconcentration is not expected. Sodium and sulfate ions are essential to all living organisms and their intracellular and extracellular concentrations are actively regulated. However some plants (e.g. corn and\u00a0<i>Kochia Scoparia</i>), are capable of accumulating sulfate to concentrations that are potentially toxic to ruminants.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For sulfate in general:</p> <p>Fish LC50: \u00a0toxic from 7000 mg/l</p> <p>Bacteria: toxic from \u00a02500 mg/l</p> <p>Algae were shown to be the most sensitive to sodium sulfate; EC50 120 h = 1,900 mg/l. For invertebrates\u00a0<i>(Daphnia magna)\u00a0</i>the EC50 48 h = 4,580 mg/l and fish appeared to be the least sensitive with a LC50 96h = 7,960 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>. Activated sludge showed a very low sensitivity to sodium sulfate. There was no effect up to 8 g/l. Sodium sulfate is not very toxic to terrestrial plants.\u00a0<i>Picea banksiana\u00a0</i>was the most sensitive species, an effect was seen at 1.4 g/l. Sediment dwelling organisms were not very sensitive either, with an LC50 96h = 660 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Trycorythus sp</i>. Overall it can be concluded that sodium sulfate has no acute adverse effect on aquatic and sediment dwelling organisms. Toxicity to terrestrial plants is also low.</p> <p>No data were found for long term toxicity. The acute studies all show a toxicity of sodium sulfate higher than 100 mg/l, no bioaccumulation is expected,</p> <p><span>For barium and its compounds::</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The length of time that barium will last in\r\nair, land, water, or sediments following release of barium into these media\r\ndepends on the form of barium released. Barium compounds that do not dissolve\r\nwell in water, such as barium sulfate and barium carbonate, can persist for a\r\nlong time in the environment. Barium compounds, such as barium chloride, barium\r\nnitrate, or barium hydroxide, that dissolve easily in water usually do not last\r\nin these forms for a long time in the environment. The barium in these\r\ncompounds that is dissolved in water quickly combines with sulfate or carbonate\r\nthat are naturally found in water and become the longer lasting forms (barium\r\nsulfate and barium carbonate). </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Under natural conditions, barium is stable\r\nin the +2 valence state and is found primarily in the form of inorganic\r\ncomplexes. Conditions such as pH, Eh (oxidation-reduction potential), cation\r\nexchange capacity, and the presence of sulfate, carbonate, and metal oxides\r\n(e.g., oxides of aluminum, manganese, silicon, and titanium) will affect the\r\npartitioning of barium and its compounds in the environment. The major features\r\nof the biogeochemical cycle of barium include wet and dry deposition to land\r\nand surface water, leaching from geological formations to groundwater,\r\nadsorption to soil and sediment particulates, and biomagnification in\r\nterrestrial and aquatic food chains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium is a highly reactive metal that\r\noccurs naturally only in a combined state. The element is released to\r\nenvironmental media by both natural processes and anthropogenic sources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The general population is exposed to barium\r\nthrough consumption of drinking water and foods, usually at low levels. Most\r\nbarium released to the environment from industrial sources is in forms that do\r\nnot become widely dispersed. In the atmosphere, barium is likely to be present\r\nin particulate form. Although chemical reactions may cause changes in\r\nspeciation of barium in air, the main mechanisms for the removal of barium\r\ncompounds from the atmosphere are likely to be wet and dry deposition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In aquatic media, barium is likely to\r\nprecipitate out of solution as an insoluble salt (i.e., as BaSO4 or BaCO3).\r\nWaterborne barium may also adsorb to suspended particulate matter through the\r\nformation of ion pairs with natural anions such as bicarbonate or sulfate in\r\nthe matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Precipitation of barium sulfate salts is\r\naccelerated when rivers enter the ocean because of the high sulfate content\r\n(905 mg/L) in the ocean. It is estimated that only 0.006% of the total barium\r\ninput into oceans from freshwater sources remains in solution. Sedimentation of\r\nsuspended solids removes a large portion of the barium content from surface\r\nwaters. There is evidence to suggest that the precipitation of barium from the\r\nsurface of fresh and marine waters occurs, in part, as the result of the barite\r\ncrystal formation in microorganisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium in sediments is found largely in the\r\nform of barium sulfate (barite). Coarse silt sediment in a turbulent\r\nenvironment will often grind and cleave the barium sulfate from the sediment\r\nparticles leaving a buildup of dense barites. Estimated soil:water distribution\r\ncoefficients (Kd) (i.e., the ratio of the quantity of barium sorbed per gram of\r\nsorbent to the concentration of barium remaining in solution at equilibrium)\r\nrange from 200 to 2,800 for sediments and sandy loam soils. The uptake of\r\nbarium by fish and marine organisms is also an important removal mechanism.\r\nBarium levels in sea water range from 2 to 63 \u00b5g/L with a mean concentration of\r\nabout 13 \u00b5g/L. Barium was found to bioconcentrate in marine plants by a factor\r\nof 400-4,000 times the level present in the water. Bioconcentration factors in\r\nmarine animals, plankton, and brown algae of 100, 120, and 260, respectively,\r\nhave been reported. In freshwater, a bioconcentration factor of 129 was\r\nestimated in fish where the barium in water was 0.07 mg/L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium added to soils (e.g., from the land\r\nfarming of waste drilling muds) may either be taken up by vegetation or\r\ntransported through soil with precipitation. Relative to the amount of barium\r\nfound in soils, little is typically bioconcentrated by plants. For example, a\r\nbioconcentration factor of 0.4 has been estimated for plants in a Virginia\r\nfloodplain with a barium soil concentration of 104.2 mg/kg . However, there are\r\nsome plants, such as legumes, forage plants, Brazil nuts, and mushrooms that\r\naccumulate barium. Bioconcentration factors from 2 to 20 have been reported for\r\ntomatoes and soybeans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium is not very mobile in most soil\r\nsystems, due to the formation of water-insoluble salts and an inability of the\r\nbarium ion to form soluble complexes with fulvic and humic acids. The rate of\r\ntransportation of barium in soil is dependent on the characteristics of the\r\nsoil material. Soil properties that influence the transportation of barium to\r\ngroundwater are cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content and\r\npH. In soil with a high cation exchange capacity (e.g., fine textured mineral\r\nsoils or soils with high organic matter content), barium mobility will be\r\nlimited by adsorption. High CaCO3 content limits mobility by precipitation of\r\nthe element as BaCO3. Barium will also precipitate as barium sulfate in the\r\npresence of sulfate ions. Barium is more mobile and is more likely to be\r\nleached from soils in the presence of chloride due to the high solubility of\r\nbarium chloride as compared to other chemical forms of barium. Barium may become\r\nmore mobile in soils under acid conditions as barium in water-insoluble salts,\r\nsuch as barium sulfate and carbonate, becomes more soluble. Barium complexes\r\nwith fatty acids (e.g., in acidic landfill leachate) will be much more mobile\r\nin the soil due to the lower charge of these complexes and subsequent reduction\r\nin adsorption capacity.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

It is not\r\nbiodegradable. Due to its insolubility in water there is a separation at every\r\nfiltration and sedimentation process.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Crystalline and/or amorphous silicas are ubiquitous on the earth\r\nin soils and sediments, and in living organisms (e.g. diatoms), but only the\r\ndissolved form is bioavailable. On a global scale, the level of man-made\r\nsynthetic amorphous silicas (SAS) represents up to 2.4% of the dissolved silica\r\nnaturally present in the aquatic environment. The rate of SAS released into the\r\nenvironment during the product life cycle is negligible in comparison with the\r\nnatural flux of silica in the environment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Untreated SASs have a relatively low water solubility of 1.91 to\r\n2.51 mmol/l (114 - 151 mg/l) and an extremely low vapour pressure (e.g. &lt;\r\n10\u20133 Pa at 20\u00b0 C for Aerosil R972). On the basis of these properties it is\r\nexpected that SAS released into the environment will be distributed mainly into\r\nsoil/sediment, slightly into water, and probably not at all into air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With surface-treated SASs, the addition of organosilicon compounds\r\nincreases the hydrophobicity. Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low. Due to the\r\npresence of organic substances such as surfactants, salts, acids and alkalis in\r\nthe environment, it is expected that surface-treated silica will be wetted and\r\nthen adsorbed onto soils or sediments</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SAS is regarded as an inert substance and is not expected to\r\nundergo any transformation in the atmospheric or terrestrial compartment, apart\r\nfrom dissolution by water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradability in sewage treatment plant or in surface water is\r\nnot applicable to inorganic substances like SAS. Therefore the biodegradation\r\nendpoint has limited relevance for SAS. In surface modified SASs, the most\r\ncommon treating agents are organosilicon compounds and these generally\r\nrepresent less than 5% of the material. Biodegradation in sewage treatment\r\nplant or in surface water is not expected. Some biodegradation in soil may\r\noccur by analogy with the behaviour of linear polydimethylsiloxane in this\r\ncompartment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on available data, SAS is not toxic to environmental\r\norganisms (apart from physical desiccation in insects).

The observed\r\neffects were likely caused by physical hampering of the\u00a0<i>Daphnia\u00a0</i>due\r\nto the presence of undissolved particles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A surface-treated SAS (Aerosil R974; 99.9% pure) was tested on\r\nfish and crustaceans.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>The synthetic, amorphous silicas are believed to represent a very greatly reduced silicosis hazard compared to crystalline silicas and are considered to be nuisance dusts.</p> <p>When heated to high temperature and a long time, amorphous silica can produce crystalline silica on cooling. Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis. The material did not appear to be absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantity to produce outward signs of toxicity.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

Volatilisation of methyl n-propyl ketone from moist soil surfaces is expected given a measured Henry's Law constant of 8.4x10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilisation from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon the measured vapor pressure of 35.4 mm Hg at 25 deg C. Methyl n-propyl ketone has been shown to biodegrade under aerobic and conditions.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: The estimated Koc value indicates that methyl n-propyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Methyl n-propyl ketone is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 and 159, hours respectively. Biodegradation of this compound is anticipated, but volatilisation is expected to be the primary removal mechanism of methyl n-propyl ketone in waters. An estimated BCF value of 3, from an experimental log Kow, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and its vapour pressure, methyl n-propyl ketone will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl n-propyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 79 hours.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Volatilisation of n-butyl acetate is expected from moist soil surfaces given its Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilisation from dry soil surfaces is expected based on a measured vapor pressure of 11.5 mm Hg. Using a standard BOD dilution technique and a sewage inoculum, theoretical BODs of 56 % to 86 % were observed during 5-20 day incubation periods, which suggests that n-butyl acetate may biodegrade in soil.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value indicates that n-butyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Butyl acetate is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on a Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 127, hours respectively. An estimated BCF value of 10 based on the log Kow, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using a filtered sewage seed, 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 58 % and 83 % were measured in freshwater dilution tests; 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 40 % and 61 % were measured in salt water. A 5-day theoretical BOD of 56.8 % and 51.8 % were measured for n-butyl acetate in distilled water and seawater, respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate for this compound based upon experimentally determined hydrolysis half-lives of 114 and 11 days at pH 8 and 9 respectively.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, n-butyl acetate, which has a vapour pressure of 11.5 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase n-butyl acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 4 days</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h, 23 C): island silverside (Menidia beryllina) 185 ppm (static bioassay in synthetic seawater, mild aeration applied after 24 h); bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 100 ppm (static bioassay in fresh water, mild aeration applied after 24 h)</p> <p>Fish EC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 18 mg/l (affected fish lost equilibrium prior to death)\u00a0</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (48 h): 44 ppm</p> <p>Algal LC50 (96 h): Scenedesmus 320 ppm</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p>"

The two isomeric forms are shown above. The di- and tripropylene glycol ethers may form up to 4 and 8 isomeric forms, respectively. Even so, all isomers exhibit either the \"alpha\" or \"beta\" configuration, existing as secondary or primary alcohols, respectively. The distribution of isomeric forms for the di- and tripropylene glycols, as with the mono-PGEs, also results in predominantly the alpha form (i.e., a secondary alcohol). It should be noted that only the alpha isomer and isomeric mixtures (consisting predominantly of the alpha isomer) are produced commercially; the purified beta isomer is not produced at this time.</p>",

Calculated BCFs range from 1.47 for DPnB to 3.16 for DPMA and TPM, indicating low bioaccumulation. Henry's Law Constants, which indicate propensity to partition from water to air, are low for all category members, ranging from 5.7 x 10-9 atm-m3/mole for TPM to 2.7 x10-9 atm-m3/mole for PnB. Fugacity modeling indicates that most propylene glycol ethers are likely to partition roughly equally into the soil and water compartments in the environment with small to negligible amounts remaining in other environmental compartments (air, sediment, and aquatic biota). Propylene glycol ethers are unlikely to persist in the environment. Once in air, the half-life of the category members due to direct reactions with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals, range from 2.0 hours for TPM to 4.6 hours for PnB. In water, most \u00a0members of this family \u00a0are \"readily biodegradable\" under aerobic conditions. (DPMA degraded within 28 days (and within the specified 10-day window) but only using pre-adapted or \"acclimated\" inoculum.).

For acetates, effect concentrations are &gt; 151 mg/L.</p> <p>For glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Ether groups are generally stable to hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. OECD guideline studies indicate ready biodegradability for several glycol ethers although higher molecular weight species seem to biodegrade at a slower rate. No glycol ethers that have been tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes. Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr). When released to water, glycol ethers undergo biodegradation (typically 47-92% after 8-21 days) and have a low potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow ranges from -1.73 to +0.51).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic toxicity data indicate that the tri- and tetra ethylene glycol ethers are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.

Differences in the teratogenic potential of the alpha (commercial grade) and beta isomers of PGMEA may be explained by the formation of different metabolites. The beta-isomer is thought to be oxidised to methoxypropionic acid, a homologue to methoxyacetic acid which is a known teratogen. The alpha- form is conjugated and excreted. PGMEA mixture (containing 2% to 5% beta isomer) is a mild skin and eye irritant, produces mild central nervous system effects in animals at 3000 ppm and produces mild CNS impairment and upper respiratory tract and eye irritation in humans at 1000 ppm. In rats exposed to 3000 ppm PGMEA produced slight foetotoxic effects (delayed sternabral ossification) - no effects on foetal development were seen in rabbits exposed at 3000 ppm.</p> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The main effects of simple aliphatic esters are narcosis and irritation and anaesthesia at higher concentrations. These effects become greater as the molecular weights and boiling points increase. Central nervous system depression , headache, drowsiness, dizziness, coma and neurobehavioral changes may also be symptomatic of overexposure. Respiratory tract involvement may produce mucous membrane irritation, dyspnea, and tachypnea, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis and, in massive exposures, pulmonary oedema (which may be delayed). Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Liver and kidney damage may result from massive exposures.</p> <p>Mice exposed at up to 3000 ppm PGMEA 6 hr/day for a total of 9 days during an 11-day period showed no pronounced effect on the weights of liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, thymus or testes.

In a further study, no developmental effects were seen following exposure of pregnant rats at air concentrations of commercial propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (containing 3-5% of the minor component) up to 4000 ppm; slight maternal effects were seen at 5000 ppm and greater.</p> <p>Exposure of pregnant rats and rabbits to the parent glycol ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether which contained comparable amounts of the primary isomer, 2-methoxy-1-propanol, did not produce teratogenic effects at concentrations up to 3000 ppm. Foetotoxic effects were seen in rat foetuses but not in rabbit foetuses at this concentration and maternal toxicity was noted in both species at this concentration</p> <p>Studies with some glycol ethers (principally the monoethylene glycols) and their esters indicate reproductive changes, testicular atrophy, infertility and kidney function changes. The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>No exposure limits set by NOHSC or ACGIH</p> #CEL TWA: 50 ppm, 320 mg/m3  (as heptyl acetate)   [Manufacturer]",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.
