In medicine as component of ointments (zinc cream), cosmetics, lotions, dusting powders, bandages. Zinc oxide is a bacteriostat not a bactericide. Manufacture of opaque glass and certain transparent glasses; electrostatic copying paper; as flame retardant; in electronics as semiconductor. Used in some animal food additives and fertilizers.|Zinc calcine is impure zinc oxide producing following roasting of zinc sulfide - contains iron, cadmium, copper, arsenic, antimony, cobalt, germanium, nickel and thallium.|Ceramic grades are often calcined to remove any physical water (so they do not clump in the bag). These grades also have a larger particle size and lower surface area (e.g. 3 square meters per gram vs. less than 1; however 99.9% still passes 325 mesh). While calcined grades are said to produce less glaze surface defect problems, many ceramists have used the raw grades without serious issues. You Calcined (or re-calcined) zinc is produced in a bisque kiln at around 815 deg C.|[~Intermediate ~]",

As negative charges on soil surfaces increase with increasing pH,\r\nadditional sites for zinc adsorption are activated and the amount of zinc in\r\nsolution decreases. The active zinc species in the adsorbed state is the singly\r\ncharged zinc hydroxide species (i.e., Zn[OH]+).

On the\r\nother hand, the amount of zinc in solution generally increases when the pH is\r\n&gt;7 in soils high in organic matter. This is a result of the release of\r\norganically complexed zinc, reduced zinc adsorption at higher pH, or an\r\nincrease in the concentration of chelating agents in soil. For calcareous\r\nsoils, the relationship between zinc solubility and pH is nonlinear. At a high\r\npH, zinc in solution is precipitated as Zn(OH)2, zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), or\r\ncalcium zincate.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>for zinc oxide:</p> <p>Zinc oxide intoxication (intoxication zincale) is characterised by general depression, shivering, headache, thirst, colic and diarrhoea.</p> <p>Exposure to the fume may produce metal fume fever characterised by chills, muscular pain, nausea and vomiting.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage.

Vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, in several cases with blood, have been observed after ingestion of zinc sulfate.</p> <p>Several cases of gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported after ingestion of zinc sulfate. A significant reduction in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (47% decrease), hematocrit, and serum ferritin, compared to pretreatment levels, occurred in female subjects who received supplements (as capsules) of 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 10 weeks. A 15% decrease in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was reported in male volunteers receiving 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 6 weeks. Another study reported increases in bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels (~25%) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (~15%), while significant decreases were seen in mononuclear white cell 5'-nucleotidase (~30%) and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activity (~36%) following exposure of postmenopausal women to a combined (dietary+supplemental) 53 mg zinc/day as zinc glycine chelate. Healthy men given 200 mg zinc/day as elemental zinc for 6 weeks showed a reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response to phytohemagglutinin as well as chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.; however, no changes in lymphocyte cell number or in the proportion of lymphocyte populations were noted. Exposure of male volunteers to 0.48 mg zinc/kg/day, as zinc glycine chelate, had no effect on markers of coagulation relative to unexposed subjects. While the changes in</p> <p>hematological end points following long-term zinc exposure in humans are noteworthy, they were subclinical in nature, and therefore, are generally considered to be non-adverse. In animals, following oral administration of zinc compounds, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte, and/or leukocyte levels were observed in rats, mice, rabbits , dogs, ferrets, and preruminant calves A number of intermediate-duration studies have demonstrated renal effects in animals exposed to zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc acetate. Zinc sulfate caused an increase in the absolute and relative kidney weights and regressive kidney lesions (not specified) in female mice that consumed 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day in the diet for 13 weeks, but no effects occurred in rats that consumed 565 mg zinc/kg/day or in mice that consumed 104 mg zinc/kg/day under similar conditions. Severe diffuse nephrosis was</p> <p>observed in ferrets exposed to 195 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet . In rats exposed to 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 3 months, epithelial cell damage in the glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubules and increased plasma creatinine and urea levels were observed. Zinc plays a role in the normal development and maintenance of the immune system, such as in the lymphocyte response to mitogens and as a cofactor for the thymic hormone thymulin. Oral exposure to zinc at levels much higher than the recommended daily dose has impaired immune and inflammatory responses. This was observed in in vivo investigations of the immune competence of blood components taken from 11 healthy adult men after ingestion of 4.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 6 weeks. The mitogenic response elicited from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the chemotactic and phagocytic responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were impaired after zinc ingestion. No effects were seen on total numbers of lymphocytes or relative numbers of T cells, T cell subsets, or B cells. The relationship between these observations and decreased levels of immune competence that might lead to increased susceptibility to disease is unknown. A later study reported no effects of supplementation of male volunteers with 30 mg zinc/day (0.43 mg zinc/kg/day assuming a reference male body weight of 70 kg) as zinc glycine chelate for 14 weeks on levels of peripheral blood leucocytes or on the frequency of lymphocyte subsets.</p> <p>Zinc appears to be necessary for normal brain function, but excess zinc is toxic. A 16-year-old boy who ingested .86 mg zinc/kg/day of metallic zinc over a 2-day period in an attempt to promote wound healing, developed signs and symptoms of lethargy, light-headedness, staggering, and difficulty in writing clearly . Lethargy was also observed in a 2-year-old child who ingested a zinc chloride solution (.1,000 mg zinc/kg). It is not known whether these observations represent direct effects on the nervous system. Very limited data were located regarding neurological effects in animals. Minor neuron degeneration and proliferation of oligodendroglia occurred in rats dosed with 487 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 10 days. Rats receiving 472 mg zinc/kg/day for 10 days had increased levels of secretory material in the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus.

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Following an oral intake of\r\nextremely high doses of zinc (where 300 mg Zn/d \u2013 20 times the US Recommended\r\nDietary Allowance (RDA) \u2013 is a &quot;low intake&quot; overdose), nausea,\r\nvomiting, pain, cramps and diarrhea may occur.

Three of the women had premature deliveries, and one delivered a\r\nstillborn infant.

The developmental toxicity of zinc in experimental animals has\r\nbeen evaluated in a number of investigations.

At present, little is known\r\nabout their additional hormonal activities in different hormonal receptor\r\nsystems despite their increasing use and environmental persistence. Besides\r\nestrogenic activity, UV filters may have additional activities, both agonistic\r\nand antagonistic in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Systematic analysis of the oestrogenic, antioestrogenic,\r\nandrogenic, and antiandrogenic activity was conducted using 18 UV filters and\r\none metabolite\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0at non-cytotoxic concentrations with\r\nrecombinant yeast systems carrying either a human estrogen (hER) or androgen\r\nreceptor (hAR). All 19 compounds elicited hormonal activities, surprisingly\r\nmost of them multiple activities. Ten UV-filters having agonistic effects\r\ntowards the hER. Surprisingly, six UV filters with androgenic activities and\r\nmany of them having pronounced antioestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities.\r\nSeventeen compounds inhibited 4,5-dihydrotestosterone activity in the hAR\r\nassay, while 14 compounds inhibited oestradiol activity in the hER assay,\r\nindicating antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, respectively. In\r\nparticular, the antiandrogenic activities of phenyl- and benzyl salicylate,\r\nbenzophenone-1 and -2, and of 4-hydroxybenzophenone were higher than that of\r\nflutamide, a known hAR antagonist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although most of the UV filters exert hormonal effects at\r\nconcentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in the environment,\r\nwide distribution and exposure to UV filter mixtures may have environmental\r\nconsequences due to additive effects. The UV filters 4-methylbenzylidene\r\ncamphor, benzophenone-3, \u00a0benzophenone-4, octyl methoxycinnamate,\r\noctocrylene and homosalate that repeatedly were detected in the aquatic\r\nenvironment, may contribute with their multiple hormonal activities in a\r\ncomplex manner to the mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals already present\r\nin surface water and fish. For most of the UV filters with multiple hormonal\r\nactivities residues in the aquatic environment and in biota are not yet known,\r\nand therefore their environmental relevance remains elusive. The fact that all\r\n18 UV filters and one metabolite showed receptor ligand binding via\r\ntransactivation \u2013 surprisingly most of them multiple bindings \u2013 reveals a\r\ncomplex picture of the hormonal activities of UV filters</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petra Kunz and Karl Fent: Aquatic Toxicology Vol 79 pp 305-324\r\nOctober 2006</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

This data do not\r\nindicate any genotoxic potential which means that such an effect of 2-EHA is\r\nnot likely either. As 2-EHA can induce both DNA synthesis and inhibition of\r\nintercellular communication\u00a0 in hepatic cells, a tumour-promoting potential in\r\nrodents, comparable to that of other peroxisome proliferators, cannot be ruled\r\nout.

One\r\nmechanism proposed involves the development of free radicals following UVB\r\nabsorption by the chemical agent; free radicals are potentially damaging to\r\nDNA.\u00a0 A further mechanism involves the inhibition of Vitamin D production; low\r\nlevels of Vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of the development\r\nof breast and colon cancer and may also accelerate the growth of melanoma.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While sunscreens have been\r\neffective in protecting against a variety of UV-related pathologies, such as\r\nsunburns, actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas\u00a0 growing\r\npopularity and thus, possibility for exposure questions their safety in\r\nenvironment and human health. Available data imply, that sunscreen compounds\r\nmight block vitamin D synthesis or act as endocrine disruptor and lead to\r\ndevelopmental toxicity. The effects of sunscreen on cutaneous synthesis of\r\nvitamin D induced by sunlight have been a subject of debate, however the newest\r\nanalysis suggests, that normal usage of sunscreen by adults do not decrease\r\ncutaneous synthesis of vitamin D . The endocrine disruptive and developmental\r\ntoxicity of many organic UV filters in experimental models is well established,\r\nthese filters seem to be associated with altered estrogen, androgen and\r\nprogesterone activity, reproductive and developmental toxicity and impaired\r\nfunctioning of the thyroid, liver or kidneys, reviewed elsewhere.\u00a0 Since many\r\nof UV filters were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the risk for\r\nneurotoxicity also occurs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Organic or chemical filters are\r\nthe most popular and widely used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.\r\nOrganic filters can be classified by the type of ultraviolet (UV) radiation\r\nthey absorb, namely UVB, UVA or UVB-UVA filters. The main route of human\r\nexposure is dermal absorption, however other routes and environmental exposure\r\nshould be also considered. The last is particularly true for organic filters,\r\nwhich, due to their high lipophilicity could bioaccumulate in aquatic organism\r\nand reach humans through the food chain. Thus, they also are emergent as an\r\nenvironmental pollutant. Chemical UV filters are easily absorbed by the skin\r\nand reach the systemic circulation, and accumulate in various tissues, as\r\nadipose tissue, liver and the brain. Their lipophilicity permits them to\r\nreadily cross the BBB. There is a wide range of in vitro and in vivo studies of\r\nthe toxic effects of UV filters as endocrine disruptors. Since it is known that\r\nother chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors can impair neuronal\r\ntransmission, synaptic plasticity and produce neurotoxic effects [ chemical\r\nfilters might potentially produce similar effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Inorganic (physical) ingredients\r\nused in modern sunscreens include metal oxide particles, typically titanium\r\ndioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), which occurs typically at 5-10%\r\nconcentration (maximum allowed is 25%). While chemical filters still dominate\r\nin sunscreen products, the usage of physical compounds is constantly growing.\r\nOne of the reasons is that they have a higher spectrum of protection - TiO2 is\r\nvery effective in absorbing UVB, while ZnO absorbs mainly the UVA range, and\r\nthe combination of both particles provides a broad UV protection. Other\r\nadvantages of physical filters are lack of skin sensitization and limited skin\r\npenetration. However, these mineral filters, when in normal pigment size range\r\n(200-400 nm for ZnO, 150-300 nm for TiO2) have poor particle dispersion, which\r\nmakes them difficult to apply; they also reflect and scatter light, which\r\nresult in undesirable visible white film on the skin. With nanotechnology,\r\nthese materials can be reduced to nanoparticles (NPs) (&lt;100 nm) which are\r\neasier to apply and are transparent on the skin . Nevertheless, with\r\nmicronization some properties are changed - they may be more bioreactive and\r\neasier penetrate the skin and other tissues, leading to concerns about their\r\nsafety use. Moreover, part of the absorbed UV radiation can generate free\r\nradicals on the surface of metal oxides in the presence of water and this\r\nphotocatalytic activity increases with decreasing NPs size. NP-induced cyto-\r\nand genotoxicity has been associated with increased photocatalytic activity,\r\nleading to increased production of free radicals</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

At present, little is known\r\nabout their additional hormonal activities in different hormonal receptor\r\nsystems despite their increasing use and environmental persistence. Besides\r\nestrogenic activity, UV filters may have additional activities, both agonistic\r\nand antagonistic in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Systematic analysis of the oestrogenic, antioestrogenic,\r\nandrogenic, and antiandrogenic activity was conducted using 18 UV filters and\r\none metabolite\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0at non-cytotoxic concentrations with\r\nrecombinant yeast systems carrying either a human estrogen (hER) or androgen\r\nreceptor (hAR). All 19 compounds elicited hormonal activities, surprisingly\r\nmost of them multiple activities. Ten UV-filters having agonistic effects\r\ntowards the hER. Surprisingly, six UV filters with androgenic activities and\r\nmany of them having pronounced antioestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities.\r\nSeventeen compounds inhibited 4,5-dihydrotestosterone activity in the hAR\r\nassay, while 14 compounds inhibited oestradiol activity in the hER assay,\r\nindicating antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, respectively. In\r\nparticular, the antiandrogenic activities of phenyl- and benzyl salicylate,\r\nbenzophenone-1 and -2, and of 4-hydroxybenzophenone were higher than that of\r\nflutamide, a known hAR antagonist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although most of the UV filters exert hormonal effects at\r\nconcentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in the environment,\r\nwide distribution and exposure to UV filter mixtures may have environmental\r\nconsequences due to additive effects. The UV filters 4-methylbenzylidene\r\ncamphor, benzophenone-3, \u00a0benzophenone-4, octyl methoxycinnamate,\r\noctocrylene and homosalate that repeatedly were detected in the aquatic\r\nenvironment, may contribute with their multiple hormonal activities in a\r\ncomplex manner to the mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals already present\r\nin surface water and fish. For most of the UV filters with multiple hormonal\r\nactivities residues in the aquatic environment and in biota are not yet known,\r\nand therefore their environmental relevance remains elusive. The fact that all\r\n18 UV filters and one metabolite showed receptor ligand binding via\r\ntransactivation \u2013 surprisingly most of them multiple bindings \u2013 reveals a\r\ncomplex picture of the hormonal activities of UV filters</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petra Kunz and Karl Fent: Aquatic Toxicology Vol 79 pp 305-324\r\nOctober 2006</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|Not readily biodegradable|BCF 36-158|Fish LC50 (96 h): orange-red killfish (Oryzias latipes) 3.8 mg/l (OECD 203); NOEC 0.72 mg/l|Daphnia magna EC50 (48 h): 1.87 mg/ (OECD 202); NOEC 1.15 mg/l|Algae ErC50 (72 h): Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata 0.67 mg/l (OECD 201); NOEC 0.18 mg/l|Activated sudge EC20 (3 h): &gt;100 mg/l (EEC L133)",

Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The effects of sunscreen on cutaneous synthesis of\r\nvitamin D induced by sunlight have been a subject of debate, however the newest\r\nanalysis suggests, that normal usage of sunscreen by adults do not decrease\r\ncutaneous synthesis of vitamin D . The endocrine disruptive and developmental\r\ntoxicity of many organic UV filters in experimental models is well established,\r\nthese filters seem to be associated with altered estrogen, androgen and\r\nprogesterone activity, reproductive and developmental toxicity and impaired\r\nfunctioning of the thyroid, liver or kidneys, reviewed elsewhere.\u00a0 Since many\r\nof UV filters were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the risk for\r\nneurotoxicity also occurs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Organic or chemical filters are\r\nthe most popular and widely used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.\r\nOrganic filters can be classified by the type of ultraviolet (UV) radiation\r\nthey absorb, namely UVB, UVA or UVB-UVA filters. The main route of human\r\nexposure is dermal absorption, however other routes and environmental exposure\r\nshould be also considered. The last is particularly true for organic filters,\r\nwhich, due to their high lipophilicity could bioaccumulate in aquatic organism\r\nand reach humans through the food chain. Thus, they also are emergent as an\r\nenvironmental pollutant. Chemical UV filters are easily absorbed by the skin\r\nand reach the systemic circulation, and accumulate in various tissues, as\r\nadipose tissue, liver and the brain. Their lipophilicity permits them to\r\nreadily cross the BBB. There is a wide range of in vitro and in vivo studies of\r\nthe toxic effects of UV filters as endocrine disruptors. Since it is known that\r\nother chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors can impair neuronal\r\ntransmission, synaptic plasticity and produce neurotoxic effects [ chemical\r\nfilters might potentially produce similar effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Inorganic (physical) ingredients\r\nused in modern sunscreens include metal oxide particles, typically titanium\r\ndioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), which occurs typically at 5-10%\r\nconcentration (maximum allowed is 25%). While chemical filters still dominate\r\nin sunscreen products, the usage of physical compounds is constantly growing.\r\nOne of the reasons is that they have a higher spectrum of protection - TiO2 is\r\nvery effective in absorbing UVB, while ZnO absorbs mainly the UVA range, and\r\nthe combination of both particles provides a broad UV protection. Other\r\nadvantages of physical filters are lack of skin sensitization and limited skin\r\npenetration. However, these mineral filters, when in normal pigment size range\r\n(200-400 nm for ZnO, 150-300 nm for TiO2) have poor particle dispersion, which\r\nmakes them difficult to apply; they also reflect and scatter light, which\r\nresult in undesirable visible white film on the skin. With nanotechnology,\r\nthese materials can be reduced to nanoparticles (NPs) (&lt;100 nm) which are\r\neasier to apply and are transparent on the skin . Nevertheless, with\r\nmicronization some properties are changed - they may be more bioreactive and\r\neasier penetrate the skin and other tissues, leading to concerns about their\r\nsafety use. Moreover, part of the absorbed UV radiation can generate free\r\nradicals on the surface of metal oxides in the presence of water and this\r\nphotocatalytic activity increases with decreasing NPs size. NP-induced cyto-\r\nand genotoxicity has been associated with increased photocatalytic activity,\r\nleading to increased production of free radicals</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p> <p>Benzophenones are used in medicines, UV stabilisers, aroma retention agents.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

These compounds included 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxphenol (BHA) (CAS RN: 25013-16-5), 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TBMP) (29759-28-2) and p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) (98-54-4); less active were catechol (154-23-4), p-methylphenol (331-39-5), methylhydroquinone (MHQ) (95-71-6) and pyrogallol (87-66-1), whilst no activity was seen with resorcinol (108-46-3), hydroquinone (123-31-9), propylparaben (94-13-3) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (1948-33-0).</p> <p>\u00a0In autoradiographic studies, intake of BHA, TBMP, catechol, PMOP, PTBP and MHQ resulted in a significant increase in the labelling index of the forestomach epithelium, whilst PMOP induced epithelial damage and pyloric regenerative hyperplasia. Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p>|RTECS classify BHT, an analogue of the substance, as a mutagen and tumorigen and reproductive effector. Studies with BHA, however, indicate that the substance may elicit an inhibitory effect against known carcinogens.|When administered in the diet, BHA induced papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach in rats of both sexes and male Syrian Golden hamsters. There was no evidence that BHA was carcinogenic to mice when administered topically or by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection.|Chronic exposures to dust may result in pulmonary oedema or congestion.",
