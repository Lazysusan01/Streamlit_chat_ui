Although ammonium sulfate can be created in the atmosphere from ammonia and sulfur dioxide, this process is limited by atmospheric sulfur dioxide, not by ammonia, which has many natural sources. Particulate ammonium sulfate is removed from air by wet and dry deposition. There is no evidence for photodegradation of ammonium sulfate.</p> <p>In unsterilised soil, ammonium sulfate is mineralised fairly rapidly, and subsequently nitrified. Nitrification and denitrification processes also occur naturally in streams and rivers, as well as in many secondary sewage treatment processes.</p> <p>Based on the high water solubility and the ionic nature, ammonium sulfate is not expected to adsorb or bioaccumulate to a significant extent. However, mobility in soil may be reduced through ion-ion interactions.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): Salmo gairdneri (juvenile) 173 mg/l</p> <p>Fish NOEC (61 d): Oncorhyncus gorbuscha (alevins) 11 mg/l</p> <p>Freshwater snail LC50 (24 h): Helisoma trivolysis (juvenile) 393 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna EC50 (96 h): &gt;100 mg/l</p> <p>Algae EC50 (18 d): Chlorella vulgaris 2700 mg/l (cell count)</p> <p>The PNEC for the freshwater aquatic environment is based upon the lowest observed chronic toxicity result, the NOEC value of 11 mg/l ammonium sulfate for alevins of Oncorhynchus gorbuscha. An assessment factor of 100 is appropriate, leading to a freshwater aquatic PNEC of 0.11 mg/l. Supporting information is also available for three juvenile amphibian species. The most sensitive amphibians were 6 week-old Pseudacris regilla tadpoles, with a NOEC (10 d) of 82 mg/l ammonium sulfate.</p> <p><b>Marine Environment</b></p> <p>Marine acute data are available for fish, invertebrates and for phytoplankton, the latter being most sensitive. For Gymnodinium splendens and Gonyaulax polyedra , growth reduction was found at concentrations of 0.7 mg/l and above. No EC50 can be derived. For seawater invertebrates the lowest effect value was obtained for green mussel Perna viridis (96h-LC50 = 47.7 mg/l). For marine fish the lowest effect value was found for larvae of Sciaenops ocellatus with a LC50 (10 d) of 27 mg/l.</p> <p><b>Microorganisms in sewage treatment:</b></p> <p>Nitrification during sewage treatment plant operation involves both sensitive (no growth at 4700 but growth at 94 mg/l ammonium sulfate) and insensitive (growth at 4700 mg/l ammonium sulfate) strains of Nitrobacter spp. These results indicate that a NOEC for specific nitrifying bacteria will be greater than 94 mg/l.</p> <p>In the terrestrial environment, the major effect of repeated ammonium sulfate application is a reduction in soil pH. The most toxic results for specific soil bacteria, for cyanobacteria in rice fields, show less than 50% reduction in nitrogen fixation at 330 kg/ha/yr in the absence of liming. Similar results are seen for plants, with 471 kg/ha/y for 6 years affecting drought resistance in Picea abies. The soil fauna is less sensitive, with both Collembolla and Cryptostigmata numbers increasing under 708 kg /ha/year ammonium sulfate application</p> <p>for inorganic sulfates:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Data from tap water studies with human volunteers indicate that sulfates produce a laxative effect at concentrations of 1000 - 1200 mg/litre, but no increase in diarrhoea, dehydration or weight loss. The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable taste; the lowest taste threshold concentration for sulfate is approximately 250 mg/litre as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems. No health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/litre.</p> <p>Sulfates are removed from the air by both dry and wet deposition processes. Wet deposition processes including rain-out (a process that occurs within the clouds) and washout (removal by precipitation below the clouds) contribute to the removal of sulfate from the atmosphere.</p> <p>In soil, the inorganic sulfates can adsorb to soil particles or leach into surface water and groundwater. Sulfates can be taken up by plants and be incorporated into the parenchyma of the plant.</p> <p>Sulfate in water can also be reduced by sulfate bacteria (<i>Thiobacilli</i>) which use them as a source of energy.</p> <p>In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle. Sodium sulfate is not reactive in aqueous solution at room temperature. Sodium sulfate will completely dissolve, ionise and distribute across the entire planetary \"aquasphere\". Some sulfates may eventually be deposited, the majority of sulfates participate in the sulfur cycle in which natural and industrial sodium sulfate are not distinguishable</p> <p>The BCF of sodium sulfate is very low and therefore significant bioconcentration is not expected. Sodium and sulfate ions are essential to all living organisms and their intracellular and extracellular concentrations are actively regulated. However some plants (e.g. corn and\u00a0<i>Kochia Scoparia</i>), are capable of accumulating sulfate to concentrations that are potentially toxic to ruminants.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For sulfate in general:</p> <p>Fish LC50: \u00a0toxic from 7000 mg/l</p> <p>Bacteria: toxic from \u00a02500 mg/l</p> <p>Algae were shown to be the most sensitive to sodium sulfate; EC50 120 h = 1,900 mg/l. For invertebrates\u00a0<i>(Daphnia magna)\u00a0</i>the EC50 48 h = 4,580 mg/l and fish appeared to be the least sensitive with a LC50 96h = 7,960 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>. Activated sludge showed a very low sensitivity to sodium sulfate. There was no effect up to 8 g/l. Sodium sulfate is not very toxic to terrestrial plants.\u00a0<i>Picea banksiana\u00a0</i>was the most sensitive species, an effect was seen at 1.4 g/l. Sediment dwelling organisms were not very sensitive either, with an LC50 96h = 660 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Trycorythus sp</i>. Overall it can be concluded that sodium sulfate has no acute adverse effect on aquatic and sediment dwelling organisms. Toxicity to terrestrial plants is also low.</p> <p>No data were found for long term toxicity. The acute studies all show a toxicity of sodium sulfate higher than 100 mg/l, no bioaccumulation is expected,</p> <p>In air ammonia is persistent whilst, in water, it biodegrades rapidly to nitrate, producing a high oxygen demand. Ammonia is strongly adsorbed to soil. Ammonia is non-persistent in water (half-life 2 days) and is moderately toxic to fish under normal temperature and pH conditions. Ammonia is harmful to aquatic life at low concentrations but does not concentrate in the food chain. Ammonium ions may be toxic to fish at 0.3 mg/l</p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>0.5 mg/l (UK max.)</p> <p>1.5 mg/l (WHO Levels)</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: none available.</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: none available.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <p>Experience indicates that the following polymers are suitable as glove materials for protection against undissolved, dry solids, where abrasive particles are not present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>polychloroprene. </li>\n<li>nitrile rubber. </li>\n<li>butyl rubber. </li>\n<li>fluorocaoutchouc. </li>\n<li>polyvinyl chloride. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gloves should be examined for wear and/ or degradation constantly.</p>"

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Serious poisonings are characterised by blood disorders, anaemia and nephritis.|51r22<p>The principal concern with exposure to inorganic nitrate is its biological reduction to reactive and toxic nitrite. Nitrate itself is relatively harmless. Where bacteria are present and the environment is anaerobic, nitrate can be reduced to nitrite. The main site for this reaction is mouth and stomach, but nitrite formation in the lower intestine and in the bladder (urinary infection) may also be of some toxicological importance.</p>\n<p>Adults have tolerated large doses of nitrate as sodium and ammonium salt (&gt; 100 mg NO3-/kg) in some cases repeated for several days for medical or experimental purposes with only minor effects in some subjects (light methaemoglobinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting). Death and severe effects of nitrate ingestion are generally associated with doses above 10 g NO3-. Doses between 2 and 9 g NO3- have been reported to cause methaemoglobinaemia. These values correspond to 33 to 150 mg NO3-/kg</p>\n<p>The half-life in the body for an oral dose of nitrate to be approximately 5 hours. As blood absorption depends on food matrix and route of exposure, and as larger doses may increase the urinary excretion rate, the biological half-life for both nitrate and nitrite should be expected to be 3 to 8 hours.Nitrate does not accumulate in the body.</p>\n<p>The major acute toxic effect of nitrate and nitrite poisoning is methaemoglobinaemia.</p> <p>The lethal oral dose of nitrite for adults has been variously reported to be between 0.7 and 6 g NO2- (approximately 10 to 100 mg NO2-/kg). Lower doses may apply for children (especially neonates), the elderly and people with certain enzyme deficiencies. The first symptoms of oral nitrite poisoning develop within 15 to 45 minutes</p>\n<p>In humans, inorganic nitrites produce smooth muscle relaxation, methaemoglobinaemia and cyanosis.The primary effect of nitrite intoxication in animals is methaemoglobinaemia whilst secondary effects include vasodilation, relaxation of smooth muscle and lowering of blood pressure. Other nitrite-induced toxic effects include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, atrophied intestinal villi and apoptotic cell death in the intestinal crypts. Nitrite may also cause sudden fall in blood pressure due to its vasodilating properties.Nitrite has vasodilating properties, probably through transformation into nitric oxide (NO) or a NO-containing molecule acting as a signal factor for smooth muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p>Fatal poisonings in infants, resulting from ingestion of nitrates in water or spinach, have been reported.</p>\n<p>When sodium nitrite was administered in drinking water for 6 weeks (0.06-1%), mice showed a slight degeneration and spotty necrosis of hepatocytes and haemosiderin deposition in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, indicating haemolysis. At 2%, mice died within 3 weeks. In rats, subject to the same treatment regime, abnormal blood and spleen colours, due to MHG, were seen in 0.5% and 1.0% treatment groups. Hepatic microsomal lipoperoxidation (as measured by malondialdehyde formation) was increased in male rats given 0.2% sodium nitrite in drinking water. Liver lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase aaand cathepsin) and superoxide dismutase activities were also increased. This data suggests that the nitrite stimulates generation of superoxide radicals in the liver causing damage to cellular and subcellular membranes. Decreased plasma vitamin E and greater reduced glutathione-per erythrocyte were also reported in male rats receiving sodium nitrite in drinking water.</p> <p>The substance and/or its metabolites may bind to haemoglobin inhibiting normal uptake of oxygen.

Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor.

Ammonia is strongly adsorbed to soil. Ammonia is non-persistent in water (half-life 2 days) and is moderately toxic to fish under normal temperature and pH conditions. Ammonia is harmful to aquatic life at low concentrations but does not concentrate in the food chain.

Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment. The growth of algae produces undesirable effects on the treatment of water for drinking purposes, on fisheries, and on the use of lakes for recreational purposes.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture.

Its high water solubility, low vapour pressure (solid pure urea 80 Pa at 20 C; calculated) and consequently low Henry's law constant (4.4E-8 atm m3/mol) indicate that urea will not evaporate from water to atmosphere. When released into the air, urea is expected to be readily degraded by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; half-life is expected to be less than 1 day.</p> <p>Degradation of urea to ammonia causes NH3-emissions to air. Emissions are higher in alkaline soil (pH&gt;7).</p> <p><b>Soil:</b>\u00a0When released to soil, urea will hydrolyse into ammonium in a matter of days to several weeks. According to the worldwide use pattern of urea, when 85 - 90% of urea is used as a fertilizer, the highest environmental exposure is to soil. Urea is, however, relatively leachable from the soil into surface water and groundwater because of its weak adsorption to the soil, high water solubility and low soil-water partition coefficient. This can happen especially if the soil surface is saturated with water, as might be the case after rainfall.</p> <p><b>Water:</b>\u00a0When released into water, urea material may biodegrade to a moderate extent. Urea is not expected to evaporate significantly. Urea can be leached relatively easily into the surface water and the groundwater. The concentration of urea itself, however, is not generally detected, because of its high degradation rate. Therefore usually degradation products e.g. nitrate, nitrite and ammonium can be measured.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Due to low log Pow value (- 1.59 at 20-25 C) urea is not likely to undergo bioaccumulation.. This material has an experimentally-determined bioconcentration factor (BCF) of less than 100.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:</b>\u00a0Urea is very soluble in water and degrades ultimately in the inherent biodegradability test</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Urea has generally low acute ecotoxicity to organisms. The degradation product of urea, ammonia, is known to be toxic to all vertebrates. In neutral and acidic conditions, however, ammonia exists in the form of ammonium ion.</p> <p>Of importance may be the indirect influence of urea on the environment via eutrophication and the pollution risk of urea to groundwater, when urea is used as a fertiliser and a deicer agent in airports. Ecosystems may be affected following long-term use of urea in the control of soil acidification and by ammonia emissions to air..</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",
