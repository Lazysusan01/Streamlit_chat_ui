Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH.

Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site. International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS): Environmental Health Criteria 200</p> <p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.

Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction. Copper salts often produce an itching eczema in contact with skin. This is, likely, of a non-allergic nature.</span></p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p> <p>A fire in bulk finely divided carbon may not be obviously visible unless the material is disturbed and sparks appear.

                "StorageIncompatability": "<p>For carbon powders:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid oxidising agents, reducing agents.\u00a0</li> <li>Reaction with finely divided metals, bromates, chlorates, chloramine monoxide, dichlorine oxide, iodates, metal nitrates, oxygen difluoride, peroxyformic acid, peroxyfuroic acid and trioxygen difluoride may result in an exotherm with ignition or explosion. Less active forms of carbon will ignite or explode on suitably intimate contact with oxygen, oxides, peroxides, oxosalts, halogens, interhalogens and other oxidising species.\u00a0</li> <li>Explosive reaction with ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, calcium hypochlorite and iodine pentoxide may occur following heating. Carbon may react violently with nitric acid and may be explosively reactive with nitrogen trifluoride at reduced temperatures. In the presence of nitrogen oxide, incandescence and ignition may occur. Finely divided or highly porous forms of carbon, exhibiting a high surface area to mass (up to 2000 m2/g) may function as unusually active fuels possessing both adsorptive and catalytic properties which accelerate the release of energy in the presence of oxidising substances. Dry metal-impregnated charcoal catalysts may generate sufficient static, during handling, to cause ignition.\u00a0</li> <li>Graphite in contact with liquid potassium, rubidium or caesium at 300 deg. C. produces intercalation compounds (C8M) which ignite in air and may react explosively with water. The fusion of powdered diamond and potassium hydroxide may produce explosive decomposition.\u00a0</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Activated carbon, when exposed to air, represents a potential fire hazard due to a high surface area and adsorptive capacity. Freshly prepared material may ignite spontaneously in the presence of air especially at high humidity. Spontaneous combustion in air may occur at 90-100 deg. C. The presence of moisture in air facilitates the ignition. Drying oils and oxidising oils promote spontaneous heating and ignition; contamination with these must be avoided. Unsaturated drying oils (linseed oil etc.) may ignite following adsorption owing to an enormous increase in the surface area of oil exposed to air; the rate of oxidation may also be catalysed by metallic impurities in the carbon. A similar, but slower effect occurs on fibrous materials such as cotton waste. Spontaneous heating of activated carbon is related to the composition and method of preparation of the activated carbon. Free radicals, present in charcoal, are responsible for autoignition. Self-heating and autoignition may also result from adsorption of various vapours and gases (especially oxygen). For example, activated carbon auto- ignites in flowing air at 452-518 deg. C.; when the base, triethylenediamine, is adsorbed on the carbon (5%) the autoignition temperature is reduced to 230-260 deg. C.. An exotherm is produced at 230-260 deg. C., at high flow rates of air, although ignition did not occur until 500 deg. C.. Mixtures of sodium borohydride with activated carbons, in air, promote the oxidation of sodium borohydride, producing a self-heating reaction that may result in the ignition of charcoal and in the production of hydrogen through thermal decomposition of the borohydride.\u00a0</li> </ul>",

Dermal, mucosal, or inhalation\r\nexposure can cause irritation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Inhalation of carbon black by mice,rats and monkeys caused\r\nthickened alveolar walls, increased pulmonary collagen, right atrial and\r\nventricular strain, hypertrophy of the right atrial and ventricular septum and\r\nincreased heart weights. Although carbon black itself did not cause cancer in\r\ntreated animals, carbon black containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) did\r\ncause cancer following chronic administration by all routes tested.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Epidemiological studies of workers in the carbon black\r\nproducing industries of North America and Western Europe show no significant\r\nhealth effect due to occupational exposure to carbon black. Several other\r\nstudies provide conflicting evidence. Early studies in the former USSR and\r\nEastern Europe report respiratory diseases amongst workers exposed to carbon\r\nblack, including bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema and rhinitis. These studies\r\nare of questionable validity due to inadequate study design and methodology,\r\nlack of appropriate controls for cigarette smoking and other confounding\r\nfactors such as concurrent exposure to carbon dioxide, coal oil and petroleum\r\nvapours. Moreover, review of these studies indicates that the concentrations of\r\ncarbon black were greater than current occupational standards.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black may cause adverse pulmonary changes following\r\nprolonged or repeated inhalation of the dust; these include oral mucosal\r\nlesions, bronchitis and pneumoconiosis which may lead to lung tumours.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The body of evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies\r\ncomes from two chronic inhalation studies and two intratracheal instillation\r\nstudies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in\r\nexposed animals. An inhalation study was tested on mice, but did not show\r\nsignificantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic\r\ndata comes from three different cohort studies of carbon black production\r\nworkers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000\r\nworkers in each study group, showed elevated mortality from lung cancer in the\r\ncarbon black workers. Another study of over 5,000 workers in the United States\r\ndid not show elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers.\r\nNewer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK\r\nstudy may suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However,\r\na more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis\r\nthat carbon black acts as a late-stage carcinogen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In studies employing channel and furnace black, hamsters,\r\nmice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys exposed to dusts for 7 hours/day, 5\r\ndays/week, at concentrations of 87.4 mg/m3 for channel black and 56.5 mg/m3 for\r\nfurnace black, no malignancies were observed in any of the animals. Channel\r\nblack had little if any absorbed polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (as benzene\r\nextractables) whilst furnace black had 0.28%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Several findings have strengthened the association between\r\ninflammation and cancer and between the particle surface area dose of carbon\r\nblack and other\u00a0 poorly soluble low toxicity (PSLT) particles and the pulmonary\r\ninflammation response in mice and the proinflammatory effects in lung cells in\r\nvitro. Other evidence suggests that in addition to a cancer mechanism involving\r\nindirect genotoxicity through inflammation and oxidative stress, nanoparticles\r\nmay act as direct carcinogens .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black appears to act like PSLT particles, which can\r\nelicit lung tumours in rats following prolonged exposure to sufficiently high\r\nconcentrations of particles. Particle surface area dose was found to be most\r\npredictive of pulmonary inflammation and tumour response in rats when comparing\r\nthe dose-response relationships for various types and sizes of PSLT including\r\ncarbon black. Compared to fine PSLT, much lower concentrations of ultrafine\r\nPSLT (e.g. 2.5, 6.5 or 11.5 mg/m3 carbon black and ~10 mg/m3 ultrafine titanium\r\ndioxide) were associated with impaired clearance, persistent inflammation, and\r\nmalignant lung tumours in chronic inhalation studies in rats. Most evidence\r\nsuggests that carbon black and other PSLT-elicited lung tumours occurs through\r\na secondary genotoxic mechanism, involving chronic inflammation and oxidative\r\nstress. Experimental studies have shown that when the particle lung dose\r\nreaches a sufficiently high concentration (e.g.,mass dose of ~0.5 mg fine-sized\r\nPSLT/g lung in rats), the alveolar macrophage-medicated clearance process\r\nbegins to be impaired (complete impairment occurs at ~10 mg/g lung. Overloading\r\nof lung clearance is accompanied by pulmonary inflammation, leading to\r\nincreased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, depletion of\r\nantioxidants and/or impairment of other defense mechanisms, cell injury, cell\r\nproliferation, fibrosis, and as seen in rats,\u00a0 induction of mutations and\r\neventually cancer. Rats appear to be more sensitive to carbon black and other\r\nPSLT than other rodent species. Although studies in humans have not shown a\r\ndirect link between inhaled PSLT and lung cancer, many of the steps in the\r\nmechanism observed in rats have also been observed in humans who work in dusty\r\njobs, including increased particle lung retention and pulmonary inflammation in\r\nworkers exposed to coal dust or crystalline silica and elevated lung cancer has\r\nbeen observed in some studies of workers exposed to carbon black, crystalline\r\nsilica, and diesel exhaust particles</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Monkeys exposed to channel black for 1000-1500 hours showed\r\nevidence of electrocardiac changes indicative of right atrial and right\r\nventricular strain. These changes increased progressively until after 10,000\r\nhours of exposure, when the changes were marked. The authors of this study\r\nconcluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged exposure other\r\nthan those expected from the accumulation of non-toxic dusts in the pulmonary\r\nsystem. Exposure to furnace black produced a similar picture although\r\nelectrocardiographic change was first observed in monkeys after 2500 hours'\r\nexposure and marked atrial and right ventricular strain after 10,000 hours' exposure.\r\nThe authors concluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged\r\nexposure other than those expected from the accumulation of nontoxic dusts in\r\nthe pulmonary system.

Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Copper is unlikely to accumulate in the atmosphere due to a short residence time for airborne copper aerosols. Airborne coppers, however, may be transported over large distances. Copper accumulates significantly in the food chain.</p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>3000 ug/l (UK max)</p> <p>2000 ug/l (WHO provisional Guideline)</p> <p>1000 ug/l (WHO level where individuals complain)</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: Dutch Criteria</p> <p>36 mg/kg (target)</p> <p>190 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: no data available.</p> <p>\u00a0The toxic effect of copper in the aquatic biota depends on the bio-availability of copper in water which, in turn, depends on its physico-chemical form (ie.speciation). \u00a0Bioavailability is decreased by complexation and adsorption of copper by natural organic matter, iron and manganese hydrated oxides, and chelating agents excreted by algae and other aquatic organisms. Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival. For high bioavailability waters, effect concentrations for several sensitive species may be below 10 ug Cu/litre.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In fish, the acute lethal concentration of copper ranges from a few ug/litre to several mg/litre, depending both on test species and exposure conditions. Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival. Lower effect concentrations are generally associated with test waters of high bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In summary:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Responses expected for high concentration ranges of copper *</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Total dissolved Cu concentration range (ug/litre)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Effects of high availability in water</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1-10</p>  </td> <td> <p>Significant effects are expected for diatoms and sensitive invertebrates, notably cladocerans.</p> <p>Effects on fish could be significant in freshwaters with low pH and hardness.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>10-100</p>  </td> <td> <p>Significant effects are expected on various species of microalgae, some species of macroalgae, and a range of invertebrates, including crustaceans, gastropods and sea urchins. \u00a0Survival of sensitive fish will be affected and a variety of fish show sublethal effects.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>100-1000</p>  </td> <td> <p>Most taxonomic groups of macroalgae and invertebrates will be severely affected. \u00a0Lethal levels for most fish species will be reached.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>&gt;1000</p>  </td> <td> <p>Lethal concentrations for most tolerant organisms are reached.</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* Sites chosen have moderate to high bioavailability similar to water used in most toxicity tests.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In soil, copper levels are raised by application of fertiliser, fungicides, from deposition of highway dusts and from urban, mining and industrial sources. Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction. Copper salts often produce an itching eczema in contact with skin. This is, likely, of a non-allergic nature.</span></p>",

The material is a physical irritant to the gastro-intestinal tract</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "Chronic exposure to copper dusts may result in runny nose, irritation of mucous membranes and atrophic changes with resultant dementia. Pre-existing skin, kidney, liver and pulmonary disorders may be aggravated by acute exposure.|55r33#? <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.
