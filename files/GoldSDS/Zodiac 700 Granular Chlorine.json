Aquatic chemistry is determined by aquatic factors including pH,\r\nammonium ion (which combines with chlorine to produce chloramine) and certain\r\nother reducing agents. &nbsp;Inorganic reducing agents in estuarine waters\r\ninclude sulfur, iron and manganese. Other organic compounds in water also\r\ncontribute to chlorine decay rate. The reactions of chlorine or hypochlorites\r\nin water produce a number of by-products many of which have been implicated as\r\ngenotoxic or tumourigenic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Chlorine, added to drinking water as chlorine gas (Cl2) or\r\nhypochlorite salts (e.g., NaOCl), effectively inactivates bacteria in 20\r\nminutes at concentrations of 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l at pH range of 7.0 to 8.5 and\r\ntemperature range of 4 deg.C to 22 deg.C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Chlorine disinfectants in wastewater react with organic matters,\r\ngiving rise to organic chlorine compounds such as AOX (halogenated organic\r\ncompounds absorbable on activated carbon), which are toxic for aquatic\r\norganisms and are persistent environmental contaminants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Chlorine hydrolyses very rapidly in water (rate constants range\r\nfrom 1.5 x 10-4 at deg.

Therefore the concentration of chlorine in an aqueous solution is generally expressed as free available chlorine (FAC) which is the sum of Cl2 + HOCl + ClO-, regardless whether these species stem from dissolved gaseous chlorine or from dissolved sodium/calcium hypochlorite</p> <p>Hypochlorite anion dissolved in water is brought to equilibrium between active chlorine species like chlorine (Cl2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or hypochlorite ClO-. The relative amounts of the components are dependent on ionic strength and pH. At the pH in the natural environment (6-8), HOCl or ClO is dominating (HClO: pKa = 7.53). A diluted aqueous solution of HOCl will decompose very slowly in the dark, but more rapidly in the presence of light, particularly rapidly in full sun light, by producing hydrogen chloride and oxygen. Some chlorine and chloric acid (HClO3) may also develop. The physico-chemical properties indicate that chlorine released into the environment as HClO or Cl2 is distributed into water and air. Consequently, the effects that may manifest in the natural environment are considered common to those assessed for the other source of hypochlorite.</p> <p>In the natural water, in the presence of organic or inorganic compounds, the free available chlorine immediately reacts forming various chlorinated and/or oxidized by-products e.g. chloramines or chloromethanes. They are mainly distributed to the hydrosphere, but are also able to transfer to some extent to the atmosphere depending on their intrinsic properties. A potential for bioaccumulation or bioconcentration of active chlorine species can be disregarded, because of their water solubility and their high reactivity.</p> <p>In fresh water, the hypochlorites break down rapidly into non-toxic compounds when exposed to sunlight. In seawater, chlorine levels decline rapidly; however, hypobromite (which is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms) is formed. Sodium and calcium hypochlorite are low in toxicity to avian wildlife, but they are highly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates.</p> <p>Hypochlorite is a highly reactive chemical which, during and after its use in household scenarios, undergoes a variety of reactions. The major one is the oxidation of inorganic and organic species.</p> <p>A minor reaction, which consumes about 1.5% of the chlorine atoms from hypochlorite, is chlorination, which leads to formation of organohalogen by-products that are often measured by the group parameter, AOX.</p> <p>Hypochlorite itself is rapidly broken down during use, in the sewer, and if any does reach sewage treatment it will further degrade (half-life of around 0.6 minutes). Predictions have indicated that its concentration will fall to below 1.E-32 ug/l by the end of the sewer, partially due to its reaction with ammonia in the sewer which leads to a subsequent increase in chloramine.</p> <p>The organohalogen by-products formed from the use of hypochlorite are currently receiving much attention. However, the levels of AOX produced are low (for example, 37 ug/l from bleach use compared to a sewage background level of 106 ug/l), and the organohalogens produced from domestic use of hypochlorite are not believed to have an adverse effect on the environment. Available data indicate that no dioxins are produced, and that the identified AOXs are typically small molecules with a low degree of chlorination and for which ecotoxicological properties are known or can be predicted. Where drinking water is disinfected by chlorination, the levels of organohalogens in sewage effluent arising from bleach use will be comparable with, and sometimes only a fraction of, those arising from the tap-water. After secondary sewage treatment, the levels entering receiving waters will be of the same order of magnitude as background levels typically present in rivers, though the total flux in rivers from natural sources will be much greater.</p> <p>The majority of the measured AOX is unidentified, but thought to consist of high molecular weight components formed from fats, proteins and humic acids which are too large to bioaccumulate.</p> <p>In addition, studies on the whole AOX mixture in laundry waste-water indicated that the level of AOX present did not effect growth or reproduction of\u00a0<i>Ceriodaphnia</i>, and that around 70% is removed in activated sludge.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The level of chloramine reaching surface water is estimated to be below 5.E-10 ug/l. Both these concentrations are orders of magnitude below the lowest acute EC50s determined for sodium hypochlorite (EC50 to invertebrates = 5 ug/l) and monochloramine (EC50 to invertebrates = 16 ug/l).</p> <p>Valid freshwater short-term toxicity data are available only for invertebrates: the LC50 for Ceriodaphnia dubia is 5 ug FAC/l (FAC=Free available chlorine). Adequate standard acute tests in fish are not available, but from many reliable studies performed under intermittent exposure conditions a 96h LC50 of 60 ug TRC/L and a 168 h LC50 of 330 ug TRC/L can be derived (TRC = total residual chlorine = the sum of combined and free residual available chlorine). Due to the intermittent regime (three 45 minutes pulses per day) a 96h LC50 &lt;&lt; 60 ug TRC/l can be expected for fish in a standard test. Most lowest result for algae is reported for Thalassiosira pseudonana with a IC50 of 75 ug/L (20 deg C).</p> <p>Regarding long-term toxicity to freshwater organisms, the lowest NOEC was 5 ug/L (Ictalurus punctatus, 133 d, growth). In microcosm and field studies the most sensitive parameter was the density of zooplankton with a NOEC of 1.5 ug TRC/L, and zooplankton is more sensitive to chlorine than algae.</p> <p>For salt water, valid short-term toxicity data are available for mollusks and for fish (Oncorhynchus kisutch 96 h LC50 = 32 ug TRO/L) (TRO = Total Residual Oxidant) showing comparable sensitivity. For long term toxicity the molluscs are more sensitive than fish showing a 15 d NOEC of 6.2 ug TRO/L. It is impossible to delineate representative toxicity indicator figures because of the unique feature of the chemical to be tested in standard methods. However, the accumulated scientific information covering a wide range of species, temperature,application regime or field studies can be used for the hazard assessment.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the\u00a0<b><i>Daphnia EC50 (48 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><br /></p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
