The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Analytical studies of hydrolysis products indicate that the molecule cleaves at the aromatic carbon-nitrogen bond.\u00a0</p> <p>It is difficult to define clearly the ways in which phenylenediamines are eliminated from the hydrosphere. Elimination processes such as oxidation reactions, adsorption, and stripping effects can only be conjectured. It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty for any of the three isomers what proportion of their elimination is accounted for by biodegradation. The following elimination rates have been found: between 0 and 69 % for o-phenylenediamine, between 0 and 60 % for m-phenylenediamine and between 0 and 100 % for p-phenylenediamine. It is assumed that any phenylenediamines released into the atmosphere are destroyed by photodegradation. The calculated half-life is less than 2 hours. The low POW values indicate that bioaccumulation is unlikely to occur to any significant degree. Only one study has dealt with the behaviour of phenylenediamines in soil, in respect to their soil sorption and geoaccumulation. According to this study, adsorption is relatively strong at low concentrations and expandable clay minerals</p> <p>but quite weak at higher concentrations. No information is available on the sorption behaviour against organic material.</p> <p>The substituted p-phenylenediamines and presumably the other isomers, in general, are very toxic to aquatic organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>Aromatic amines (arylamines), particularly primary aromatic amines, covalently and irreversibly bind to humic substances present in most natural waters.</p> <p>All metabolites with moieties of: anilines, benzidines and toluidines are of environmental concern. Anilines and benzidines are both acutely toxic and toxic depending on the specific aquatic species (except algae). Toluidines represent a similar concern, It has been speculated that aqueous solutions of aromatic amines can be oxidised by organic radicals, but there are no actual data on reaction rates. Based on a study of reaction rate data for these compounds an estimate of the half-life of aromatic amines in water is approximately 100 days, assuming a peroxy radical concentration of 10-10 mole/L in sunlit, oxygenated water</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The three phenylenediamine isomers have been observed to form strongly mutagenic oxidation products which influence test results.</p> <p>There are a few studies on the carcinogenic effect of m- and p-phenylenediamine using various methods of administration in which only subcutaneous injection produced localised tumours. o-Phenylenediamine, on the other hand, produced liver tumours in the rat and mouse only after oral administration. No short-term carcinogenicity studies have been carried out with o-phenylenediamine. m- and p-phenylenediamine led to cell transformations\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>;\u00a0<i>in vivo\u00a0</i>studies of tumour promotion in the liver were negative.</p> <p>o-, m- and p-Phenylenediamine do not impair fertility in spite of the fact that o-phenylenediamine was observed to have embryotoxic and sperm-damaging effects in unvalidated studies. p-Phenylenediamine is not teratogenic. Embryotoxic and slight teratogenic effects were observed with m-phenylenediamine at clearly maternotoxic doses, possibly as a result of a deficiency of nutrient supply to the fetus. No studies have been carried out on the teratogenic effect of o-phenylenediamine.</p> <p>o-, m- and p-phenylenediamine all form methaemoglobin. The highest level of methaemoglobin formation was observed with m-phenylenediamine.</p> <p>There are only isolated reports of human sensitization by o- and m-phenylenediamine.</p> <p>p-Phenylenediamine, on the other hand, is a very common allergen in man because of allergy to the para-group. Cases of photosensitisation induced by p-phenylenediamine have also been recorded.</p>",

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p><b>CARE</b>: Contamination of heated / molten liquid with water may cause violent steam explosion, with scattering of hot contents.</p>",

Anilines and benzidines are both acutely toxic and toxic depending on the specific aquatic species (except algae). Toluidines represent a similar concern, It has been speculated that aqueous solutions of aromatic amines can be oxidised by organic radicals, but there are no actual data on reaction rates.

Analytical studies of hydrolysis products indicate that the molecule cleaves at the aromatic carbon-nitrogen bond.\u00a0</p> <p>It is difficult to define clearly the ways in which phenylenediamines are eliminated from the hydrosphere. Elimination processes such as oxidation reactions, adsorption, and stripping effects can only be conjectured. It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty for any of the three isomers what proportion of their elimination is accounted for by biodegradation. The following elimination rates have been found: between 0 and 69 % for o-phenylenediamine, between 0 and 60 % for m-phenylenediamine and between 0 and 100 % for p-phenylenediamine. It is assumed that any phenylenediamines released into the atmosphere are destroyed by photodegradation. The calculated half-life is less than 2 hours. The low POW values indicate that bioaccumulation is unlikely to occur to any significant degree. Only one study has dealt with the behaviour of phenylenediamines in soil, in respect to their soil sorption and geoaccumulation. According to this study, adsorption is relatively strong at low concentrations and expandable clay minerals</p> <p>but quite weak at higher concentrations.

The three phenylenediamine isomers have been observed to form strongly mutagenic oxidation products which influence test results.</p> <p>There are a few studies on the carcinogenic effect of m- and p-phenylenediamine using various methods of administration in which only subcutaneous injection produced localised tumours. o-Phenylenediamine, on the other hand, produced liver tumours in the rat and mouse only after oral administration. No short-term carcinogenicity studies have been carried out with o-phenylenediamine. m- and p-phenylenediamine led to cell transformations\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>;\u00a0<i>in vivo\u00a0</i>studies of tumour promotion in the liver were negative.</p> <p>o-, m- and p-Phenylenediamine do not impair fertility in spite of the fact that o-phenylenediamine was observed to have embryotoxic and sperm-damaging effects in unvalidated studies. p-Phenylenediamine is not teratogenic. Embryotoxic and slight teratogenic effects were observed with m-phenylenediamine at clearly maternotoxic doses, possibly as a result of a deficiency of nutrient supply to the fetus. No studies have been carried out on the teratogenic effect of o-phenylenediamine.</p> <p>o-, m- and p-phenylenediamine all form methaemoglobin. The highest level of methaemoglobin formation was observed with m-phenylenediamine.</p> <p>There are only isolated reports of human sensitization by o- and m-phenylenediamine.</p> <p>p-Phenylenediamine, on the other hand, is a very common allergen in man because of allergy to the para-group. Cases of photosensitisation induced by p-phenylenediamine have also been recorded.</p> <p>Molten material is capable of causing burns.\u00a0</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

This condition, known as \"methaemoglobinemia\", is a form of oxygen starvation (anoxia).</p> <p>\u00a0Symptoms include cyanosis (a bluish discolouration skin and mucous membranes) and breathing difficulties. Symptoms may not be evident until several hours after exposure.</p> <p>\u00a0At about 15% concentration of blood methaemoglobin there is observable cyanosis of the lips, nose and earlobes. Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor. Above 60% symptoms include dyspnea, respiratory depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, and convulsions. Levels exceeding 70% may be fatal.\u00a0</p> <p>Systemic effects of p-phenylenediamine include asthma, gastritis (regardless of portal of entry), rises in blood pressure, transudation in serous cavities, vertigo, tremors, convulsions, and coma. Single oral doses of p-phenylenediamine can produce kidney failure. One reported case(1) study cites the development of optic atrophy with resultant blindness which persisted in a follow-up 6 months later. The dose was estimated to be 7 gm. The patient was acutely asphyxiated with a swollen oedematous face and neck and his eyes protruded (exophthalmos). Symptoms had resolved within three days after extensive steroid treatment but optic atrophy remained.</p> <p>Yagi H., et al: Human and Experimental Toxicology, 1996, 15, 617-618</p> <p>Single oral doses cause oedema of the head in animals (especially in rabbits) and damage muscle fibres in rats.</p> <p>Methaemoglobin formation has been seen only in rats.</p> <p>Rhabdomyolysis (muscle disintegration with excretion of myoglobin in the blood) is the principal mechanism underlying p-phenylenediamine systemic toxicity. It is particularly responsible for renal failure.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs.

Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Phenols may exhibit local anaesthetic properties and, in general, are central nervous system depressants at high concentrations. The dihydroxy derivatives act as simple phenols but their effects are largely limited to local irritation. Trihydroxy derivatives may reduce the oxygen content of blood at sufficient exposure levels. Methyl phenols (cresols) typically do not pose significant inhalation hazards due to relatively low vapour pressures and objectionable odours. Substituted phenols produce similar effects to phenol although such effects may only be evident at high levels of exposure. Alkyl substitution tends to increase toxicity.</p>",

Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor. Above 60% symptoms include dyspnea, respiratory depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, and convulsions.

Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",

Repeated inhalation may aggravate asthma and inflammatory or fibrotic pulmonary disease.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Results of repeated exposure tests with diethanolamine (DEA) in laboratory animals include anaemia (rats) and effects on the kidneys (rats and mice) and liver (mice). DEA produces nervous system injury in dogs and rats. Heart and salivary gland lesions have also been seen in mice treated cutaneously with DEA and in mice receiving DEA in drinking water. Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids. They are excreted predominantly unchanged with a half-life of approximately one week. In the absence of sodium nitrite, no conversion to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines was observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Diethanolamine competitively inhibits the cellular uptake of choline, in vitro, and hepatic changes in choline homeostasis, consistent with choline deficiency, are observed in vivo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Many amines are potent skin and respiratory sensitisers and certain individuals especially those described as \"atopic\" (i.e. those predisposed to asthma and other allergic responses) may show allergic reactions when chronically exposed to alkanolamines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In a study with coconut diethanolamide, the National Toxicology Program (Technical Report Series 479), showed clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic and renal tubule neoplasms and in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis in males and females, ulcer in males, and parakeratosis and inflammation in females at the site of application and of follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland of males and females, were chemical related.</p>",
