These synthetic substances include hydrocarbons that are partially fluorinated (HCFs) or totally fluorinated (PFCs) as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).</p> <p>The greenhouse potential of these substances, expressed as multiples of that of CO2, are within the range of 140 to 11,700 for HFCs, from 6500 to 9,200 for PFCs and 23,900 for SF6. Once emitted into the atmosphere, these substances have an impact on the environment for decades, centuries, or in certain instances, for thousands of years.</p> <p>Many of these substances have only been commercialised for a few years, and still only contribute only a small percentage of those gases released to the atmosphere by humans (anthropogenic) which increase the greenhouse effect.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>May act as a simple asphyxiants; these are gases which, when present in high concentrations, reduce the oxygen content in air below that required to support breathing, consciousness and life; loss of consciousness, with death by suffocation may rapidly occur in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.</p> <p><b>CARE</b>: Most simple asphyxiants are odourless or possess low odour and there is no warning on entry into an oxygen deficient atmosphere. If there is any doubt, oxygen content can be checked simply and quickly. It may not be appropriate to only recommend an exposure standard for simple asphyxiants rather it is essential that sufficient oxygen be maintained. Air normally has 21 percent oxygen by volume, with 18 percent regarded as minimum under normal atmospheric pressure to maintain consciousness / life. At pressures significantly higher or lower than normal atmospheric pressure, expert guidance should be sought.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Acute intoxication by halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons appears to take place over two stages. Signs of a reversible narcosis are evident in the first stage and in the second stage signs of injury to organs may become evident, a single organ alone is (almost) never involved.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Depression of the central nervous system is the most outstanding effect of most halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Inebriation and excitation, passing into narcosis, is a typical reaction. In severe acute exposures there is always a danger of death from respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to a tendency to make the heart more susceptible to catecholamines (adrenalin)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>Symptoms of asphyxia (suffocation) may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and ringing in the ears. If the asphyxia is allowed to progress, there may be nausea and vomiting, further physical weakness and unconsciousness and, finally, convulsions, coma and death. Significant concentrations of the non-toxic gas reduce the oxygen level in the air. As the amount of oxygen is reduced from 21 to 14 volume %, the pulse rate accelerates and the rate and volume of breathing increase. The ability to maintain attention and think clearly is diminished and muscular coordination is somewhat disturbed. As oxygen decreases from 14-10% judgement becomes faulty; severe injuries may cause no pain. Muscular exertion leads to rapid fatigue. Further reduction to 6% may produce nausea and vomiting and the ability to move may be lost. Permanent brain damage may result even after resuscitation at exposures to this lower oxygen level. Below 6% breathing is in gasps and convulsions may occur. Inhalation of a mixture containing no oxygen may result in unconsciousness from the first breath and death will follow in a few minutes.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing. Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Exposure to high concentrations of fluorocarbons may produce cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due sensitisation of the heart to adrenalin or noradrenalin. Deaths associated with exposures to fluorocarbons (specifically halogenated aliphatics) have occurred in occupational settings and in inhalation of bronchodilator drugs.</p> <p>Bronchospasm consistently occurs in human subjects inhaling fluorocarbons. At a measured concentration of 1700 ppm of one of the commercially available aerosols there is a biphasic change in ventilatory capacity, the first reduction occurring within a few minutes and the second delayed up to 30 minutes. Most subjects developed bradycardia (reduced pulse rate).</p> <p>Bradycardia is encountered in dogs when administration is limited to upper respiratory tract (oropharyngeal and nasal areas). Cardiac arrhythmias can be experimentally induced in animals (species dependency is pronounced with dogs and monkeys requiring lesser amounts of fluorocarbon FC-11 than rats or mice). Sensitivity is increased by injection of adrenalin or cardiac ischaemia/necrosis or pulmonary thrombosis/bronchitis. The cardiotoxic effects of the fluorocarbons originate from irritation of the respiratory tract which in turn reflexively influences the heart rate (even prior to absorption of the fluorocarbon) followed by direct depression of the heart after absorption.</p> <p>Exposure to fluorocarbon thermal decomposition products may produce flu-like symptoms including chills, fever, weakness, muscular aches, headache, chest discomfort, sore throat and dry cough. Complete recovery usually occurs within 24 hours of exposure.</p>|When rats were exposed to vapour concentrations of 315000 ppm they showed lethargy and temporary loss of mobility. Cardiac sensitisation was seen in one of twelve dogs exposed to 250000 ppm. Guinea pigs exposed to 75000 ppm showed pathological changes in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen.",

                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In common with other halogenated aliphatics, fluorocarbons may cause dermal problems due to a tendency to remove natural oils from the skin causing irritation and the development of dry, sensitive skin. They do not appear to be appreciably absorbed.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It is generally accepted that the fluorocarbons are less toxic than the corresponding halogenated aliphatic based on chlorine. Repeated inhalation exposure to the fluorocarbon FC-11 does not produce pathologic lesions of the liver and other visceral organs in experimental animals. There has been conjecture in non-scientific publications that fluorocarbons may cause leukemia, cancer, sterility and birth defects; these have not been verified by current research. The high incidence of cancer, spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies amongst hospital personnel, repeatedly exposed to fluorine-containing general anaesthetics, has caused some scientists to call for a lowering of the fluorocarbon exposure standard to 5 ppm since some are mutagens.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>May act as a simple asphyxiants; these are gases which, when present in high concentrations, reduce the oxygen content in air below that required to support breathing, consciousness and life; loss of consciousness, with death by suffocation may rapidly occur in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.</p> <p><b>CARE</b>: Most simple asphyxiants are odourless or possess low odour and there is no warning on entry into an oxygen deficient atmosphere. If there is any doubt, oxygen content can be checked simply and quickly. It may not be appropriate to only recommend an exposure standard for simple asphyxiants rather it is essential that sufficient oxygen be maintained. Air normally has 21 percent oxygen by volume, with 18 percent regarded as minimum under normal atmospheric pressure to maintain consciousness / life. At pressures significantly higher or lower than normal atmospheric pressure, expert guidance should be sought.</p> #CEL TWA: 1000 ppm, 4240 mg/m3 [DuPont]",

The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <ul> <li>Areas where cylinders are stored require good ventilation and, if enclosed, need discrete/controlled exhaust ventilation.\u00a0</li> <li>Secondary containment and exhaust gas treatment may be required by certain jurisdictions.\u00a0</li> <li>Local exhaust ventilation may be required in work areas.\u00a0</li> <li>Consideration should be given to the use of diaphragm or bellows-sealed, soft-seat valves; backflow prevention devices and flow-monitoring or limiting devices.\u00a0</li> <li>Automated alerting systems with automatic shutdown of gas-flow may be appropriate and may in fact be mandatory in certain jurisdictions.\u00a0</li> <li>Respiratory protection in the form of air-supplied or self-contained breathing equipment must be worn if the oxygen concentration in the workplace air is less than 19%.\u00a0</li> <li>Cartridge respirators do NOT give protection and may result in rapid suffocation.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>\u00a0Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>\u00a0Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>Symptoms of asphyxia (suffocation) may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and ringing in the ears. If the asphyxia is allowed to progress, there may be nausea and vomiting, further physical weakness and unconsciousness and, finally, convulsions, coma and death. Significant concentrations of the non-toxic gas reduce the oxygen level in the air. As the amount of oxygen is reduced from 21 to 14 volume %, the pulse rate accelerates and the rate and volume of breathing increase. The ability to maintain attention and think clearly is diminished and muscular coordination is somewhat disturbed. As oxygen decreases from 14-10% judgement becomes faulty; severe injuries may cause no pain. Muscular exertion leads to rapid fatigue. Further reduction to 6% may produce nausea and vomiting and the ability to move may be lost. Permanent brain damage may result even after resuscitation at exposures to this lower oxygen level. Below 6% breathing is in gasps and convulsions may occur. Inhalation of a mixture containing no oxygen may result in unconsciousness from the first breath and death will follow in a few minutes.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing. Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Exposure to high concentrations of fluorocarbons may produce cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due sensitisation of the heart to adrenalin or noradrenalin. Deaths associated with exposures to fluorocarbons (specifically halogenated aliphatics) have occurred in occupational settings and in inhalation of bronchodilator drugs.</p> <p>Bronchospasm consistently occurs in human subjects inhaling fluorocarbons. At a measured concentration of 1700 ppm of one of the commercially available aerosols there is a biphasic change in ventilatory capacity, the first reduction occurring within a few minutes and the second delayed up to 30 minutes. Most subjects developed bradycardia (reduced pulse rate).</p> <p>Bradycardia is encountered in dogs when administration is limited to upper respiratory tract (oropharyngeal and nasal areas). Cardiac arrhythmias can be experimentally induced in animals (species dependency is pronounced with dogs and monkeys requiring lesser amounts of fluorocarbon FC-11 than rats or mice). Sensitivity is increased by injection of adrenalin or cardiac ischaemia/necrosis or pulmonary thrombosis/bronchitis. The cardiotoxic effects of the fluorocarbons originate from irritation of the respiratory tract which in turn reflexively influences the heart rate (even prior to absorption of the fluorocarbon) followed by direct depression of the heart after absorption.</p> <p>Exposure to fluorocarbon thermal decomposition products may produce flu-like symptoms including chills, fever, weakness, muscular aches, headache, chest discomfort, sore throat and dry cough. Complete recovery usually occurs within 24 hours of exposure.</p> <p>Acute intoxication by halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons appears to take place over two stages. Signs of a reversible narcosis are evident in the first stage and in the second stage signs of injury to organs may become evident, a single organ alone is (almost) never involved.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p><br /></p> <p>Although the material is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may produce transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn).</p> <p>Direct contact with the eye may not cause irritation because of the extreme volatility of the gas; however concentrated atmospheres may produce irritation after brief exposures..</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In common with other halogenated aliphatics, fluorocarbons may cause dermal problems due to a tendency to remove natural oils from the skin causing irritation and the development of dry, sensitive skin. They do not appear to be appreciably absorbed.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Vapourising liquid causes rapid cooling and contact may cause cold burns, frostbite, even through normal gloves. Frozen skin tissues are painless and appear waxy and yellow. \u00a0Signs and symptoms of frost-bite may include \"pins and needles\", paleness followed by numbness, a hardening an stiffening of the skin, a progression of colour changes in the affected area, (first white, then mottled and blue and eventually black; on recovery, red, hot, painful and blistered).</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Not normally a hazard due to physical form of product.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments\u00a0</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>It is generally accepted that the fluorocarbons are less toxic than the corresponding halogenated aliphatic based on chlorine. Repeated inhalation exposure to the fluorocarbon FC-11 does not produce pathologic lesions of the liver and other visceral organs in experimental animals. There has been conjecture in non-scientific publications that fluorocarbons may cause leukemia, cancer, sterility and birth defects; these have not been verified by current research. The high incidence of cancer, spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies amongst hospital personnel, repeatedly exposed to fluorine-containing general anaesthetics, has caused some scientists to call for a lowering of the fluorocarbon exposure standard to 5 ppm since some are mutagens.</p>",
