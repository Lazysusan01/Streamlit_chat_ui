Within each subcategory the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter ion may also influence the physico-chemical behaviour of these chemicals, the chemical reactivity and classification for the purpose of this assessment is not expected to be affected by the difference in counter ion.</p> <p>As ionic substances, all members of this category have extremely low vapor pressures. Calculated values are in the ranges 10-11 to 10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkyl sulfates), 4.3.10-11 to 9.10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkane sulfonates), 2.1.10-13 to 6.9.10-15 hPa (C14-18 alkene sulfonates) and 3.3.10-17 to 5.8.10-19 hPa (C14-18 hydroxy alkane sulfonates). Therefore, they decompose before reaching their theoretical boiling points.</p> <p>Measured water solubilities are available only for alkyl sulfates; they are in the range 196 000 mg/l (C12) to 300 mg/l (C16) and by factors of 50 to 300 higher than calculated values (C12: 617 mg/l, C16: 5 mg/l).</p> <p>As surfactants have a tendency to concentrate at hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundaries rather than to equilibrate between phases log Kow is not a good descriptor of surfactant hydrophobicity and only of limited predictive value for the partitioning of these compounds in the environment.</p> <p>All calculated physico-chemical properties of surfactants should be treated with caution, because the estimation models do not take into account surfactant properties. In addition, the results are doubtful for ionic substances.</p> <p>Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties the target compartment for the substances of this category is the hydrosphere. Based on the ionic structure partitioning into the atmosphere can be excluded. In water, the compounds are stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions.</p> <p>Taking into account the low BCF factors (&lt;73) that were determined for (up to) C16-alkyl sulfates, any significant bioaccumulation is not expected.</p> <p>Soil sorption increases with chain length. Strong sorption on soils would be expected for chain length C14 upwards. Sediment concentrations were between 0.0035 and 0.021 mg/kg dw indicating that accumulation in sediments is low. Under certain conditions of reduced moisture in soil, i.e. in arid or semi-arid regions, accumulation in soil cannot be excluded.</p> <p>The substances of this category are readily biodegradable. Significant biodegradation of alkyl sulfates in the raw sewage, i.e. in the sewer system before reaching the (waste-water treatment plant (WWTPs) is very likely. The substances of this category are quantitatively removed in WWTPs, mainly by biodegradation. Because of the anaerobic degradation of alkyl sulfates in sewage sludge, exposure of agricultural soils due to application of sludge as fertiliser is not expected. However, for alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates this exposure pathway cannot be excluded due to their recalcitrant or limited anaerobic degradability.</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions is anticipated to follow the same pathway as for the aerobic degradation.</p> <p>Primary and secondary AS generally undergo complete primary biodegradation within a few days followed by a rapid ultimate biodegradation. Branched AS are also degraded quite rapidly, but multiple branchings of the alkyl chain considerably reduce the rate and extent of primary biodegradation. There are numerous studies confirming the aerobic biodegradability of AS, and linear primary AS exceeds all other anionic surfactants in the rate of primary and ultimate biodegradation. Also secondary AS are normally readily biodegradable as, e.g., the oxygen uptake from biodegradation of a linear secondary C10-13 AS corresponded to 77% ThOD in 22 days. Some highly branched AS being poorly primary biodegradable may also resist ultimate biodegradation.</p> <p>Both linear and 2-alkyl-branched primary AS are degraded to a high extent under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>AS are generally considered to have a low potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:\u00a0</b>Alkane sulfonate anionics (SAS) undergo rapid primary biodegradation with Methylene Blue Active Substance (MBAS) removal higher than 90% within a few days. Removal of 96% were seen in the OECD screening test for primary biodegradation. In activated sludge simulation tests, 96% of C10-18 SAS was removed, while the parent C13-18 SAS was removed by 83-96%.</p> <p>Alkyl sulfonates are not degraded under anoxic conditions</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates:\u00a0</b>alpha-Olefine sulfonates (AOS) AOS undergo rapid primary biodegradability with methylene blue active substances ( MBAS) removal between 95 and 100% in 2 to 8 days in river water and inoculated media. The ultimate biodegradability of AOS exceeds the pass requirements in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability. \u00a0report 85% DOC removal in the modified OECD screening test, 85% ThOD in the closed bottle test, and 65-80% ThCO2 in the Sturm test. In activated sludge simulation tests, AOS was removed by 100% MBAS and 88% DOC. The alkene sulfonates and hydroxyalkane sulfonates in commercial AOS are both ultimately biodegraded as approximately 84% ThCO2 was obtained during degradation of C14, C16, and C18 within 27 days, whereas the corresponding 3-hydroxyalkane sulfonates were degraded by approximately 86% under the same conditions.</p> <p>AOS are not readily degradable under anaerobic conditions Reports indicate a range of 31% to 43% MBAS removal under anoxic conditions indicating primary biodegradation</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity is influenced by a number of parameters, the length of the alkyl chain being most important. The pH and temperature of water bodies can affect the EC/LC50 values for compounds that contain ammonium ions.</p> <p>The most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates were invertebrates, followed by fish. Algae proved to be less sensitive. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (NOEC = 0.045 mg/l).</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow - fry 10.2 mg/l; juvenile 17 mg/l; adult 22.5 mg/l; rainbow trout 4.6 mg/l (static)</p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of AS seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length. This has been shown for daphnids and for some fish species. An overall comparison of the acute toxicity between the primary and secondary AS shows only minor differences in the toxicity, although only a few studies for comparison are available.</p> <p>The available data describing the toxicity of AS towards algae indicate that the lowest EC50 values range between 1 and 10 mg/l for C12 AS</p> <p>The toxicity of AS towards invertebrates has mainly been examined in tests with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity of AS to Daphnia magna increased with increasing alkyl chain length. It has been shown that during degradation of C12 AS, the toxicity first increased to a maximum after 30 hours and then fell to almost a negligible value. The increase in toxicity was explained by the formation of the more toxic dodecanoic acid which is rapidly transformed to other and less toxic metabolites.</p> <p>Studies showed that the 24 h-LC50 values for killifish in distilled water decreased by a factor of about 10 when the alkyl chain was increased by two carbon atoms. C16 was 10 times more toxic than C14, which was about 10 times more toxic than C12 AS.</p> <p>The toxicity of AS to fish has been demonstrated to increase with increasing alkyl chain length as also seen in studies with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity on Daphnia magna has been determined for chain length C8-C14. Results were comparable to alkyl sulfates in the range between C8 and C10, while C12 and C14 are significantly less toxic. Chronic data obtained for C12 alkane sulfonate sodium and C12-alkyl sulfate sodium with the rotifer\u00a0<i>Brachionus calicyflorus</i>\u00a0similarly show that alkane sulfonates might be less toxic than alkyl sulfates. C16 and C18 alkane sulfonates are assumed to exhibit the same toxicity than alkyl sulfates of comparable chain lengths. No data are available concerning the toxicity of alkane sulfonates on fish and algae. However, a similar toxicity might be assumed because of structural and physico-chemical similarities between the three subcategories</p> <p>Whereas most correlations between AS structure and toxicity show an increasing toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length, the budding in Hydra attenuata was apparently more affected by C10 AS than by C12, C14, and C16 AS. The authors suggested that the decrease in toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length was attributable to reduced solubility in water</p> <p>Tests on the toxicity to microorganisms were only conducted with alkyl sulfates as test substances. A test on the inhibition of respiration of activated sludge resulted in an 3 h-EC50 of 135 mg/l (nominally). The lowest effect value for protozoa was obtained from a test on\u00a0<i>Uronema parduczi</i>\u00a0using C12-alkyl sulfate sodium - \u00a0the 20 h-EC5 was 0.75 mg/l.</p> <p>Experimental test results on benthic organisms in a water-sediment system are not available. However, due to sediment-water partitioning coefficients Kd &lt; 350, no significant risk for organisms in this compartment is to be expected.</p> <p>Data indicate that toxic effects on soil organisms might only be expected at high concentrations for alkyl sulfates. Toxicity of alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates can not be assessed because test results for terrestrial organisms are not available.</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates,</b>\u00a0reliable short-term tests on fish, invertebrates and algae are available. The results indicate that toxicity is increasing as the alkyl chain length increases. The lowest available effect value is the 96 h-LC50 = 0.5 mg/l, determined in tests on\u00a0<i>Oryzias latipes, Rasbora heteromorpha</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Salmo trutta</i></p> <p>Algae show toxic effects to growth when exposed 10-100 mg/l for C14-18 AOS.</p> <p>EC50 values for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>\u00a0have been determined within the range 5-50 mg/l for C14-18 AOS . Another study with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>, showed EC50 values of 16.6 mg/l for C14-16 AOS and 7.7 mg/l for C16-18 AOS.</p> <p>Studies performed with fish show that the higher homologues of AOS are more toxic than the lower ones. This has been illustrated for different fish species (LC50 (96 h) range 0.5-5.3 mg/l)</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:</b>\u00a0The toxicity of various SAS homologues was determined in tests with\u00a0<i>Chlamydomonas variabilis</i><b><i>.</i></b>\u00a0After 24 hours of exposure at 20 C, there was a tendency to an increased toxicity with increasing chain length. The EC50 values were 125 mg/l for C10.3, 74.9 mg/l for C11.2, 32.4 mg/l for C14, 15.8 mg/l for C15, 9.42 mg/l for C16, 3.93 mg/l for C17, 3.71 mg/l for C18.9, and 8.47 mg/l for C20.7.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>SIDS Initial Assessment Profile</p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

There\r\nare four major fatty acid alkanolamides (also known as alkylolamides).\r\nmonoethanolamide (MEA); diethanolamide (DEA); monoisopropanolamide (MIPA) and\r\nethoxylated or PEG alkanolamides. Each group has its own specific functions and\r\nuses in various formulations. In forming the alkanolamide an alkanolamine soap\r\nis first formed and then dehydrated to form the alkanolamide. At the same time\r\nsignificant quantities of amine esters and amide esters are formed by side\r\nreactions. If a dialkanolamide is used as the starting material, smaller\r\namounts of amine diester and amide diester are formed as well as some\r\nmorpholine and piperazine derivatives</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One of the unique properties of\r\nthe alkylolamides is their ability to thicken aqueous solutions. water-insoluble;\r\nproducts such as lauric monoethanolamide also make excellent thickeners.

FAA consist of a fatty acid, usually derived from coconut oil, which is linked to an amide group by a C-N bond. The amide may be typically either be monoethanolamide (MEA), diethanolamide (DEA), or monoisopropanolamide (MIPA).</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Most fatty acid amides (FAA), such as the widely used cocodiethanolamide (cocoamide DEA) and cocomonoethanolamide (cocoamide MEA), are ultimately degraded in the OECD tests for ready biodegradability under aerobic conditions. The available data describing the aerobic biodegradability of the ethoxylated FAA are contradictory. Certain data indicates that these surfactants do not pass the criteria for ready biodegradability, whereas the opposite is the case for data obtained from Akzo Nobel</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The anaerobic biodegradability of FAA has been examined for cocoamide MEA by using the ECETOC screening test. Ultimate anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamide MEA reached 79% of the theoretical gas production, ThGP, during incubation of diluted digested sludge for 42 days at 35 degree C . By use of the ISO 11734 screening test, which corresponds to the ECETOC method, the ultimate anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamide MEA attained 81% during 56 days</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0No experimental data describing the bioaccumulation potential of fatty acid amides were found in the literature</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The aquatic toxicity of FAA has been determined for species representing the three trophic levels algae, invertebrates, and fish. Cocoamide DEA appears to be more toxic to aquatic organism than cocoamide MEA.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An exceptionally high toxicity of cocoamide MEA was reported for two tests with the green alga\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus\u00a0</i>as the 96 h-EC50 were 1.0 and 1.1 mg/l \u00a0More recent tests with a pure cocoamide ME - purity about 95.5% C12-18 gave EC50 values of 16.6 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus</i>\u00a0and 17.8 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata</i>\u00a0(formerly\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornutum</i>) .

Many of the\r\nECOSAR model estimates for the acute toxicity endpoints indicate the chemicals\r\nare \u201cnot toxic at solubility\u201d. However, for surfactants such as the FND Amides\r\nthe acute aquatic toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects\r\nof the surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical\r\ntoxicity.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids.

There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application.
