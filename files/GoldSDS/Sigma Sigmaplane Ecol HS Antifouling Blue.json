This macrocyclic structure like porphyrins(biopigments) is highly coloured Phthalocyanine derivatives derived from the basic compound of (C6H4C2N)4N4 are used as light-fast blue or green pigments. The hosted metals and substituted groups result in distinct colors; phthalocyanine (blue-green), copper phthalocyanine (blue), chlorinated copper phthalocyanine (green), and sulfonated copper phthalocyanine (green). They have also been involved in the study of photosensitizer chemistry or metal complex chemistry such as transition-metal complex catalyst chemistry for uniform polymerization, luminescence chemistry and spectrophotometric analysis, organic synthesis and polymerization. Phthalocyanine pigments are used in enamels, linoleum, inks, plastics, and rubber goods. Photoisomerizable phthalocyanines are used in rewritable CD or DVD printing. Some phthalocyanines such as fluoraluminium phthalocyanine are used in cancer treatment.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Due to\u00a0<i>pi</i>-electron cloud overlaps, phthalocyanines exhibit semiconductor property. Organic semiconductors have some merits of self radiation, flexibility, light weight, easy fabrication, and low cost. They have been investigated as organic electroluminescence materials for the applications in organic solar cells, biosensitizers and display devices such as OLED(Organic Light Emitting Diode), OTFT(Organic Thin Film Transistor), Wearable Display, and e-paper.</p>|Used in oil, inks, emulsion paint, plastics, paper, chalks and pencils. Used in organic solar cell research.  In the development of quantum computing due to the length of time its electrons can exist in a state of quantum superposition. CuPc can be easily processed into a thin film for use in device fabrication, which makes it an attractive qubit candidate",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

Animal studies, in part, appear to support this proposition</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Phthalocyanine dyes are probably not biodegradable. Reversible reduction and decolourisation occurs under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>Many dyes are visible in water at concentrations as low as 1 mg/l Textile-processing waste waters, typically with a dye content in the range 10- 200 mg /l are therefore usually highly coloured and discharge in open waters presents an aesthetic problem. As dyes are designed to be chemically and photolytically stable, they are highly persistent in natural environments. The release of dyes may therefore present an ecotoxic hazard and introduces the potential danger of bioaccumulation that may eventually affect man by transport through the food chain.</p> <p>Algae are generally susceptible to dyes, but the inhibitory effect is thought to be related to light inhibition at high dye concentrations, rather than a direct inhibitory effect of the dyes. This effect may account for up to 50% of the inhibition observed.</p> <p>Virtually all dyes from all chemically distinct groups are prone to fungal oxidation but there are large differences between fungal species with respect to their catalysing power and dye selectivity. A clear relationship between dye structure and fungal dye biodegradability has not been established. Fungal degradation of aromatic structures is a secondary metabolic event that starts when nutrients (C, N and S) become limiting. Therefore, while the enzymes are optimally expressed under starving conditions, supplementation of energy substrates and nutrients are necessary for propagation of the cultures.</p> <p>The effects of the substitutional pattern of the dyes are inconclusive, but it has been suggested that introduction of the functional groups; methyl, nitro, sulfo or acid, weakens the inhibition of bacteria, whereas introduction of chlorine and bromine strengthens the inhibition</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Symptoms may be delayed for up to 12 hours and begin with the sudden onset of thirst, and a sweet, metallic or foul taste in the mouth. Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Exposure to copper, by skin, has come from its use in pigments, ointments, ornaments, jewellery, dental amalgams and IUDs and as an antifungal agent and an algicide. Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction. Copper salts often produce an itching eczema in contact with skin. This is, likely, of a non-allergic nature.</span></p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p> <p>Because of similarities in structure to thalidomide, concerns have been raised about the potential teratogenicity of all phthalimides (the basic building block of phthalocyanine). Animal studies, in part, appear to support this proposition.</p>\n<p>The phthalimide fungicides are typically teratogens. Captan, for example, is teratogenic, foetotoxic, and/or embryotoxic in a variety of rodent species and has caused stillbirths in dogs. Folpet was teratogenic in</p>\n<p>rabbits, chicks, and hamsters. Captafol has been embryo-or foetotoxic in experimental animals.Captan, folpet, and captafol have all induced testicular degeneration in laboratory animals.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Resin acids are diterpenenes of the abietic acid type and the pimaric acid type. Abietic acid had conjugated double links and pimaric acid non-conjugated double links. Abietic acid oxidises more easily than pimaric acid. The proportion of each acid varies above all according to the method of production, but also with the type of wood, growth site, handling and storage. Tall oil rosin contains a smaller amount of acids of the abietic acid type but more dehydroabietic acid than \"gum rosin\". The neutral substances making up about 10% of the colophony are at least 80 in number. The neutral substances in tall oil rosin are dominated by fatty acid esters and hydrocarbons formed from sterols. The neutral substances in \"gum rosin\" are diterpene aldehydes and alcohols with the same carbon skeletons as the acids. Oxidation makes colophony more brittle and darker.|Colophony is a relatively cheap chemical and is used in many connections where its adhesive property is desirable. It can be used in solid form or as a solution. The biggest applications are as a paper chemical and in paint, varnish and adhesive. In paper, colophony can increase wet strength. In paint, varnish and adhesive, colophony or colophony derivates are used as binders. Printing ink, for example, can include binders of this kind. Colophony is used as a tackifier and plasticiser in rubber. It can also be found in products which are used to increase friction, for example in anti-slip agents for floors or for easier gripping. The resin used for violin bows is pure colophony|Rosin-colophony (isopimaric acid) is a BK Channel activator which improves cognitve effects in Alaheimer disease animal models.|<p><span style=\"color:black\">An abietane derivative (a\r\npodocarpane derivative).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Abietane is a diterpene that\r\nforms the structural basis for a variety of natural chemical compounds such as\r\nabietic acid, carnosic acid, and ferruginol which are collectively known as\r\nabietanes or abietane diterpenes. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Naturally occurring aromatic\r\nabietane diterpenoids (dehydroabietanes) are tricyclic compounds which exhibit\r\na wide range of biological activities.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>acrolein\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

Typical rosin is a transparent or translucent\r\nmass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown colour,\r\nnon-odorous or having only a slight turpentine odor and taste. Rosin is\r\ninsoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether and hot\r\nfatty oils, and softens and melts under the influence of heat, and burns with a\r\nbright but smoky flame.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Solid resins are delivered as\r\nprills, flakes, pellets, or in drums (cast solid).They are brittle materials\r\nprone to create dust during handling.

This may lead\r\nto violent explosions if ignited</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Rosin consists of a complex\r\nmixture of different substances including organic acids named the resin acids.\r\nThese are closely related to the terpenes, and derive from them through partial\r\noxidation. Resin acids can be dissolved in alkalis to form resin soaps, from\r\nwhich the purified resin acids are regenerated by treatment with acids</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Resin acid refers to mixtures of\r\nseveral related carboxylic acids, primarily abietic-type\u00a0 and pimaric-type\r\nacids, found in tree resins. Nearly all resin acids have the same basic\r\nskeleton: three fused rings having the empirical formula C19H29COOH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The structure of abietic\r\ncompounds differ only in the position of the conjugated double bond system.\r\nThis feature influences their chemical reactivity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Resin acids are tacky, yellowish\r\ngums that are water-insoluble. They are used to produce soaps for diverse\r\napplications, but their use is being displaced increasingly by synthetic acids\r\nsuch as 2-ethylhexanoic acid or petroleum-derived naphthenic acids. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Resin acids are protectants and\r\nwood preservatives that are produced by parenchymatous epithelial cells that\r\nsurround the resin ducts in trees from temperate coniferous forests. The resin\r\nacids are formed when two-carbon and three-carbon molecules couple with\r\nisoprene building units to form monoterpenes (volatile), sesquiterpenes\r\n(volatile), and diterpenes (nonvolatile) structures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Oleoresin in pines is defined as\r\npine gum, which is the nonaqueous secretion of resin acids. The production of\r\noleoresin by conifer species is an important component of the defense response\r\nagainst insect attack and fungal pathogen infection.\u00a0 dissolved in a terpene\r\nhydrocarbon oil, which is produced in or exuded from the intercellular resin\r\nducts of a living tree. The viscous oleoresin secretion is composed of a\r\ncomplex mixture of terpenoids, consisting of roughly equal parts of volatile\r\nturpentine and rosin (also known as diterpene resin acids).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Pines contain numerous vertical\r\nand radial resin ducts scattered throughout the entire wood. The accumulation\r\nof resin in the heartwood and resin ducts causes a maximum concentration in the\r\nbase of the older trees. Resin in the sapwood, however, is less at the base of\r\nthe tree and increases with height. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The commercial manufacture of\r\nwood pulp grade chemical cellulose using the kraft chemical pulping processes\r\nreleases resin acids. The Kraft process is conducted under strongly basic\r\nconditions of sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfide and sodium hydrosulfide, which\r\nneutralizes these resin acids, converting them to their respective sodium\r\nsalts, sodium abietate, ((CH3)4C15H17COONa) sodium pimarate\r\n((CH3)3(CH2)C15H23COONa) and so on. In this form, the sodium salts are\r\ninsoluble and, being of lower density than the spent pulping process liquor,\r\nfloat to the surface of storage vessels during the process of concentration, as\r\na somewhat gelatinous pasty fluid called kraft soap, or resin soap.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Kraft soap can be reneutralized\r\nwith sulfuric acid to restore the acidic forms abietic acid, palmitic acid, and\r\nrelated resin acid components. This refined mixture is called tall oil. Other\r\nmajor components include fatty acids and unsaponifiable sterols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Resin acids, because of the same\r\nprotectant nature they provide in the trees where they originate, also impose\r\ntoxic implications on the effluent treatment facilities in pulp manufacturing\r\nplants. Furthermore, any residual resin acids that pass the treatment\r\nfacilities add toxicity to the stream discharged to the receiving waters. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alkali metal salts of wood rosin\r\nare amphiphilic and in certain concentrations in water exhibit mesophase\r\nbehaviour.</span></p> <p>Use may require material be molten.

Commercially, the manufacture of wood pulp grade chemical cellulose using the Kraft chemical pulping processes releases these resin acid constituents from rosin. Laboratory and field studies evaluating pulp mill waste streams confirm that the wood-derived resin acids will readily biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in water and sediments, although the rate of degradation appears quite variable depending on site conditions.</p> <p>In water, the complete biodegradation of abietic acid was shown to occur within a 7 day period. \u00a0Resin acids in both river waters and sediment associated with a pulp mill were measured, and results indicated variable amounts of degradation of abietic, isopimaric, and pimaric acids, among others. Variations in the water column distributions reflected both degradation of the more labile resin acids and redistribution of the resin acids between aqueous, colloid and sediment phases. Resin acids (RA) and their aromatised derivative retene can be long-lasting sources to expose benthic biota. Dredging or other human actions can liberate these potential toxicants, even from deep sediments, to an aqueous phase with harmful consequences to aquatic species.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish 96 h 100-200 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna EC50 (48 h) 238-479 mg/l</p> <p>Algae EC50 (72 h): \u00a0Selenastrum capricornutum185-217 mg/l</p> <p><span>Monomethyltin chloride, thioglycolate\r\nesters, and tall oil ester reaction product</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Monomethyltin trichloride (MMTC, CAS RN:\r\n993-16-8), monomethyltin tris[2-ethylhexylmercaptoacetate (MMT (EHTG; MMT\r\n(2-EHMA)), CAS RN: 57583-34-3), monomethyltin tris[isooctylmercaptoacetate\r\n(MMT(IOTG), CAS RN: 54849-38-6), CAS RN: 57583-34-3) and methyltin reverse\r\nester tallate reaction product (TERP, CAS RNs: 201687-58-3, 201687-57-2,\r\n68442-12-6, 151436-98-5) are considered as a single category of compounds for\r\nthe purpose of an environmental assessment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>All share a MMTC as a building block.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>MMT(IOTG), MMT(EHTG), and TERP are\r\nsparingly soluble in water (0.6-10.7 mg/L).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "Two year feeding studies in dogs and rats at 1% dietary level showed decreased body weight and increase liver size. At 0.2% dietary level animals showed no abnormalities related to rosin acids and no abnormal tumor incidence. [HATRICK]|55r43<p>Rosin (colophany) has caused allergic contact dermatitis in solderers using resin flux-cored solders, can be a sensitiser for strings players, and has caused dermatitis after use in adhesive tapes [<i>NIOSHTEC</i>]. It is found in many products that commonly come in contact with the skin, including cosmetics, sunscreens, veterinary medications, adhesives, sealants, polishes, paints and oils. Industrial use of rosins (both natural and modified) is common and they are found in such products as printing inks, cutting fluids, corrosion inhibitors and surface coatings. High-quality gloss paper may also be coated with rosin or its derivatives.</p> <p>The main component of rosin is abietic acid, which by itself is non-sensitising.</p> <p>Several allergens have been isolated from rosin; these include 15-hydroperoxyabietic acid (15-HPA) and 15-hydroperoxydehydroabietic acid (15-HPDA), \u00a0a peroxide of dehydroabietic acid. In animal allergic-challenge testing, these two substances are cross-reactive despite differences in molecular weight and unsaturation. Both substances react via a radical mechanism generating structurally similar molecules which give rise to antigens producing the allergic reaction.</p> <p><i>Gafvert et al: Arch Dermatol Res 284; 1992; \u00a0pp 409-413</i></p> <p>For a better understanding of the mechanisms of contact allergic reactions, the patterns of cross-reactivity between different resin acid oxidation products were studied.</p> <p>The 13,14(a)-epoxide and the 13,14(b)-epoxide of abietic acid and 15-HPDA are contact allergens in experimental studies. The b-epoxide of abietic acid has been detected in gum rosins.</p> <p>Cross reactivity has been observed between the a - and b- epoxides and also between the epoxides and 15-HPA (and also between 15-HPDA and 15-HPA). This can be explained if 15-HPA forms an epoxide which then reacts with skin protein to generate the complete antigen. Cross-reactivity between the two hydroperoxides might be preceded by the formation of similar alkoxy radicals which further react with skin protein. Cross-reactivity patterns of resin oxidation products indicate that 15-HPA may react with skin proteins either as a radical or as an epoxide, thus generating different antigens.</p> <p><i>Gafvert et al: Chemical Research in Toxicology; 1994; pp 260-266</i></p> <p>Esterification of rosin, with polyalcohols for example, reduces allergenic activity although some individuals still are allergic to the polyester. Reduced or diminished reaction to glycerol- and pentaerythritol- esterified rosins, is probably due to the formation of larger molecules (with reduced bioavailability).</p> <p>Methyl ester of rosins, however, have molecular weights of similar magnitude to the parent rosin and when both are tested in sensitised patients, there is little difference in reactivity.</p> <p><i>Shao et al: Contact Dermatitis 28; 1993; pp 229-234</i></p> <p>Patch tests conducted using methyl resinate produced a lower level of response than similar tests on the same resin allergic individuals, conducted with glycerol, pentaerythritol and propylene glycol esters of rosin. It was not possible to determine whether those individuals who were methyl resin positive were cross-sensitised or were reacting to a non-specific irritant effect</p> <p><i>Private Communication</i></p> <p>The main compound formed in glycerol-modified rosins is glyceryl triabietate; lesser amounts of the monoabietate and diabietate are also formed. Whilst the triabietate elicits no or low allergenic activity, the monoabietate \u00a0has been identified as a contact allergen.</p> <p>Some individuals react to glycerol-modified rosins: both unmodified abietic acid and the monoabietate have been identified in these modified rosins.</p> <p><i>Gafvert et al. Contact Dermatitis; 31 1994; pp 11-17</i></p> <p>Rosin modified with fumaric acid or maleic anhydride is often used in paper size. A major product of the paper size in the modification of the rosin is fumaropimaric acid (FPA) which is formed by Diels-Alder addition of fumaric acid to levopimaric acid \u00a0(l-abietic anhydride), another of the major components of rosin. The allergenic activity of isomers of FPA, tested in guinea pigs is low but maybe present. After prolonged heating, however, FPA is converted to maleopimaric acid (MPA). \u00a0MPA has been shown to be a potent allergen in previous studies. MPA also forms when abietic acid and fumaric acid are heated together at 220 deg. C and is present in commercially available fumaric acid-</p> <p>modified rosins. Free abietic acid has also been detected in these modified rosins.</p> <p>Fumaric acid-modified rosins were shown to elicit positive test results in guinea pigs sensitised to MPA.</p> <p><i>Gafvert et al: Nordic Pulp and Paper Research Journal 10: 1995; 139-144</i></p> #55terpx <p><span style=\"color:black\">Essential oils and isolates\r\nderived from the Pinacea family, including Pinus and Abies genera, should only\r\nbe used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level,\r\nfor instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine).

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Manufacture of opaque glass and certain transparent glasses; electrostatic copying paper; as flame retardant; in electronics as semiconductor. Used in some animal food additives and fertilizers.|Zinc calcine is impure zinc oxide producing following roasting of zinc sulfide - contains iron, cadmium, copper, arsenic, antimony, cobalt, germanium, nickel and thallium.|Ceramic grades are often calcined to remove any physical water (so they do not clump in the bag). These grades also have a larger particle size and lower surface area (e.g. 3 square meters per gram vs. less than 1; however 99.9% still passes 325 mesh). While calcined grades are said to produce less glaze surface defect problems, many ceramists have used the raw grades without serious issues.

The threshold concentration for fish is 0.1 ppm. Zinc may be concentrated\r\nin the aquatic food chain; it is concentrated over 200,000 times in oysters.\r\nCopper is synergistic but calcium is antagonistic to zinc toxicity in fish.\r\nZinc can accumulate in freshwater animals at 5 -1,130 times the concentration\r\npresent in the water. Furthermore, although zinc actively bioaccumulates in\r\naquatic systems, biota appears to represent a relatively minor sink compared to\r\nsediments. Steady-state zinc bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for 12 aquatic\r\nspecies range from 4 to 24,000. Crustaceans and fish can accumulate zinc from\r\nboth water and food. A BCF of 1,000 was reported for both aquatic plants and\r\nfish, and a value of 10,000 was reported for aquatic invertebrates. The order\r\nof enrichment of zinc in different aquatic organisms was as follows (zinc\r\nconcentrations in \u00b5g/g dry weight appear in parentheses): fish (25), shrimp\r\n(50), mussel (60), periphyton (260), zooplankton (330), and oyster (3,300). The\r\nhigh enrichment in oysters may be due to their ingestion of particulate matter\r\ncontaining higher concentrations of zinc than ambient water. Other\r\ninvestigators have also indicated that organisms associated with sediments have\r\nhigher zinc concentrations than organisms living in the aqueous layer. With\r\nrespect to bioconcentration from soil by terrestrial plants, invertebrates, and\r\nmammals, BCFs of 0.4, 8, and 0.6, respectively, have been reported.

Common piping\r\nmaterials used in distribution systems often contain zinc, as well as other\r\nmetals and alloys. Trace metals may enter the water through corrosion products\r\nor simply by the dissolution of small amounts of metals with which the water\r\ncomes in contact. Reactions with materials of the distribution system,\r\nparticularly in soft low-pH waters, very often have produced concentrations of\r\nzinc in tap water much greater than those in the raw or treated waters at the\r\nplant of origin. Zinc gives water a metallic taste at low levels. Overexposures\r\nto zinc also have been associated with toxic effects. Ingestion of zinc or\r\nzinc-containing compounds has resulted in a variety of systemic effects in the\r\ngastrointestinal and hematological systems and alterations in the blood lipid\r\nprofile in humans and animals. In addition, lesions have been observed in the\r\nliver, pancreas, and kidneys of animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental toxicity of zinc in water is dependent upon the\r\nconcentration of other minerals and the pH of the solution, which affect the\r\nligands that associate with zinc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Zinc occurs in the environment mainly in the +2 oxidation state.\r\nSorption is the dominant reaction, resulting in the enrichment of zinc in suspended\r\nand bed sediments. Zinc in aerobic waters is partitioned into sediments through\r\nsorption onto hydrous iron and manganese oxides, clay minerals, and organic\r\nmaterial. The efficiency of these materials in removing zinc from solution\r\nvaries according to their concentrations, pH, redox potential (Eh), salinity,\r\nnature and concentrations of complexing ligands, cation exchange capacity, and\r\nthe concentration of zinc. Precipitation of soluble zinc compounds appears to\r\nbe significant only under reducing conditions in highly polluted water.\r\nGenerally, at lower pH values, zinc remains as the free ion.

In a study of the effect of pH on zinc solubility: When the pH is\r\n&lt;7, an inverse relationship exists between the pH and the amount of zinc in\r\nsolution. As negative charges on soil surfaces increase with increasing pH,\r\nadditional sites for zinc adsorption are activated and the amount of zinc in\r\nsolution decreases. The active zinc species in the adsorbed state is the singly\r\ncharged zinc hydroxide species (i.e., Zn[OH]+). Other investigators have also\r\nshown that the mobility of zinc in soil increases at lower soil pH under\r\noxidizing conditions and at a lower cation exchange capacity of soil. On the\r\nother hand, the amount of zinc in solution generally increases when the pH is\r\n&gt;7 in soils high in organic matter. This is a result of the release of\r\norganically complexed zinc, reduced zinc adsorption at higher pH, or an\r\nincrease in the concentration of chelating agents in soil. For calcareous\r\nsoils, the relationship between zinc solubility and pH is nonlinear. At a high\r\npH, zinc in solution is precipitated as Zn(OH)2, zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), or\r\ncalcium zincate. Clay and metal oxides are capable of sorbing zinc and tend to\r\nretard its mobility in soil.

There are few data regarding the speciation of zinc released to the\r\natmosphere. Zinc is removed from the air by dry and wet deposition, but zinc\r\nparticles with small diameters and low densities suspended in the atmosphere\r\ntravel long distances from emission sources.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>for zinc oxide:</p> <p>Zinc oxide intoxication (intoxication zincale) is characterised by general depression, shivering, headache, thirst, colic and diarrhoea.</p> <p>Exposure to the fume may produce metal fume fever characterised by chills, muscular pain, nausea and vomiting.

Vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, in several cases with blood, have been observed after ingestion of zinc sulfate.</p> <p>Several cases of gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported after ingestion of zinc sulfate. A significant reduction in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (47% decrease), hematocrit, and serum ferritin, compared to pretreatment levels, occurred in female subjects who received supplements (as capsules) of 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 10 weeks. A 15% decrease in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was reported in male volunteers receiving 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 6 weeks. Another study reported increases in bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels (~25%) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (~15%), while significant decreases were seen in mononuclear white cell 5'-nucleotidase (~30%) and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activity (~36%) following exposure of postmenopausal women to a combined (dietary+supplemental) 53 mg zinc/day as zinc glycine chelate. Healthy men given 200 mg zinc/day as elemental zinc for 6 weeks showed a reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response to phytohemagglutinin as well as chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.; however, no changes in lymphocyte cell number or in the proportion of lymphocyte populations were noted. Exposure of male volunteers to 0.48 mg zinc/kg/day, as zinc glycine chelate, had no effect on markers of coagulation relative to unexposed subjects. While the changes in</p> <p>hematological end points following long-term zinc exposure in humans are noteworthy, they were subclinical in nature, and therefore, are generally considered to be non-adverse. In animals, following oral administration of zinc compounds, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte, and/or leukocyte levels were observed in rats, mice, rabbits , dogs, ferrets, and preruminant calves A number of intermediate-duration studies have demonstrated renal effects in animals exposed to zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc acetate. Zinc sulfate caused an increase in the absolute and relative kidney weights and regressive kidney lesions (not specified) in female mice that consumed 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day in the diet for 13 weeks, but no effects occurred in rats that consumed 565 mg zinc/kg/day or in mice that consumed 104 mg zinc/kg/day under similar conditions. Severe diffuse nephrosis was</p> <p>observed in ferrets exposed to 195 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet . In rats exposed to 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 3 months, epithelial cell damage in the glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubules and increased plasma creatinine and urea levels were observed. Zinc plays a role in the normal development and maintenance of the immune system, such as in the lymphocyte response to mitogens and as a cofactor for the thymic hormone thymulin. Oral exposure to zinc at levels much higher than the recommended daily dose has impaired immune and inflammatory responses. This was observed in in vivo investigations of the immune competence of blood components taken from 11 healthy adult men after ingestion of 4.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 6 weeks. The mitogenic response elicited from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the chemotactic and phagocytic responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were impaired after zinc ingestion. No effects were seen on total numbers of lymphocytes or relative numbers of T cells, T cell subsets, or B cells. The relationship between these observations and decreased levels of immune competence that might lead to increased susceptibility to disease is unknown. A later study reported no effects of supplementation of male volunteers with 30 mg zinc/day (0.43 mg zinc/kg/day assuming a reference male body weight of 70 kg) as zinc glycine chelate for 14 weeks on levels of peripheral blood leucocytes or on the frequency of lymphocyte subsets.</p> <p>Zinc appears to be necessary for normal brain function, but excess zinc is toxic. A 16-year-old boy who ingested .86 mg zinc/kg/day of metallic zinc over a 2-day period in an attempt to promote wound healing, developed signs and symptoms of lethargy, light-headedness, staggering, and difficulty in writing clearly . Lethargy was also observed in a 2-year-old child who ingested a zinc chloride solution (.1,000 mg zinc/kg). It is not known whether these observations represent direct effects on the nervous system. Very limited data were located regarding neurological effects in animals. Minor neuron degeneration and proliferation of oligodendroglia occurred in rats dosed with 487 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 10 days. Rats receiving 472 mg zinc/kg/day for 10 days had increased levels of secretory material in the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus. Mice exposed postnatally to 0.5 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 28 days showed no changes in memory formation, but showed a gradual decrease in learning extinction throughout the study.</p>",

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival. For high bioavailability waters, effect concentrations for several sensitive species may be below 10 ug Cu/litre.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In fish, the acute lethal concentration of copper ranges from a few ug/litre to several mg/litre, depending both on test species and exposure conditions. Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival. Lower effect concentrations are generally associated with test waters of high bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In summary:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Responses expected for high concentration ranges of copper *</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Total dissolved Cu concentration range (ug/litre)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Effects of high availability in water</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1-10</p>  </td> <td> <p>Significant effects are expected for diatoms and sensitive invertebrates, notably cladocerans.</p> <p>Effects on fish could be significant in freshwaters with low pH and hardness.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>10-100</p>  </td> <td> <p>Significant effects are expected on various species of microalgae, some species of macroalgae, and a range of invertebrates, including crustaceans, gastropods and sea urchins. \u00a0Survival of sensitive fish will be affected and a variety of fish show sublethal effects.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>100-1000</p>  </td> <td> <p>Most taxonomic groups of macroalgae and invertebrates will be severely affected. \u00a0Lethal levels for most fish species will be reached.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>&gt;1000</p>  </td> <td> <p>Lethal concentrations for most tolerant organisms are reached.</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* Sites chosen have moderate to high bioavailability similar to water used in most toxicity tests.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In soil, copper levels are raised by application of fertiliser, fungicides, from deposition of highway dusts and from urban, mining and industrial sources. Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site. International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS): Environmental Health Criteria 200</p> <p>Metal-containing inorganic substances generally have negligible vapour pressure and are not expected to partition to air. Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Capillary, kidney, liver and brain damage are the longer term manifestations of such poisoning. Inhalation of freshly formed metal oxide particles sized below 1.5 microns and generally between 0.02 to 0.05 microns may result in \"metal fume fever\". Symptoms may be delayed for up to 12 hours and begin with the sudden onset of thirst, and a sweet, metallic or foul taste in the mouth. Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur.

Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Copper salts, in contact with the eye, may produce conjunctivitis or even ulceration and turbidity of the cornea.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Exposure to copper, by skin, has come from its use in pigments, ointments, ornaments, jewellery, dental amalgams and IUDs and as an antifungal agent and an algicide. Although copper algicides are used in the treatment of water in swimming pools and reservoirs, there are no reports of toxicity from these applications. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum. The investigators warned, however, that the possibility of contamination with nickel (an established contact allergen) might have been the cause of the reaction. Copper salts often produce an itching eczema in contact with skin. This is, likely, of a non-allergic nature.</span></p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",

Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen chloride</p> <p>phosgene</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments The liquid may produce considerable gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful or toxic if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted.

                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
