Inhaled cardioselective bronchodilators (e.g. Alupent, Salbutamol) are the preferred agents, with aminophylline a second choice.\u00a0</li> <li>Lavage is indicated in patients who require decontamination; ensure use of cuffed endotracheal tube in adult patients.

The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22\r\nrange are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and\r\naromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some\r\nmicroorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and\r\nthus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are\r\nbiodegradable only by a narrow range of specialised hydrocarbon degraders; and\r\nn-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not\r\navailable to degrading microorganisms.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Repeated application of mildly hydrotreated oils (principally paraffinic), to mouse skin, induced skin tumours; no tumours were induced with severely hydrotreated oils.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness.

This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour. A STEL is recommended to prevent mucous membrane and ocular irritation and prevention of acute depression of the central nervous system. Because of the wide variation in molecular weights of its components, the conversion of ppm to mg/m3 is approximate. Sweden recommends hexane type limits of 100 ppm and heptane and octane type limits of 300 ppm.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays.

Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Repeated application of mildly hydrotreated oils (principally paraffinic), to mouse skin, induced skin tumours; no tumours were induced with severely hydrotreated oils.</p> <p>Steam-cracked residues produced an increased incidence of skin tumours after repeated applications to the skin of mice.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>metal oxides</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Lead in the form of alkyls has been introduced to the environment primarily from leaded petrol. These are converted to water-soluble lead compounds of high toxicity and availability to plants. Such compounds easily leach from soil to contaminate water sources close to highways. Lead that has entered the aquatic system from run-off or as fallout of insoluble precipitates is found in sediments. The biological methylation of inorganic lead by lake sediment micro-organisms has been demonstrated although its significance is not entirely clear. Other forms of soluble or insoluble lead may also enter the environment and undergo bioaccumulation through a series of biological incidents.</p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><span>For fatty acid salts:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Several tests concerning biodegradation are\r\navailable. All tests showed that fatty acids and lipids are readily\r\nbiodegradable. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>No experimental bioaccumulation data appear\r\nto be available but log Kow data from various sources are higher than 4, which\r\nindicates that fatty acids and natural lipids have a potential for\r\nbioaccumulating\u00a0 in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In sludge and sediment soaps are strongly\r\nadsorbed. The normalised adsorption constant of log Koc is estimated\r\nat\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.4-6.6 l/kg.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>A TNO report on the biodegradability of\r\nsoaps from fatty acids with different carbon chain lengths concluded that even\r\nafter short time periods a high level of primary bacteriological degradation is\r\nachieved in all cases. The requirement for a biodegradation of &gt;60% is\r\nreadily met within short test periods, indicating that soaps are characterized\r\nby excellent degradability. All the evidence points to rapid degradation in\r\nwaste\u2013treatment plants as well. Both short\u2013 and long\u2013chain soaps are degraded\r\ncompletely under aerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Fatty acids undergo aerobic biodegradation\r\nby the process of beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation of the parent fatty acid forms\r\nacetate and a new fatty acid of two less carbon atoms. This process repeats\r\nitself until the compound is completely broken down. The hydrocarbon will\r\neventually be degraded to CO2 and H2O. For this reason, the length of the fatty\r\nacid chain does not preclude biodegradation, but it may take longer to achieve\r\ncomplete mineralisation. The beta-oxidation sequence does not necessarily\r\nrequire the presence of molecular oxygen, and fatty acid biodegradation may\r\nproceed under anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Above a certain concentration level these\r\nsoaps will form micelles, which are aggregates of soap molecules into larger,\r\noriented groups. This Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) may be around 1000\r\nmg/l but depends on many factors like the molecule structure, the salt content\r\nof the solution and the temperature it may be an order of magnitude lower or\r\nhigher.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The soap concentration in the environment\r\nare in the range of or far below 10 mg/l, whereas the CMC is usually 10-100\r\ntimes higher. At conditions for biodegradability or toxicity testing\r\nconcentrations above the CMC may occur.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>There are a number of acute data for fatty\r\nacids and fatty acid salts to aquatic organisms although there is a\r\npredominance of data for fatty acid. There are few toxicity values for\r\nterrestrial organisms. Data availability / quality covering all the taxonomic\r\ngroups for specific fatty acid salt chain lengths is poor. The chronic data set\r\nis very limited. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>For chain lengths &gt;C12, solubility\r\ndecreases to a degree where an adverse effect would not be expected in the\r\nenvironment due to reduced biovailability. Data for longer chain lengths have\r\nbeen generated using solvents which makes interpretation more difficult. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The most of few available data indicate low\r\ntoxicity towards aquatic organisms with EC/LC50 values above 1000 mg/l.\r\nHowever, EC/LC50 values below 100 mg/l are not unusual either. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Notes:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Fatty acid soaps are widely used in\r\nhousehold cleaning products, cosmetics, lubricants (and other miscellaneous\r\nindustrial applications) and coatings.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>The lead concentration in air is to be maintained so that the lead concentration in workers' blood remains below 0.060 mg/100 g of whole blood. The recommended TLV-TWA has been derived following a review of reports of adverse effects on reproduction, blood-pressure and other end-points of toxicity. A particular focus was an assessment of pre-natal blood lead (PbB) levels and post-natal cognitive levels. The fact that lead is a cumulative toxicant which can produce subtle, persistent and apparently permanent effects in the off-spring of lead exposed women is of particular concern. A current view holds that the identification of the PbB levels, that are protective during a working lifetime, is a necessary prerequisite in the recommendation of the TLV because PbB values, rather than workplace air lead concentrations, are more clearly related to adverse health effects.</p> <p>(see Biological Exposure Index - BEI - in \"Advice to Doctor\".)</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Low concentrations may produce immediate discomfort, conjunctival hyperaemia, and oedema of the corneal epithelium. Healing may take several days. Temporary clouding of the cornea may occur.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Anionic surfactants/ hydrotropes generally produce skin reactions following the removal of natural oils. The skin may appear red and may become sore. Papular dermatitis may also develop.

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Excessive exposure to lead can affect the blood, the nervous system, heart, endocrine organs and the immune system and the digestive system. The synthesis of haemoglobin is inhibited and can result in anaemia. If left untreated, neuromuscular dysfunction, possible paralysis and encephalopathy (brain tissue damage) may result. Other symptoms of overexposure include joint and muscle pain, weakness of the extensor muscles (frequently the hand and wrist), headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, blue line on the gums, insomnia and metallic taste. High body levels produce cerebrospinal pressure, brain damage with stupor leading to coma and, in some cases, death. Early symptoms of lead poisoning (\"plumbism\") include anorexia and loss of weight, constipation, apathy or irritability, occasional vomiting, fatigue, headache, weakness, and a metallic taste in the mouth. Advanced poisonings are characterised by intermittent vomiting, irritability, nervousness, myalgia of the arms and legs (often with wrist and foot drop). Severe poisonings may produce persistent vomiting, ataxia, stupor or lethargy, visual disturbances progressing to optic neuritis and atrophy, hyper- tension, papilloedema, cranial nerve paralysis, delirium, convulsions and coma. Neurological effects include mental retardation, seizures, cerebral palsy and marked muscular contractions that distort the spine, limbs, hips and sometimes the cranial inervated muscles (dystonia musculorum deformans). Industrial exposure has been associated with irreversible kidney damage.</p> <p>Lead is a cumulative poison with adverse effects in pregnancy [NIOSHTIC]\u00a0</p> <p>Lead salts have been reported to cross the placenta and induce embryo- and foeto-mortality. They also may have a teratogenic effect (causing birth deformities) in certain animal species. Organometallic lead may not produce these effects. Adverse effects of lead on human reproduction, embryonic and foetal development and postnatal mental development have also been recorded. Foetal exposure to lead may result in birth defects, mental retardation, behavioural disorders and death during the first year of childhood. Paternal effects may include reduced sex drive, impotence, sterility and adverse effects on the sperm which in turn may increase the potential for increased birth defects. Maternal effects may include miscarriage and stillbirth in exposed women, or women whose husbands might be exposed, sterility or decreased fertility, and abnormal menses. Exposure by both parents to lead may exacerbate the reproductive effects.</p>",
