Generally haloalkanes contributing to the greenhouse effect consist of a fully or partly fluorinated carbon backbone.\u00a0</p> <p>Gas-phase reactions with OH radicals are the major tropospheric loss process for the haloalkanes. In addition photooxidation reactions with O3 and NO3 radicals can result in transformation.</p> <p>Organic substances containing chlorine, if primarily present in the atmospheric compartment and if their lifetime is long enough can reach the stratosphere and decompose through photolysis and other chemical reaction (e.g. with OH radical). Chlorine atoms can then participate in the catalytic ozone destruction cycles. The atmospheric lifetime is too short to enable a significant fraction of the compound emitted to reach the stratosphere\u00a0</p> <p>Haloalkanes do not hydrolyse easily. Acids do not catalyse the hydrolysis and base catalysis is only important at higher pHs than are observed in the environment.</p> <p>The apparent hazard of halo- alkanes and alkenes to human health has prompted investigations concerning their fate in subsurface waters and in soil. Although abiotic transformations may be significant within the time scales commonly associated with groundwater movement, biotic process typically proceed much faster, provided that there are sufficient substrates, nutrients and microbial populations to mediate such transformations. Several bacterial strains including methane-utilising bacteria capable of utilising haloalkanes have been isolated. Microbial dehalogenation by these strains is mediated by enzymes (oxygenase and hydrolase). The biodegradation of haloalkanes can proceed through different pathways. Haloparaffins (C12 to C18) have been reported to be incorporated into fatty acids in bacteria, yeasts, and fungi , resulting in their accumulation in the food chain. Another pathway is the oxygenation at the nonhalogenated end of monohalogenated alkanes by an inherent oxygenase with a tight substrate selectivity In this case fluoroalkanes were defluorinated, but no dehalogenation was observed with chloro-, bromo-, or iodoalkanes. Chain length was reported to have minor effects on this oxygenation reaction. In general, alpha- and alpha,omega-chlorinated haloalkanes with short carbon chains (C1 to C6) are dehalogenated hydrolytically or by a glutathione-dependent mechanism. In contrast, alpha- and alpha,omega-haloalkanes with longer chains, e.g., 1,9-dichlorononane and 1,10-dichlorodecane (1,10-DCD), have been proposed to be dehalogenated by oxidative mechanisms. Studies on the biodegradation of this class of compounds are rare, because haloalkane-degrading microorganisms are not easily found</p> <p>In water and terrestrial compartments haloalkanes may hydrolyse in the presence of naturally occurring sulfur-containing nucleophiles Bisulfide ion (HS-) is generally the most important nucleophile because it is moderately reactive and is usually present at the highest concentration. When elemental sulfur is present, polysulfides(S4 2- and S5 2-) will be more important than HS- at pH 7 (approximately) because they are 60 times more reactive and their equilibrium concentrations increase with increasing pH. The end products of such reactions include a variety of mercaptans and dialkyl sulfides.</p> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>for trichloroethylene:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>log Kow : 2.2-3.3</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>log Koc : 2</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Koc : 87-150</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 0.0103</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>BCF : 17-1160</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Drinking Water Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>trichloroethylene: 30 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>70 mg/l (WHO provisional guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>hydrocarbon total: 10 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Soil Guidelines: Dutch Criteria:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>0.001 mg/kg (target)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>60 mg/kg (intervention)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Air Quality Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>1 mg/m3 averaging time 24 hours (WHO Guideline</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Trichloroethylene quickly reacts in air, especially under smog\r\nconditions; atmospheric residence time is up to 5 days.

Studies of the degradation of trichloroethylene\r\nin water during ultraviolet irradiation indicated that degradation decreased\r\nwith increases in the total organic content of the water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Biotransformation was also strongly indicated as a factor in the\r\ndegradation of trichloroethylene in a case of soil and groundwater pollution.\r\nSince neither biodegradation nor hydrolysis occurs at a rapid rate, most\r\ntrichloroethylene present in surface waters can be expected to volatilize into\r\nthe atmosphere. However, because trichloroethylene is denser than and only\r\nmoderately soluble in water, that which is not immediately volatilized may be\r\nexpected to submerge and thus be removed from contact with the surface.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Anaesthetics and narcotic effects (with dulling of senses and odour fatigue) are a consequence of exposure to chlorinated solvents.</p> <p>\u00a0Individual response varies widely; odour may not be considered objectionable at levels which quickly induce central nervous system effects.

There is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity.

The resulting oxiranes are highly reactive and may covalently bind to nucleic acids leading to mutations and possible cancers A measure of such potential carcinogenicity is the development of significant preneoplastic foci in livers of treated rats.</p> <p>The carcinogenicity of halogenated oxiranes may lie in the reactivity of an epoxide intermediate. It is reported that 1,1-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and chloroprene, for example, \u00a0are carcinogens in vivo - this may be a consequence of oxirane formation.</p> <p>Symmetrically substituted oxiranes such as 1,2-dichloroethylene and 1,1,2-2-tetrachloroethylene are more stable and less mutagenic than unsymmetrical chlorinated oxiranes such as 1,1-dichloroethylene, 1,1,2-trichloroethylene and monochloroethylene (vinyl chloride).</p> <p>The carcinogenicity of 1,1-dichloroethylene has primarily been associated with inhalation exposure while that of vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene occurs following exposure by both inhalation and oral routes.\u00a0<i>National Toxicology Program Toxicity Report Series Number 55; April 2002</i></p> <p>\u00a0Various studies report an association between cancer and industrial exposure to tetrachloroethylene; IARC concluded that this evidence is sufficient to assign appropriate warnings. Similar warnings have been issued by IARC for vinyl fluoride. Similarly vinyl bromide exhibited neoplastic and tumourigenic \u00a0activity in rats exposed by inhalation and is classified by various bodies as potentially carcinogenic.</p> <p>Substances such as chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), are reported to produce an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the lymphocytes of Russian workers. Russian epidemiological studies also suggest an increased incidence of skin and lung cancer following exposure to chloroprene, a result which is not supported by other studies.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the monohalogenated substances exhibit higher carcinogenic potential than their dihalogenated counterparts. Whether additional substitution lessens such hazard is conjectural. Tetrafluoroethylene, for example, produced clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in a two-year inhalation study in rats and mice.\u00a0<i>National Toxicology Program Technical Report Series 450, April 1997</i></p>",
