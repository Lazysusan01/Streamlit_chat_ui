Nitrate can contaminate groundwater to unacceptable levels. Nitrite is formed from nitrate or ammonium ion by micro-organisms in soil, water, sewage and the alimentary tract. The concern with nitrate in the environment is related to its conversion to nitrite.</p> <p>\u00a0Methaemoglobinaemia is caused following exposure to high levels of nitrite and produces difficulties in oxygen transport in the blood. Thousands of cases involving poisoning of infants, particularly in rural areas, have been reported as a result of drinking nitrate rich well-water.</p> <p>\u00a0Other concerns deriving from exposure to environmental nitrates relate to the production of nitrosamines following the reaction of food nitrites and secondary amines. Other nitroso-compounds may result following reaction with nitrites and amides, ureas, carbamates and other nitrogenous compounds. Nitrosamines produce liver damage, haemorrhagic lung lesions, convulsions and coma in rats, and teratogenic effects in experimental animals.</p> <p>\u00a0The N-nitroso class of compounds include potent carcinogens and mutagens: induction of tumors by single doses of N-nitroso compounds testify to this.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Serious poisoning may cause blood disorders, anaemia, nephritis and methaemoglobinaemia.|51r22<p>The principal concern with exposure to inorganic nitrate is its biological reduction to reactive and toxic nitrite. Nitrate itself is relatively harmless. Where bacteria are present and the environment is anaerobic, nitrate can be reduced to nitrite. The main site for this reaction is mouth and stomach, but nitrite formation in the lower intestine and in the bladder (urinary infection) may also be of some toxicological importance.</p>\n<p>Adults have tolerated large doses of nitrate as sodium and ammonium salt (&gt; 100 mg NO3-/kg) in some cases repeated for several days for medical or experimental purposes with only minor effects in some subjects (light methaemoglobinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting). Death and severe effects of nitrate ingestion are generally associated with doses above 10 g NO3-. Doses between 2 and 9 g NO3- have been reported to cause methaemoglobinaemia. These values correspond to 33 to 150 mg NO3-/kg</p>\n<p>The half-life in the body for an oral dose of nitrate to be approximately 5 hours. As blood absorption depends on food matrix and route of exposure, and as larger doses may increase the urinary excretion rate, the biological half-life for both nitrate and nitrite should be expected to be 3 to 8 hours.Nitrate does not accumulate in the body.</p>\n<p>The major acute toxic effect of nitrate and nitrite poisoning is methaemoglobinaemia.</p> <p>The lethal oral dose of nitrite for adults has been variously reported to be between 0.7 and 6 g NO2- (approximately 10 to 100 mg NO2-/kg). Lower doses may apply for children (especially neonates), the elderly and people with certain enzyme deficiencies. The first symptoms of oral nitrite poisoning develop within 15 to 45 minutes</p>\n<p>In humans, inorganic nitrites produce smooth muscle relaxation, methaemoglobinaemia and cyanosis.The primary effect of nitrite intoxication in animals is methaemoglobinaemia whilst secondary effects include vasodilation, relaxation of smooth muscle and lowering of blood pressure. Other nitrite-induced toxic effects include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, atrophied intestinal villi and apoptotic cell death in the intestinal crypts. Nitrite may also cause sudden fall in blood pressure due to its vasodilating properties.Nitrite has vasodilating properties, probably through transformation into nitric oxide (NO) or a NO-containing molecule acting as a signal factor for smooth muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p>Fatal poisonings in infants, resulting from ingestion of nitrates in water or spinach, have been reported.</p>\n<p>When sodium nitrite was administered in drinking water for 6 weeks (0.06-1%), mice showed a slight degeneration and spotty necrosis of hepatocytes and haemosiderin deposition in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, indicating haemolysis. At 2%, mice died within 3 weeks. In rats, subject to the same treatment regime, abnormal blood and spleen colours, due to MHG, were seen in 0.5% and 1.0% treatment groups. Hepatic microsomal lipoperoxidation (as measured by malondialdehyde formation) was increased in male rats given 0.2% sodium nitrite in drinking water. Liver lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase aaand cathepsin) and superoxide dismutase activities were also increased. This data suggests that the nitrite stimulates generation of superoxide radicals in the liver causing damage to cellular and subcellular membranes. Decreased plasma vitamin E and greater reduced glutathione-per erythrocyte were also reported in male rats receiving sodium nitrite in drinking water.</p> <p>The substance and/or its metabolites may bind to haemoglobin inhibiting normal uptake of oxygen. This condition, known as \"methaemoglobinemia\", is a form of oxygen starvation (anoxia).</p> <p>\u00a0Symptoms include cyanosis (a bluish discolouration skin and mucous membranes) and breathing difficulties. Symptoms may not be evident until several hours after exposure.</p> <p>\u00a0At about 15% concentration of blood methaemoglobin there is observable cyanosis of the lips, nose and earlobes. Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor. Above 60% symptoms include dyspnea, respiratory depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, and convulsions. Levels exceeding 70% may be fatal.\u00a0</p>",
