LAS are mainly used in laundry detergents and cleaning agents. LAS are\r\nfrequently used as the sodium salts as the sole surfactant in a formulation or\r\nin conjunction with other anionic, nonionic or cationic surfactants. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The chemicals in this group can\r\nhave an alkyl chain between 10 and 16 carbon atoms. The main commercial grade\r\nmaterial is typically limited to a range of 10-14 or 10-13 carbons with a\r\ndodecyl-component of 20-35 %. The carbon chain distribution of the chemicals\r\nwill vary depending on the method of production and the source of the precursor\r\nchemicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">T he chemicals in this group are\r\nexpected to have similar toxicity, which is primarily due to the alkylbenzene\r\nsulfonate anion. They share similar physico-chemical properties, including\r\ndensity and melting points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The solubility of the homologues\r\ndiffers based on the alkyl chain length, usually decreasing with increasing\r\nchain length.However, as the chemicals are also mixtures of positional isomers,\r\nchemicals with the same alkyl chain distribution (same average carbon number)\r\ncan have different properties depending on the 2-phenyl isomer content\r\n(consistent with 4-substitution as the major product with smaller amounts of\r\nthe 2-substitution) </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS consist of an alkyl chain\r\nattached to a benzene ring in the para position to the sulfonate group.\r\nSometimes toluene, xylene and naphthalene are used in place of benzene. The\r\nhomologue distribution in commercial products covers alkyl chain lengths from\r\nC10 to C13 with an average chain length of C11.6. LAS raw materials are derived\r\nfrom linear alkyl benzenes in which the ring is attached to a C-atom which is\r\nitself attached to two other C-atoms. The benzene ring may be attached to any\r\nof the C atoms from C2 to C6 but not to C1. Structures in which the benzene ring\r\nmay be attached to different C atoms are described as isomers. E.g., the\r\nstructure with a C12 alkyl chain and the benzene ring attached at the second\r\nalkyl carbon is designated as the C12-2-isomer and abbreviated C12-2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS can be represented\r\nstructurally as:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">H3C(CH3)xCH(C6H4S)3.Na+)CH2(CH2)yCH3\r\n- x+y=9</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Compared to traditional soaps\r\nbranched alkyl benzenesulfonates (BAS) offer superior tolerance to hard water\r\nand better foaming. However, the highly branched tail made it difficult to\r\nbiodegrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The term \"linear\"\r\nrefers to the starting alkenes rather than the final product. The alkylation of\r\nlinear alkenes, even 1- alkenes such as 1-dodecene gives several isomers of\r\nphenyldodecane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Under ideal conditions the\r\ncleaning power of BAS and LAS is very similar, however LAS performs slightly\r\nbetter in normal use conditions, due to it being less affected by hard water.\r\nWithin LAS itself the detergency of the various isomers are fairly similar,\r\nhowever their physical properties (Krafft point, foaming etc.) are noticeably\r\ndifferent\u00a0 In particular the Krafft point of the high 2-phenyl product remains\r\nbelow 0 deg C up to 25% LAS whereas the low 2-phenyl cloud point is 5 deg C.\r\nThis behavior is often exploited by producers to create either clear or cloudy\r\nproducts.</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture.

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>for diethanolamine (DEA):</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>log Kow &nbsp;: -1.43</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Koc &nbsp;: 4</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Half-life (hr) air &nbsp;: 4</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 5.35E-14</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>BOD 5: 0.03-0.1,0.9%</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>BOD 28: 57 mg/gm</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>COD &nbsp;: 1590 mg/gm</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>TPC 470 mg/gm</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>ThOD &nbsp;: 2.13</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>BCF &nbsp;: &lt;1</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Based on its physicochemical properties and biodegradation\r\ncharacteristics , DEA is not expected to pose a high risk to drinking water,\r\nand its potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. &nbsp;DEA\r\nis categorized as &quot;practically nontoxic&quot; on an acute basis to\r\nfreshwater invertebrates, estuarine/marine invertebrates, and freshwater plants</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>In soil and water, DEA is expected to biodegrade fairly rapidly\r\nfollowing acclimation (half-life on the order of days to weeks).

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p>For linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acids (LABS) (and their salts):<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />LABS  are generally highly water soluble (miscible) and have a relatively low  Kow. The environmental fate data indicate that these chemicals are  highly susceptible to photo-and biodegradation.<br />LABS are strong acids  (pKa &lt;1) that are completely ionised in aqueous solutions. The  chemical species present in aqueous solutions at neutral (physiological)  pH is the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (the LAS ion) (C10-14 linear  alkyl benzene-SO3-), the identical species present in solutions of LAS,  where the counter ion (typically sodium, calcium or ammonium) will  disassociate to form the LAS anion. Thus, the physical-chemical,  environmental fate, ecotoxicity and toxicity properties of the LABS and  LAS would be expected to be similar. It should be noted that the LABS  are liquids and LAS is a solid at room temperature. However, in water  the difference between the LAB sulfonic acids and LAS disappears as  dissociation results in the same ion in solution. Therefore, parameters  such as Kow, water solubility and pH/pKa are appropriate to compare. The  octanol-water partition coefficients are around 2 (log Kow) for all of  the chemicals in this category <br />LABS are not expected to volatilise  significantly. Fugacity modeling predicts that most of these chemicals  will partition to the soil and water. Very little partitions to the air  or sediment. <br />Photodegradation is estimated (using EPI Suite  software) to be a significant mechanism for breakdown. Based on the  model estimates, the hydroxyl radical reaction half-lives ranged from  about 7 to 8.6 hours. Estimated data for LAS were similar. Furthermore,  measured data for LAS suggest even more rapid photodegradation, with 95%  of the material degraded within 20 minutes at 20 C in a laboratory  study. <br />Experimental data data indicates that LAS is stable in water. <br />LABS  are generally biodegradable. Measured biodegradation data indicate  substantial microbial degradation under aerobic conditions. For  dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid 69% of the material mineralised after 28  days. Biodegradation of the C10-16 derivatives and the LAS are also  rapid, with 93% or greater of the material degrading within 28 or 37  days. In addition, studies show that straight chain alkylbenzene  sulfonate materials readily degrade, with the shorter chain length  compounds degrading more rapidly\u00a0 Thus, the data indicate that these  chemicals are highly susceptible to degradation, both by photolytic and  microbial mechanisms <br />The initial step in the biodegradation of LABS  under aerobic conditions is an omega -oxidation of the terminal methyl  group of the alkyl chain to form a carboxylic acid. Further degradation  proceeds by a stepwise shortening of the alkyl chain by beta -oxidation  leaving a short-chain sulfophenyl carboxylic acid. In the presence of  molecular oxygen the aromatic ring structure hydrolyses to form a  dihydroxy-benzene structure which is opened before desulfonation of the  formed sulfonated dicarboxylic acid. The final degradation steps have  not been investigated in details but are likely to occur by general  bacterial metabolic routes involving a total mineralisation and  assimilation into biomass . Both the initial omega -oxidation and the  hydroxylation of the ring structure of LAS require molecular oxygen, and  they are not expected to take place under anoxic conditions.<br />The  BioConcentration Factor (BCF) tends to increase with increasing alkyl  chain length but also the position of the aryl sulfonate moiety was  important. A higher BCF was seen for linear alkyl benzenesulfonate  isomers with the aryl sulfonate attached. Available data indicate that  LABS have low to moderate bioaccumulation potential, with a  bioconcentration factor for dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid of 130. LAS  has bioconcentration factors that range from 22 to 87. <br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Numerous  studies have been performed to determine the effects of LABS towards  aquatic organisms. The aquatic effect concentrations that were observed  in these studies are highly variable. This variation is partly related  to the testing of different isomers and homologues, but it may also be  due to the specific test conditions and species. The length of the alkyl  chain is an important factor determining the aquatic toxicity. In  general, the homologues with the highest number of carbons in the alkyl  chain are more toxic than are those with shorter alkyl chains. Today,  commercial LABS have a homologue distribution between C10 and C13 with a  typical average alkyl chain length of C11.6. <br />The widest range in  the toxicity of LABS towards species belonging to the same group is  found for algae\u00a0 Approximately 90% of the data found in the literature  fall between 0.1 and 100 mg/l. Typical ranges of EC50 values are 1 to  100 mg/l for fresh water species and &lt; 1 to 10 mg/l for marine  species. Typical values lie between 29 and 170 mg/l <br />A very low EC100  value of 0.025 mg/l was determined for Gymnodium breve. Previous  studies in which Gymnodium breve was exposed with AES confirm that this  species is highly sensitive to surfactants, and occasionally available  data for Gymnodium breve should therefore not be used for comparison of  the aquatic toxicity between various surfactants.<br />LC50 values have  been found in the range of 1 to 10 mg/l when Daphnia magna were exposed  with LABS homologues between C10 and C13. The acute toxicity of LABS to  Daphnia magna generally increases with increasing alkyl chain length.\u00a0  Typical values lie between 3 and 12 mg/l. <br />A study with the marine  crustacean Acartia tonsa indicated that a C10-13 LAS affected the  survival at 0.54 mg/l (LC50) and the development rate at 0.51 mg/l  (EC50) after 8 days of exposure. The 48 h-LC50 that was obtained in the  same study with Acartia tonsa was 2.1 mg/l. <br />Metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS are reported to have a much lower toxicity to  invertebrates compared to the toxicity of the intact surfactant.<br />The  toxicity of LABS to fish generally increases with increasing alkyl chain  length, and approximately a 10-fold difference in toxicity between  homologues separated by two carbon atoms has been observed. As also  noted for invertebrates, fish are less susceptible to metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS . LC50 values below 1 mg/l were found for  C11.9 (0.71 mg/l), C13 and C14 (both 0.4 mg/l) in studies with fathead  minnow.<br />LABS sorb to sediment with partition coefficients of 50 to  1,000. The toxicity of LABS bound to sediment is relatively low compared  to LABS in solution. NOEC and LOEC values were as high as 319 and 993  mg LABS/kg, respectively, for the sediment-living Chironomus riparius.  The corresponding NOEC for LABS in solution was as low as 2.4 mg/l  indicating that only a small fraction of the sorbed LABS was  bioavailable. LABS dissolved in water may also cause chronic effects  like reduction of the growth rate of the marine mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis. LABS sorbed to sediments did not have similar  effects.<br />Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in  Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment  Project, 615, 2001.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Anionic surfactants/ hydrotropes generally produce skin reactions following the removal of natural oils.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching.

Repeated inhalation may aggravate asthma and inflammatory or fibrotic pulmonary disease.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Results of repeated exposure tests with diethanolamine (DEA) in laboratory animals include anaemia (rats) and effects on the kidneys (rats and mice) and liver (mice). DEA produces nervous system injury in dogs and rats. Heart and salivary gland lesions have also been seen in mice treated cutaneously with DEA and in mice receiving DEA in drinking water. Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids. They are excreted predominantly unchanged with a half-life of approximately one week. In the absence of sodium nitrite, no conversion to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines was observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Diethanolamine competitively inhibits the cellular uptake of choline, in vitro, and hepatic changes in choline homeostasis, consistent with choline deficiency, are observed in vivo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Many amines are potent skin and respiratory sensitisers and certain individuals especially those described as \"atopic\" (i.e. those predisposed to asthma and other allergic responses) may show allergic reactions when chronically exposed to alkanolamines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In a study with coconut diethanolamide, the National Toxicology Program (Technical Report Series 479), showed clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic and renal tubule neoplasms and in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis in males and females, ulcer in males, and parakeratosis and inflammation in females at the site of application and of follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland of males and females, were chemical related.</p> <p>Absorbed sulfonates are quickly distributed through living systems and are readily excreted. Toxic effects may result from the effects of binding to proteins and the ability of sulfonates to translocate potassium and nitrate (NO3-) ions from cellular to interstitial fluids. Airborne sulfonates may be responsible for respiratory allergies and, in some instances, minor dermal allergies.</p>",

The amide may either be monoethanolamide (MEA),\r\ndiethanolamide (DEA), or monoisopropanolamide (MIPA). Representative structures\r\nof FAA are indicated below.

With tertiary amides (disubstituted amides),\r\nhydrogen bonding is not possible, as exhibited by their increased solubility\r\nand lower melting points. Many fatty acid amides are essentially insoluble in\r\nwater. Amides have a strong tendency to reduce friction on various surfaces by\r\nforming a layer on surfaces. This coating action may be attributed to their\r\nhydrophobic character and strong hydrogen bonding. Fatty acid amides in general\r\nare stable to elevated processing temperatures, air oxidation, and dilute acids\r\nand bases. Alkanolamides are made from triglycerides or fatty acid methyl\r\nesters reacted with monoethanolamine or diethanolamine that then can be\r\nethoxylated with ethylene oxide under basic catalyses. Common products are\r\nstearamide, cocamide, ethylene bis(stearamide), cocamide, DEA or MEA,\r\ncocamidopropyl dimethyl amine, and cocamide monoethanolamine ethoxylate</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Regardless of the carbon number,\r\nthe melting point of most saturated fatty acid amides falls in a range of 100\r\nto 110 C.

FAA consist of a fatty acid, usually derived from coconut oil, which is linked to an amide group by a C-N bond. The amide may be typically either be monoethanolamide (MEA), diethanolamide (DEA), or monoisopropanolamide (MIPA).</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Most fatty acid amides (FAA), such as the widely used cocodiethanolamide (cocoamide DEA) and cocomonoethanolamide (cocoamide MEA), are ultimately degraded in the OECD tests for ready biodegradability under aerobic conditions. The available data describing the aerobic biodegradability of the ethoxylated FAA are contradictory. Certain data indicates that these surfactants do not pass the criteria for ready biodegradability, whereas the opposite is the case for data obtained from Akzo Nobel</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The anaerobic biodegradability of FAA has been examined for cocoamide MEA by using the ECETOC screening test. Ultimate anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamide MEA reached 79% of the theoretical gas production, ThGP, during incubation of diluted digested sludge for 42 days at 35 degree C . By use of the ISO 11734 screening test, which corresponds to the ECETOC method, the ultimate anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamide MEA attained 81% during 56 days</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0No experimental data describing the bioaccumulation potential of fatty acid amides were found in the literature</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The aquatic toxicity of FAA has been determined for species representing the three trophic levels algae, invertebrates, and fish. Cocoamide DEA appears to be more toxic to aquatic organism than cocoamide MEA.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An exceptionally high toxicity of cocoamide MEA was reported for two tests with the green alga\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus\u00a0</i>as the 96 h-EC50 were 1.0 and 1.1 mg/l \u00a0More recent tests with a pure cocoamide ME - purity about 95.5% C12-18 gave EC50 values of 16.6 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus</i>\u00a0and 17.8 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata</i>\u00a0(formerly\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornutum</i>) . The latter data indicate that the toxicity of cocoamide MEA to algae are not markedly higher than the toxicity to daphnids and fish, and EC50 values above 10 mg/l are probably more representative for the toxicity towards algae. The ethoxylated FAA show the same level of aquatic toxicity as the non-ethoxylated FAA</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouses and enclosed storage areas.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><br /></p> <p>A 30% fatty acid amide (cocoamide DEA solution) was a moderate skin irritant in rabbits.

This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health).

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Prolonged or chronic exposure to alkanolamines may result in liver, kidney or nervous system injury. Repeated inhalation may aggravate asthma and inflammatory or fibrotic pulmonary disease.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Results of repeated exposure tests with diethanolamine (DEA) in laboratory animals include anaemia (rats) and effects on the kidneys (rats and mice) and liver (mice). DEA produces nervous system injury in dogs and rats. Heart and salivary gland lesions have also been seen in mice treated cutaneously with DEA and in mice receiving DEA in drinking water. Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids. They are excreted predominantly unchanged with a half-life of approximately one week. In the absence of sodium nitrite, no conversion to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines was observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Diethanolamine competitively inhibits the cellular uptake of choline, in vitro, and hepatic changes in choline homeostasis, consistent with choline deficiency, are observed in vivo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Many amines are potent skin and respiratory sensitisers and certain individuals especially those described as \"atopic\" (i.e. those predisposed to asthma and other allergic responses) may show allergic reactions when chronically exposed to alkanolamines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In a study with coconut diethanolamide, the National Toxicology Program (Technical Report Series 479), showed clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic and renal tubule neoplasms and in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis in males and females, ulcer in males, and parakeratosis and inflammation in females at the site of application and of follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland of males and females, were chemical related.</p>",
