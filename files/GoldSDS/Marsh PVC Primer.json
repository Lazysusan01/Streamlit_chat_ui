                "Environment": "<p>For tetrahydrofuran (THF):</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b>\u00a0Acute short term toxic environmental effects of THF may include the death of animals, birds, fish and death or low growth rate in plants. Acute effects are seen 2 to 4 days after animals or plants are exposed to tetrahydrofuran.</p> <p>Chronic toxic effects include shortened life span, reproductive problems, lowered fertility, and changes in appearance or behaviour in exposed animals. These effects have been seen long after the first exposure(s).</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b>\u00a0Tetrahydrofuran is slightly persistent in water with a half-life of between 2 to 20 days. Tetrahydrofuran is not expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. The concentration of tetrahydrofuran is edible fish tissue is expected to be negligible as compared to the levels found in the water from which the fish was taken.</p> <p>If tetrahydrofuran should contact the water table, aquifer or navigable waterway, time is of the essence. It is highly soluble in water and total remediation may not be possible. A comprehensive emergency response or disaster preparedness/ recovery plan should be in place prior to use.</p> <p>Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13.1 hrs and 6.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolysable functional groups</p> <p>If released to air, a vapor pressure of 162 mm Hg at 25 deg C indicates tetrahydrofuran will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetrahydrofuran will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl and nitrate radicals; the half-life for these reactions in air are about 1 and 3 days, respectively. Tetrahydrofuran is moderately reactive in photochemical smog conditions where nitrogen oxides are present; reactions occur in time scales of hours. Acrolein and formaldehyde have been reported as reaction products.\u00a0</p> <p>If released to soil, tetrahydrofuran is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 23 and 18. Volatilisation from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.1X10-5 atm-m3/mole. Tetrahydrofuran may volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Tetrahydrofuran added to surface soil had an abiotic half-life of 5.7 days. If released into water, tetrahydrofuran is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Tetrahydrofuran is expected to biodegrade under aerobic conditions but may be resistant to biodegradation in anaerobic environments. In the modified MITI screening test, tetrahydrofuran at 30 mg/l was completely biodegraded in 14 days using an activated sludge inoculum. Tetrahydrofuran at 50 mg C/l was resistant to anaerobic biodegradation with a lag period of greater than 60 days using a primary digesting sludge as an inoculum.\u00a0.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|log Kow  : 0.32-0.46|Half-life (hr) air  : 38.4|Half-life (hr) H2O surface water  : 1.57|Half-life (hr) soil  : 1.5|Henrys atm m3 /mol: 9.63E-03|Toxicity Fish: LC50(96)0.23-34.9mg/L|Fathead minnow LC50 (96 h): 2160 mg/L|Toxicity invertebrate: LC50 (96 h); 0.02-0.1mg/L|Bioaccumulation  : little|Effects on algae and plankton: LC50(6)algae 0.1mg/L",

This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Repeated exposure to tetrahydrofuran (THF) and its congeners has been associated with cytolytic hepatitis and fatty degeneration of the liver. Inhalation of THF at concentrations greater than 3000 ppm, 8 hours/day for 20 days, produced irritation and evidence for hepatic and renal injury in animals. Male rats inhaling more than 5000 ppm THF for 12 weeks, 4 hours/day showed signs of systemic intoxication, skin and respiratory irritation, liver function disturbance and abnormalities in glucose function. Muscle acetylcholinesterase activity increased in a concentration-dependent manner in male rats that inhaled 200 ppm for 18 weeks, 6 hours/day. Hepatic protein and mixed function oxidase activity also increased. At 2000 ppm, liver function was inhibited. In a 13-week inhalation study, ataxia was reported in rats at 5000 ppm and narcosis in mice at 1800 ppm. Hepatocytomegaly developed in mice of both sexes at 5000 ppm while uterine atrophy and degeneration of the adrenal cortex was found in female mice. A case history suggests that interaction of THF and endoflurane (an anaesthetic) may provoke epileptic seizures following surgery. The parent compound of tetrahydrofuran, furan, is carcinogenic in rats based on an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukaemia. In male and female mice, furan induced hepatocellular neoplasms and benign pheochromocytomas of the of the adrenal gland. 1,4-Dioxane, another cyclic ether solvent, is carcinogenic in rats and guinea pigs, following oral administration, inducing malignant tumours of the liver in rats and malignant tumours of the liver of the gall-bladder in guinea pigs. 1,4-Dioxane is a promoter in two stage skin carcinogenic studies in mice. In a two-year inhalation study * there was evidence of carcinogenic activity of THF, in male rats, based on increased incidences of renal tube adenoma or carcinoma (combined) and in female mice based on an increased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats or male mice exposed to 200, 600 and 1800 ppm THF by inhalation. * National Toxicology Program Technical Report Series No. 475</p> <p>Cyclic ethers, including tetrahydrofuran, furan and 1,4-dioxane, produce neoplasms and carcinomas in experimental animals, typically of the liver; other target organs include the adrenal gland, nasal cavity and gall-bladder. 1,4-Dioxane was a promoter in a two-stage skin carcinogenic study in mice. Results of studies with cyclic ethers indicate that carcinogenicity is often species and sex dependent. Furan has been used to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). \u00a0Oxetanes are under investigation.</p>",

Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of methyl ethyl ketone from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is also expected given the measured Henry's Law constant of 4.7x10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The volatilisation half-life of methyl ethyl ketone from silt and sandy loams was measured as 4.9 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as indicated by numerous screening tests.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: Based on Koc values, methyl ethyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 and 197, hours respectively. Biodegradation of this compound is expected based upon numerous screening tests. An estimated BCF value of 1 based on an experimental log Kow of 0.29, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, methyl ethyl ketone, which has an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C, will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase methyl ethyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is also expected to undergo photodecomposition in the atmosphere by natural sunlight. Photochemical degradation of methyl ethyl ketone by natural sunlight is expected to occur at approximately 1/5 the rate of degradation by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 1690-5640 mg/l; guppy (Lebistes reticulatus) 5700 mg/l; goldfish (Carassius auratus) &gt;5000 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 3200 mg/l; bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 4467 mg/l; mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) 5600 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h):&lt;520-1382 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (24 h): 8890 mg/l</p> <p>Brine shrimp (Artemia salina) LC50 (24 h): 1950 mg/l</p> <p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

On soil surfaces and in water, cyclohexanone is expected to be  eliminated by volatilisation, photolysis, and biodegradation. Based on  the low Koc, this material is considered to be highly mobile in soil.  Fugacity level Ib environmental modeling indicates that cyclohexanone  will partition almost exclusively to the air (31%) and water (69%). .  The low octanol/water coefficient suggests that cyclohexanone is  unlikely to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms; therefore, potential  for secondary poisoning is low.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 720-1100 mg/L</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Experimentally,  cyclohexanone has exhibited low acute toxicity towards freshwater fish  species and the microcrustacean Daphnia magna, slight acute toxicity to  algae and protozoa, and moderate acute toxicity to bacteria.</span></p> <p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water. They are unlikely to bioconcentrate or biomagnify.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Cyclohexanone vapour irritates the nose, throat and eyes at concentrations of 50 ppm.</p> <p>Histological examination of the lungs of mice that had been exposed at 4730 ppm of cyclohexanone for two hours showed congestion, oedema and focal to diffuse haemorrhage of the lung parenchyma. A 6 hour exposure of guinea pigs at 4000 ppm resulted in narcosis, hypothermia, and decreased respiration. Recovery from narcosis was slow and 3 out of 10 guinea pigs originally exposed, died within 4 days of the exposure.</p> <p>Rabbits exposed at 190 ppm for 50 daily, 6 hour exposures showed barely demonstrable degenerative changes in liver and kidney. Similar exposures at 309 ppm produced slight conjunctival irritation, at 1414 ppm lethargy and at 3082 ppm, incoordination, salivation, laboured breathing, narcosis and death.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Exposure to ketone vapours may produce nose, throat and mucous membrane irritation. High concentrations of vapour may produce central nervous system depression characterised by headache, vertigo, loss of coordination, narcosis and cardiorespiratory failure. Some ketones produce neurological disorders (polyneuropathy) characterised by bilateral symmetrical paresthesia and muscle weakness primarily in the legs and arms.</p>",

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Undiluted cyclohexanone placed in the eyes of rabbits produced marked irritation and some corneal injury</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p>"
