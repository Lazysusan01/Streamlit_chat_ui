The potential for volatilisation of ethanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mmHg.

Hydrolysis and photolysis in sunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for ethanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse or absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Structurally, 3 of the 4 substances in this category are\u00a0<i>alpha,beta</i>-unsaturated aldehydes. These substances have an oxidisable aldehyde function and an allylic position (C4) labile to attack by hydroxy radical species in the gas phase. The known chemical reactivity of these substrates supports short photodegradation half-lives predicted by the model.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>No hydrolysis is possible for any of these 4 cinnamaldehyde derivatives. All four are expected to be relatively stable in aqueous solution, although they may be slowly oxidized to the corresponding cinnamic acid derivative in aqueous media.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Studies for\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde demonstrate these materials to be readily biodegradable. Biodegradation of\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde was 70.5% and 90% after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B and 301F, respectively. Similarly,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde was 76.5% and 97% biodegraded after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B \u00a0and 301F, respectively and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde was 84% and 96% biodegraded after 28 days using test OECD guideline 301F. The three cinnamyl derivatives met the 10 day window criteria for biodegradability. Although no biodegradation study is available for cinnamaldehyde, this substance, like the other three cinnamaldehyde derivatives contains an oxidisable aldehyde function.</p> <p><b>Fugacity:</b>\u00a0Transport and distribution in the environmental were modeled using Level 1 Fugacity based Environmental Equilibrium Partitioning Model Version 2.11: Based on the comparable physiochemical properties of the four aldehydes, it is not unexpected that the four would exhibit similar distribution in the environment. The significance of these calculations must be evaluated in the context that the substances in this chemical category are readily oxidized in the environment to corresponding carboxylic acids. The aldehydes have been shown to be readily and/or ultimately biodegradable, and the remainder would be expected to behave similarly in the environment.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The 96-hour calculated LC50 for cinnamaldehyde is calculated to be 11.9 mg/L while the alkyl substituted homologues\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, being more lipophilic, are calculated to have LC50 values about one third of that for cinnamaldehyde (3.14 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The remaining substance\u00a0<i>p-t-butyl-alpha-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde\u00a0</i>possessing the same molecular weight as\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and is also an alkyl substituted cinnamaldehyde is calculated to have approximately the same LC50 (LD50=3.19 mg/L).</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): cinnamaldehyde 81. mg/L (calculated).</p> <p>The Daphnia 48-hour LC50s for the more lipophilic substances\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>hexylcinnamaldehyde are calculated to be 0.416 and 0.224 mg/L, respectively. The calculated LC50 for\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde is in the same range, 0.403 mg/L.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

They recommend the  limits  for  the  11  different  product  categories,  which  are  the  acceptable  use  levels  of  alpha-amyl  cinnamic aldehyde  in  the  various  product  categories. These  were  derived  from  the application  of  the  exposure-based quantitative  risk  assessment  approach  for  fragrance  ingredients.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The material has<b>\u00a0NOT</b>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by inhalation\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. In the absence of such evidence, care should be taken nevertheless to ensure exposure is kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used, in an occupational setting to control vapours, fumes and aerosols.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Biodegradation of\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde was 70.5% and 90% after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B and 301F, respectively. Similarly,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde was 76.5% and 97% biodegraded after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B \u00a0and 301F, respectively and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde was 84% and 96% biodegraded after 28 days using test OECD guideline 301F. The three cinnamyl derivatives met the 10 day window criteria for biodegradability. Although no biodegradation study is available for cinnamaldehyde, this substance, like the other three cinnamaldehyde derivatives contains an oxidisable aldehyde function.</p> <p><b>Fugacity:</b>\u00a0Transport and distribution in the environmental were modeled using Level 1 Fugacity based Environmental Equilibrium Partitioning Model Version 2.11: Based on the comparable physiochemical properties of the four aldehydes, it is not unexpected that the four would exhibit similar distribution in the environment. The significance of these calculations must be evaluated in the context that the substances in this chemical category are readily oxidized in the environment to corresponding carboxylic acids. The aldehydes have been shown to be readily and/or ultimately biodegradable, and the remainder would be expected to behave similarly in the environment.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The 96-hour calculated LC50 for cinnamaldehyde is calculated to be 11.9 mg/L while the alkyl substituted homologues\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, being more lipophilic, are calculated to have LC50 values about one third of that for cinnamaldehyde (3.14 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The remaining substance\u00a0<i>p-t-butyl-alpha-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde\u00a0</i>possessing the same molecular weight as\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and is also an alkyl substituted cinnamaldehyde is calculated to have approximately the same LC50 (LD50=3.19 mg/L).</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): cinnamaldehyde 81. mg/L (calculated).</p> <p>The Daphnia 48-hour LC50s for the more lipophilic substances\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>hexylcinnamaldehyde are calculated to be 0.416 and 0.224 mg/L, respectively. The calculated LC50 for\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde is in the same range, 0.403 mg/L.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|Biodegradation: 9%|TOC 32%",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>IFRA Restricted Fragrance Substance</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) Standards form the\r\nbasis for the globally accepted and recognized risk management system for the\r\nsafe use of fragrance ingredients and are part of the IFRA Code of Practice.\r\nThis is the self-regulating system of the industry, based on risk assessments\r\ncarried out by an independent Expert Panel.</span></p> #The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) believe that BMHCA is not safe for use as fragrance ingredient in cosmetic leave-on and rinse-off type products, neither at concentration limits according to the ones set up by IFRA in 2013 (MoS = 3.6) nor at concentration limits as set up by IFRA in the revised proposal that has been submitted in 2015 belatedly (MoS = 53). In addition, no firm conclusion could be drawn on mutagenicity. The committee also concluded that BMHCA poses a risk of inducing skin sensitisation in humans.#The   IFRA Standard   for is   based   on   a   concern   for sensitization  potential  due  to  the  presence  of  structural  alerts,  the  fact  that structurally  similar  materials  are sensitizers, and the lack of sensitization test data on this material.#The RIFM Expert Panel recommends the limits for the 11 different product categories, which are the acceptable use levels of m-BMHCA in the various product categories.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Hydrolysis of geranyl acetate and neryl acetate is expected both\u00a0<i>in\u00a0</i>vivo and in the environment. The second major constituent of acetylated myrcene, limen, will not hydrolyse in water. The significance of calculated half-life data for geranyl acetate must take into account the experimental data that aliphatic ester, in general, are readily hydrolysed in fish.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Duplicate studies on citronellol and geraniol show these materials to be readily biodegradable (<i>i.e.,\u00a0</i>100% biodegradation [OECD 301B, OECD 301C]. Likewise, a mixture of geranial and neral (citral) exhibits greater than 92% \u00a0and 99.5% biodegradation. Nerol is a stereoisomer of geraniol and would likewise be expected to be readily biodegradable. Geranyl acetate has also been shown to be readily biodegradable (greater than 82% biodegradation) and, therefore, neryl acetate would be as well. The other significant constituent of acetylated myrcene, limen, has not been shown to be readily biodegradable. However, since limen makes up only 10% of the mixture, a ready biodegradation test of the mixture is expected to result in apparent ready biodegradation.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>Terpenes and their oxygen-containing counterparts, the terpenoids, produce a variety of physiological effects. Pine oil monoterpenes, for example, produce a haemorrhagic gastritis characterised by stomach pain and bleeding and vomiting. \u00a0Systemic effects of pine oils include weakness and central nervous depression, excitement, loss of balance, headache, with hypothermia and respiratory failure.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>|Vomiting, shock, cyanosis and convulsions preceded death in a child who consumed an unknown quantity of a preparation consisting mainly of &quot;oil of citronella&quot;. Gastric mucosa was found to be severely damaged. By stomach tube citronellol produced paralysis, coma, death in doses of|about 1-4 ml/kg in rabbits.",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Structurally, 3 of the 4 substances in this category are\u00a0<i>alpha,beta</i>-unsaturated aldehydes. These substances have an oxidisable aldehyde function and an allylic position (C4) labile to attack by hydroxy radical species in the gas phase. The known chemical reactivity of these substrates supports short photodegradation half-lives predicted by the model.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>No hydrolysis is possible for any of these 4 cinnamaldehyde derivatives. All four are expected to be relatively stable in aqueous solution, although they may be slowly oxidized to the corresponding cinnamic acid derivative in aqueous media.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Studies for\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde demonstrate these materials to be readily biodegradable. Biodegradation of\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde was 70.5% and 90% after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B and 301F, respectively. Similarly,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde was 76.5% and 97% biodegraded after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B \u00a0and 301F, respectively and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde was 84% and 96% biodegraded after 28 days using test OECD guideline 301F. The three cinnamyl derivatives met the 10 day window criteria for biodegradability. Although no biodegradation study is available for cinnamaldehyde, this substance, like the other three cinnamaldehyde derivatives contains an oxidisable aldehyde function.</p> <p><b>Fugacity:</b>\u00a0Transport and distribution in the environmental were modeled using Level 1 Fugacity based Environmental Equilibrium Partitioning Model Version 2.11: Based on the comparable physiochemical properties of the four aldehydes, it is not unexpected that the four would exhibit similar distribution in the environment. The significance of these calculations must be evaluated in the context that the substances in this chemical category are readily oxidized in the environment to corresponding carboxylic acids. The aldehydes have been shown to be readily and/or ultimately biodegradable, and the remainder would be expected to behave similarly in the environment.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The 96-hour calculated LC50 for cinnamaldehyde is calculated to be 11.9 mg/L while the alkyl substituted homologues\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, being more lipophilic, are calculated to have LC50 values about one third of that for cinnamaldehyde (3.14 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The remaining substance\u00a0<i>p-t-butyl-alpha-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde\u00a0</i>possessing the same molecular weight as\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and is also an alkyl substituted cinnamaldehyde is calculated to have approximately the same LC50 (LD50=3.19 mg/L).</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): cinnamaldehyde 81. mg/L (calculated).</p> <p>The Daphnia 48-hour LC50s for the more lipophilic substances\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>hexylcinnamaldehyde are calculated to be 0.416 and 0.224 mg/L, respectively. The calculated LC50 for\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde is in the same range, 0.403 mg/L.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>IFRA Restricted Fragrance Substance</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) Standards form the\r\nbasis for the globally accepted and recognized risk management system for the\r\nsafe use of fragrance ingredients and are part of the IFRA Code of Practice.\r\nThis is the self-regulating system of the industry, based on risk assessments\r\ncarried out by an independent Expert Panel.</span></p> #The RIFM Expert Panel reviewed the critical effect data for alpha-hexyl cinnamic aldehyde and, based on the weight of evidence, established the No Expected Sensitization Induction Level (NESIL) as 23600 ug/cm2.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The material has<b>\u00a0NOT</b>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by inhalation\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. In the absence of such evidence, care should be taken nevertheless to ensure exposure is kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used, in an occupational setting to control vapours, fumes and aerosols.</p><p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cinnamaldehyde is quite sensitive to small amounts of oxygen The autoxidation of cinnamic aldehyde prouces an acid \u00a0even when samples are stored in tightly capped bottles with the head space flushed with nitrogen.
