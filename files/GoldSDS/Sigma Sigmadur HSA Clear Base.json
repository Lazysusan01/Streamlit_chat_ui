Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints.

At present, little is known\r\nabout their additional hormonal activities in different hormonal receptor\r\nsystems despite their increasing use and environmental persistence. Besides\r\nestrogenic activity, UV filters may have additional activities, both agonistic\r\nand antagonistic in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Systematic analysis of the oestrogenic, antioestrogenic,\r\nandrogenic, and antiandrogenic activity was conducted using 18 UV filters and\r\none metabolite\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0at non-cytotoxic concentrations with\r\nrecombinant yeast systems carrying either a human estrogen (hER) or androgen\r\nreceptor (hAR). All 19 compounds elicited hormonal activities, surprisingly\r\nmost of them multiple activities. Ten UV-filters having agonistic effects\r\ntowards the hER. Surprisingly, six UV filters with androgenic activities and\r\nmany of them having pronounced antioestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities.\r\nSeventeen compounds inhibited 4,5-dihydrotestosterone activity in the hAR\r\nassay, while 14 compounds inhibited oestradiol activity in the hER assay,\r\nindicating antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, respectively. In\r\nparticular, the antiandrogenic activities of phenyl- and benzyl salicylate,\r\nbenzophenone-1 and -2, and of 4-hydroxybenzophenone were higher than that of\r\nflutamide, a known hAR antagonist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although most of the UV filters exert hormonal effects at\r\nconcentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in the environment,\r\nwide distribution and exposure to UV filter mixtures may have environmental\r\nconsequences due to additive effects. The UV filters 4-methylbenzylidene\r\ncamphor, benzophenone-3, \u00a0benzophenone-4, octyl methoxycinnamate,\r\noctocrylene and homosalate that repeatedly were detected in the aquatic\r\nenvironment, may contribute with their multiple hormonal activities in a\r\ncomplex manner to the mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals already present\r\nin surface water and fish. For most of the UV filters with multiple hormonal\r\nactivities residues in the aquatic environment and in biota are not yet known,\r\nand therefore their environmental relevance remains elusive. The fact that all\r\n18 UV filters and one metabolite showed receptor ligand binding via\r\ntransactivation \u2013 surprisingly most of them multiple bindings \u2013 reveals a\r\ncomplex picture of the hormonal activities of UV filters</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petra Kunz and Karl Fent: Aquatic Toxicology Vol 79 pp 305-324\r\nOctober 2006</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|Readily biodegradable|Ecotoxicity:|Fish LC0 (96 h): &gt;10000 mg/l|Daphnia ECo: 3.6 mg/l",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

One\r\nmechanism proposed involves the development of free radicals following UVB\r\nabsorption by the chemical agent; free radicals are potentially damaging to\r\nDNA.\u00a0 A further mechanism involves the inhibition of Vitamin D production; low\r\nlevels of Vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of the development\r\nof breast and colon cancer and may also accelerate the growth of melanoma.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While sunscreens have been\r\neffective in protecting against a variety of UV-related pathologies, such as\r\nsunburns, actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas\u00a0 growing\r\npopularity and thus, possibility for exposure questions their safety in\r\nenvironment and human health. Available data imply, that sunscreen compounds\r\nmight block vitamin D synthesis or act as endocrine disruptor and lead to\r\ndevelopmental toxicity. The effects of sunscreen on cutaneous synthesis of\r\nvitamin D induced by sunlight have been a subject of debate, however the newest\r\nanalysis suggests, that normal usage of sunscreen by adults do not decrease\r\ncutaneous synthesis of vitamin D . The endocrine disruptive and developmental\r\ntoxicity of many organic UV filters in experimental models is well established,\r\nthese filters seem to be associated with altered estrogen, androgen and\r\nprogesterone activity, reproductive and developmental toxicity and impaired\r\nfunctioning of the thyroid, liver or kidneys, reviewed elsewhere.\u00a0 Since many\r\nof UV filters were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the risk for\r\nneurotoxicity also occurs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Organic or chemical filters are\r\nthe most popular and widely used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.\r\nOrganic filters can be classified by the type of ultraviolet (UV) radiation\r\nthey absorb, namely UVB, UVA or UVB-UVA filters. The main route of human\r\nexposure is dermal absorption, however other routes and environmental exposure\r\nshould be also considered. The last is particularly true for organic filters,\r\nwhich, due to their high lipophilicity could bioaccumulate in aquatic organism\r\nand reach humans through the food chain. Thus, they also are emergent as an\r\nenvironmental pollutant. Chemical UV filters are easily absorbed by the skin\r\nand reach the systemic circulation, and accumulate in various tissues, as\r\nadipose tissue, liver and the brain. Their lipophilicity permits them to\r\nreadily cross the BBB. There is a wide range of in vitro and in vivo studies of\r\nthe toxic effects of UV filters as endocrine disruptors. Since it is known that\r\nother chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors can impair neuronal\r\ntransmission, synaptic plasticity and produce neurotoxic effects [ chemical\r\nfilters might potentially produce similar effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Inorganic (physical) ingredients\r\nused in modern sunscreens include metal oxide particles, typically titanium\r\ndioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), which occurs typically at 5-10%\r\nconcentration (maximum allowed is 25%). While chemical filters still dominate\r\nin sunscreen products, the usage of physical compounds is constantly growing.\r\nOne of the reasons is that they have a higher spectrum of protection - TiO2 is\r\nvery effective in absorbing UVB, while ZnO absorbs mainly the UVA range, and\r\nthe combination of both particles provides a broad UV protection. Other\r\nadvantages of physical filters are lack of skin sensitization and limited skin\r\npenetration. However, these mineral filters, when in normal pigment size range\r\n(200-400 nm for ZnO, 150-300 nm for TiO2) have poor particle dispersion, which\r\nmakes them difficult to apply; they also reflect and scatter light, which\r\nresult in undesirable visible white film on the skin. With nanotechnology,\r\nthese materials can be reduced to nanoparticles (NPs) (&lt;100 nm) which are\r\neasier to apply and are transparent on the skin . Nevertheless, with\r\nmicronization some properties are changed - they may be more bioreactive and\r\neasier penetrate the skin and other tissues, leading to concerns about their\r\nsafety use. Moreover, part of the absorbed UV radiation can generate free\r\nradicals on the surface of metal oxides in the presence of water and this\r\nphotocatalytic activity increases with decreasing NPs size. NP-induced cyto-\r\nand genotoxicity has been associated with increased photocatalytic activity,\r\nleading to increased production of free radicals</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>",

At present, little is known\r\nabout their additional hormonal activities in different hormonal receptor\r\nsystems despite their increasing use and environmental persistence. Besides\r\nestrogenic activity, UV filters may have additional activities, both agonistic\r\nand antagonistic in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Systematic analysis of the oestrogenic, antioestrogenic,\r\nandrogenic, and antiandrogenic activity was conducted using 18 UV filters and\r\none metabolite\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0at non-cytotoxic concentrations with\r\nrecombinant yeast systems carrying either a human estrogen (hER) or androgen\r\nreceptor (hAR). All 19 compounds elicited hormonal activities, surprisingly\r\nmost of them multiple activities. Ten UV-filters having agonistic effects\r\ntowards the hER. Surprisingly, six UV filters with androgenic activities and\r\nmany of them having pronounced antioestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities.\r\nSeventeen compounds inhibited 4,5-dihydrotestosterone activity in the hAR\r\nassay, while 14 compounds inhibited oestradiol activity in the hER assay,\r\nindicating antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, respectively. In\r\nparticular, the antiandrogenic activities of phenyl- and benzyl salicylate,\r\nbenzophenone-1 and -2, and of 4-hydroxybenzophenone were higher than that of\r\nflutamide, a known hAR antagonist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although most of the UV filters exert hormonal effects at\r\nconcentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in the environment,\r\nwide distribution and exposure to UV filter mixtures may have environmental\r\nconsequences due to additive effects. The UV filters 4-methylbenzylidene\r\ncamphor, benzophenone-3, \u00a0benzophenone-4, octyl methoxycinnamate,\r\noctocrylene and homosalate that repeatedly were detected in the aquatic\r\nenvironment, may contribute with their multiple hormonal activities in a\r\ncomplex manner to the mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals already present\r\nin surface water and fish. For most of the UV filters with multiple hormonal\r\nactivities residues in the aquatic environment and in biota are not yet known,\r\nand therefore their environmental relevance remains elusive. The fact that all\r\n18 UV filters and one metabolite showed receptor ligand binding via\r\ntransactivation \u2013 surprisingly most of them multiple bindings \u2013 reveals a\r\ncomplex picture of the hormonal activities of UV filters</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petra Kunz and Karl Fent: Aquatic Toxicology Vol 79 pp 305-324\r\nOctober 2006</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments The liquid may produce considerable gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful or toxic if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted.

Volatilisation of n-butyl acetate is expected from moist soil surfaces given its Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilisation from dry soil surfaces is expected based on a measured vapor pressure of 11.5 mm Hg. Using a standard BOD dilution technique and a sewage inoculum, theoretical BODs of 56 % to 86 % were observed during 5-20 day incubation periods, which suggests that n-butyl acetate may biodegrade in soil.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value indicates that n-butyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Butyl acetate is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on a Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 127, hours respectively. An estimated BCF value of 10 based on the log Kow, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using a filtered sewage seed, 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 58 % and 83 % were measured in freshwater dilution tests; 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 40 % and 61 % were measured in salt water. A 5-day theoretical BOD of 56.8 % and 51.8 % were measured for n-butyl acetate in distilled water and seawater, respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate for this compound based upon experimentally determined hydrolysis half-lives of 114 and 11 days at pH 8 and 9 respectively.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, n-butyl acetate, which has a vapour pressure of 11.5 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase n-butyl acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 4 days</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h, 23 C): island silverside (Menidia beryllina) 185 ppm (static bioassay in synthetic seawater, mild aeration applied after 24 h); bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 100 ppm (static bioassay in fresh water, mild aeration applied after 24 h)</p> <p>Fish EC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 18 mg/l (affected fish lost equilibrium prior to death)\u00a0</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (48 h): 44 ppm</p> <p>Algal LC50 (96 h): Scenedesmus 320 ppm</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p>"

                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>No exposure limits set by NOHSC or ACGIH</p> #CEL TWA: 50 ppm, 320 mg/m3  (as heptyl acetate)   [Manufacturer]",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
