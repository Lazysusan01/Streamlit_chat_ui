All four are expected to be relatively stable in aqueous solution, although they may be slowly oxidized to the corresponding cinnamic acid derivative in aqueous media.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Studies for\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde demonstrate these materials to be readily biodegradable. Biodegradation of\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde was 70.5% and 90% after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B and 301F, respectively. Similarly,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde was 76.5% and 97% biodegraded after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B \u00a0and 301F, respectively and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde was 84% and 96% biodegraded after 28 days using test OECD guideline 301F. The three cinnamyl derivatives met the 10 day window criteria for biodegradability. Although no biodegradation study is available for cinnamaldehyde, this substance, like the other three cinnamaldehyde derivatives contains an oxidisable aldehyde function.</p> <p><b>Fugacity:</b>\u00a0Transport and distribution in the environmental were modeled using Level 1 Fugacity based Environmental Equilibrium Partitioning Model Version 2.11: Based on the comparable physiochemical properties of the four aldehydes, it is not unexpected that the four would exhibit similar distribution in the environment. The significance of these calculations must be evaluated in the context that the substances in this chemical category are readily oxidized in the environment to corresponding carboxylic acids. The aldehydes have been shown to be readily and/or ultimately biodegradable, and the remainder would be expected to behave similarly in the environment.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The 96-hour calculated LC50 for cinnamaldehyde is calculated to be 11.9 mg/L while the alkyl substituted homologues\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, being more lipophilic, are calculated to have LC50 values about one third of that for cinnamaldehyde (3.14 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The remaining substance\u00a0<i>p-t-butyl-alpha-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde\u00a0</i>possessing the same molecular weight as\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and is also an alkyl substituted cinnamaldehyde is calculated to have approximately the same LC50 (LD50=3.19 mg/L).</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): cinnamaldehyde 81. mg/L (calculated).</p> <p>The Daphnia 48-hour LC50s for the more lipophilic substances\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>hexylcinnamaldehyde are calculated to be 0.416 and 0.224 mg/L, respectively. The calculated LC50 for\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde is in the same range, 0.403 mg/L.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

They recommend the  limits  for  the  11  different  product  categories,  which  are  the  acceptable  use  levels  of  alpha-amyl  cinnamic aldehyde  in  the  various  product  categories. These  were  derived  from  the application  of  the  exposure-based quantitative  risk  assessment  approach  for  fragrance  ingredients.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>IFRA Restricted Fragrance Substance</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) Standards form the\r\nbasis for the globally accepted and recognized risk management system for the\r\nsafe use of fragrance ingredients and are part of the IFRA Code of Practice.\r\nThis is the self-regulating system of the industry, based on risk assessments\r\ncarried out by an independent Expert Panel.</span></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The material has<b>\u00a0NOT</b>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by inhalation\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. In the absence of such evidence, care should be taken nevertheless to ensure exposure is kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used, in an occupational setting to control vapours, fumes and aerosols.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p>",

Structurally, 3 of the 4 substances in this category are\u00a0<i>alpha,beta</i>-unsaturated aldehydes. These substances have an oxidisable aldehyde function and an allylic position (C4) labile to attack by hydroxy radical species in the gas phase. The known chemical reactivity of these substrates supports short photodegradation half-lives predicted by the model.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>No hydrolysis is possible for any of these 4 cinnamaldehyde derivatives. All four are expected to be relatively stable in aqueous solution, although they may be slowly oxidized to the corresponding cinnamic acid derivative in aqueous media.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Studies for\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde demonstrate these materials to be readily biodegradable. Biodegradation of\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde was 70.5% and 90% after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B and 301F, respectively. Similarly,\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde was 76.5% and 97% biodegraded after 28 days using OECD test guidelines 301B \u00a0and 301F, respectively and\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde was 84% and 96% biodegraded after 28 days using test OECD guideline 301F. The three cinnamyl derivatives met the 10 day window criteria for biodegradability. Although no biodegradation study is available for cinnamaldehyde, this substance, like the other three cinnamaldehyde derivatives contains an oxidisable aldehyde function.</p> <p><b>Fugacity:</b>\u00a0Transport and distribution in the environmental were modeled using Level 1 Fugacity based Environmental Equilibrium Partitioning Model Version 2.11: Based on the comparable physiochemical properties of the four aldehydes, it is not unexpected that the four would exhibit similar distribution in the environment. The significance of these calculations must be evaluated in the context that the substances in this chemical category are readily oxidized in the environment to corresponding carboxylic acids. The aldehydes have been shown to be readily and/or ultimately biodegradable, and the remainder would be expected to behave similarly in the environment.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The 96-hour calculated LC50 for cinnamaldehyde is calculated to be 11.9 mg/L while the alkyl substituted homologues\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-hexylcinnamaldehyde, being more lipophilic, are calculated to have LC50 values about one third of that for cinnamaldehyde (3.14 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The remaining substance\u00a0<i>p-t-butyl-alpha-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde\u00a0</i>possessing the same molecular weight as\u00a0<i>alpha</i>amylcinnamaldehyde and is also an alkyl substituted cinnamaldehyde is calculated to have approximately the same LC50 (LD50=3.19 mg/L).</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): cinnamaldehyde 81. mg/L (calculated).</p> <p>The Daphnia 48-hour LC50s for the more lipophilic substances\u00a0<i>alpha</i>-amylcinnamaldehyde and\u00a0<i>alpha</i>hexylcinnamaldehyde are calculated to be 0.416 and 0.224 mg/L, respectively. The calculated LC50 for\u00a0<i>p-t-</i>butyl<i>-alpha-</i>methylhydrocinnamaldehyde is in the same range, 0.403 mg/L.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|Biodegradation: 9%|TOC 32%",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The material has<b>\u00a0NOT</b>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by inhalation\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. In the absence of such evidence, care should be taken nevertheless to ensure exposure is kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used, in an occupational setting to control vapours, fumes and aerosols.</p><p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cinnamaldehyde is quite sensitive to small amounts of oxygen The autoxidation of cinnamic aldehyde prouces an acid \u00a0even when samples are stored in tightly capped bottles with the head space flushed with nitrogen. Since cinnamic acid is white, its formation, which occurs within a short time after exposure, is not responsible for the yellowing of cinnamaldehyde. The intensity of the yellow color increases with time of oxygen exposure, rather than with the quantity of oxygen, indicating that more complex oxidation occurs during aging. Specifically, the formation of conjugated dienals are the intensive yellow components responsible for the discoloration and yellowing of the cinnamic aldehyde. This mechanism also seems to be applicable to other conjugateds unsaturated aldehydes such citral.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies with similar materials using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Aliphatic aldehydes may be dermal sensitisers.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Cinnamaldehyde is quite sensitive to small amounts of oxygen The autoxidation of cinnamic aldehyde prouces an acid \u00a0even when samples are stored in tightly capped bottles with the head space flushed with nitrogen. Since cinnamic acid is white, its formation, which occurs within a short time after exposure, is not responsible for the yellowing of cinnamaldehyde. The intensity of the yellow color increases with time of oxygen exposure, rather than with the quantity of oxygen, indicating that more complex oxidation occurs during aging. Specifically, the formation of conjugated dienals are the intensive yellow components responsible for the discoloration and yellowing of the cinnamic aldehyde. This mechanism also seems to be applicable to other conjugateds unsaturated aldehydes such citral.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",
