Has been used as preservative in cosmetics and toiletries.|The use of 2-bromo-2-nitropropan-1,3-diol in personal care products (cosmetics, toiletries) has declined since the late 1980s due to the potential formation of nitrosamines. While 2-bromo-2-nitropropan-1,3-diol is not in itself a nitrosating agent, under conditions where it decomposes (alkaline solution and/or elevated temperatures) it can liberate nitrite and low levels of formaldehyde and these decomposition products can react with any contaminant secondary amines or amides in a personal care formulation to produce significant levels of nitrosamines (due to the toxicity of these substances, the term significant means levels as low as 10s of parts per billion).|Manufacturers of personal care products are therefore instructed by regulatory authorities to avoid the formation of nitrosamines which might mean removing amines or amides from the formulation, removing Bronopol from a formulation, or using nitrosamine inhibitors.|[~Regeant ~]",

Bromide may be oxidised to produce hypobromous acid which in turn may react with natural organic matter to form brominated compounds. The formation of bromoform has been well documented, as has the formation of bromoacetic acids, bromopicrin, cyanogen bromide, and bromoacetone. Bromates may also be formed following ozonation or chlorination if pH is relatively high. Bromates may be animal carcinogens.</p> <p>Bromine reservoirs, such as HBr and BrONO2, are much more easily broken up by sunlight ; causing bromine to be from 10 to 100 times more effective than chlorine at destroying ozone.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.
