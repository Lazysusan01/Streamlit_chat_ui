Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p><span>For barium and its compounds::</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The length of time that barium will last in\r\nair, land, water, or sediments following release of barium into these media\r\ndepends on the form of barium released. Barium compounds that do not dissolve\r\nwell in water, such as barium sulfate and barium carbonate, can persist for a\r\nlong time in the environment. Barium compounds, such as barium chloride, barium\r\nnitrate, or barium hydroxide, that dissolve easily in water usually do not last\r\nin these forms for a long time in the environment. The barium in these\r\ncompounds that is dissolved in water quickly combines with sulfate or carbonate\r\nthat are naturally found in water and become the longer lasting forms (barium\r\nsulfate and barium carbonate). </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Under natural conditions, barium is stable\r\nin the +2 valence state and is found primarily in the form of inorganic\r\ncomplexes. Conditions such as pH, Eh (oxidation-reduction potential), cation\r\nexchange capacity, and the presence of sulfate, carbonate, and metal oxides\r\n(e.g., oxides of aluminum, manganese, silicon, and titanium) will affect the\r\npartitioning of barium and its compounds in the environment. The major features\r\nof the biogeochemical cycle of barium include wet and dry deposition to land\r\nand surface water, leaching from geological formations to groundwater,\r\nadsorption to soil and sediment particulates, and biomagnification in\r\nterrestrial and aquatic food chains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium is a highly reactive metal that\r\noccurs naturally only in a combined state. The element is released to\r\nenvironmental media by both natural processes and anthropogenic sources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The general population is exposed to barium\r\nthrough consumption of drinking water and foods, usually at low levels. Most\r\nbarium released to the environment from industrial sources is in forms that do\r\nnot become widely dispersed. In the atmosphere, barium is likely to be present\r\nin particulate form. Although chemical reactions may cause changes in\r\nspeciation of barium in air, the main mechanisms for the removal of barium\r\ncompounds from the atmosphere are likely to be wet and dry deposition.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>In aquatic media, barium is likely to\r\nprecipitate out of solution as an insoluble salt (i.e., as BaSO4 or BaCO3).\r\nWaterborne barium may also adsorb to suspended particulate matter through the\r\nformation of ion pairs with natural anions such as bicarbonate or sulfate in\r\nthe matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Precipitation of barium sulfate salts is\r\naccelerated when rivers enter the ocean because of the high sulfate content\r\n(905 mg/L) in the ocean. It is estimated that only 0.006% of the total barium\r\ninput into oceans from freshwater sources remains in solution. Sedimentation of\r\nsuspended solids removes a large portion of the barium content from surface\r\nwaters. There is evidence to suggest that the precipitation of barium from the\r\nsurface of fresh and marine waters occurs, in part, as the result of the barite\r\ncrystal formation in microorganisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium in sediments is found largely in the\r\nform of barium sulfate (barite). Coarse silt sediment in a turbulent\r\nenvironment will often grind and cleave the barium sulfate from the sediment\r\nparticles leaving a buildup of dense barites. Estimated soil:water distribution\r\ncoefficients (Kd) (i.e., the ratio of the quantity of barium sorbed per gram of\r\nsorbent to the concentration of barium remaining in solution at equilibrium)\r\nrange from 200 to 2,800 for sediments and sandy loam soils. The uptake of\r\nbarium by fish and marine organisms is also an important removal mechanism.\r\nBarium levels in sea water range from 2 to 63 \u00b5g/L with a mean concentration of\r\nabout 13 \u00b5g/L. Barium was found to bioconcentrate in marine plants by a factor\r\nof 400-4,000 times the level present in the water. Bioconcentration factors in\r\nmarine animals, plankton, and brown algae of 100, 120, and 260, respectively,\r\nhave been reported. In freshwater, a bioconcentration factor of 129 was\r\nestimated in fish where the barium in water was 0.07 mg/L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium added to soils (e.g., from the land\r\nfarming of waste drilling muds) may either be taken up by vegetation or\r\ntransported through soil with precipitation. Relative to the amount of barium\r\nfound in soils, little is typically bioconcentrated by plants. For example, a\r\nbioconcentration factor of 0.4 has been estimated for plants in a Virginia\r\nfloodplain with a barium soil concentration of 104.2 mg/kg . However, there are\r\nsome plants, such as legumes, forage plants, Brazil nuts, and mushrooms that\r\naccumulate barium. Bioconcentration factors from 2 to 20 have been reported for\r\ntomatoes and soybeans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barium is not very mobile in most soil\r\nsystems, due to the formation of water-insoluble salts and an inability of the\r\nbarium ion to form soluble complexes with fulvic and humic acids. The rate of\r\ntransportation of barium in soil is dependent on the characteristics of the\r\nsoil material. Soil properties that influence the transportation of barium to\r\ngroundwater are cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content and\r\npH. In soil with a high cation exchange capacity (e.g., fine textured mineral\r\nsoils or soils with high organic matter content), barium mobility will be\r\nlimited by adsorption. High CaCO3 content limits mobility by precipitation of\r\nthe element as BaCO3. Barium will also precipitate as barium sulfate in the\r\npresence of sulfate ions. Barium is more mobile and is more likely to be\r\nleached from soils in the presence of chloride due to the high solubility of\r\nbarium chloride as compared to other chemical forms of barium. Barium may become\r\nmore mobile in soils under acid conditions as barium in water-insoluble salts,\r\nsuch as barium sulfate and carbonate, becomes more soluble. Barium complexes\r\nwith fatty acids (e.g., in acidic landfill leachate) will be much more mobile\r\nin the soil due to the lower charge of these complexes and subsequent reduction\r\nin adsorption capacity.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material, during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Barium fumes are respiratory irritants.

These include gastric pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p> <p>Ingestion of soluble barium compounds may result in ulceration of the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract, tightness in the muscles of the face and neck, gastroenteritis, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscular tremors and paralysis, anxiety, weakness, laboured breathing, cardiac irregularity due to contractions of smooth, striated and cardiac muscles (often violent and painful), slow irregular pulse, hypertension, convulsions and respiratory failure.</p> <p>The predominant musculoskeletal effect observed in cases of barium toxicity in humans is progressive muscle weakness, often leading to partial or total paralysis. In severe cases, the paralysis affects the respiratory system. The likely cause of the muscle weakness was the barium-induced hypokalaemia (low potassium levels) rather than a direct effect on muscles.</p> <p>Numbness and tingling around the mouth and neck were sometimes among the first symptoms of barium toxicity in humans. Occasionally, these neurological symptoms extended to the extremities. Partial and complete paralysis occurred in severe cases, often accompanied by an absence of deep tendon reflexes</p> <p>Toxic effects on the kidneys have been observed in several adult cases of acute barium</p> <p>poisoning. Effects include hemoglobin in the urine (which may be indicative of kidney damage), renal insufficiency , degeneration of the kidneys, and acute renal failure.</p> <p>Studies in animals suggest that the kidney is a critical target of barium toxicity. An increase in relative kidney weight (kidney/brain weight ratio) was observed in male and female rats receiving a single gavage dose of 198 mg barium/kg/day as barium chloride in water.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acute exposure to presumably high doses of barium carbonate, barium sulfate, or barium chloride can result in serious effects on heart rhythm. Barium adversely affects cardiac automaticity resulting in ventricular tachycardia and other disruptions of rhythm. Hypotension has also been reported in some cases. The likely cause of these effects was barium-induced hypokalaemia.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Several human studies have investigated a possible association between exposure to low levels of barium and alterations in blood pressure and cardiac rhythms. In a small-scale (11 subjects) study of individuals exposed to 0.1 or 0.2 mg barium/kg/day as barium chloride in drinking water for 4 weeks, no significant alterations in blood pressure or ECG readings were found. There was no significant alteration in blood pressure measurements or alterations in hypertension, heart disease, or stroke among residents of two communities with elevated (0.2 mg barium/kg/day) or low (0.003 mg barium/kg/day) levels of barium in drinking water. Significantly higher mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and heart disease (arteriosclerosis) were found in the elevated barium communities (0.06-0.3 mg barium/kg/day) than in the low barium communities (0.006 mg barium/kg/day). The largest difference between the groups was in individuals 65 years of age and older. These results should be interpreted cautiously because the study did not control for a number of potential confounding variables such as the use of water softeners, which would reduce the amount of barium and increase sodium levels, duration of exposure, or actual barium intakes.</p> <p>\u00a0Several animal studies have examined potential cardiovascular end points following acute-, intermediate-, or chronic-duration exposures. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure were observed in rats exposed to 8.6 or 11 mg barium/kg/day for 1 or 4 months, respectively; no effect levels were 1.0 and 1.2 mg barium/kg/day. When the duration of exposure was longer (8-16 months), the LOAEL for increased blood pressure was 0.80 mg barium/kg/day and the NOAEL was 0.17 mg barium/kg/day. Depressed rates of cardiac contraction and cardiac conductivity and decreased cardiac ATP levels were observed in another group of rats exposed to 7.2 mg barium/kg/day. In contrast to the findings in this study, a second study could find no significant alterations in blood pressure were observed in rats exposed to up to 150 mg barium/kg/day in drinking water for 16 weeks; it should be noted that the second was conducted in uninephrectomized rats or Dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats. \u00a0NTP (1994) also found no significant alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG readings in rats exposed to 180 mg barium/kg/day for 45 or 90 days. The low metal diet used in the first study may have influenced the study outcome.</p> <p>\u00a0When evaluating the health effects of barium compounds, it is important to keep in mind that different barium compounds have different solubilities in water and body fluids and therefore serve as variable sources of the Ba2+ ion. The Ba2+ ion and the soluble compounds of barium (notably chloride, nitrate, and hydroxide) are generally highly toxic to humans and experimental animals. The insoluble barium compounds (notably sulfate) are inefficient sources of the Ba2+ ion and therefore are generally nontoxic. Although barium carbonate is insoluble in water, barium ions would be released from ingested barium carbonate in the acid milieu of the stomach.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>|Acute effects of ingestion include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, convulsions, muscular spasms and haemorrhage of the stomach, intestines and kidneys.|Lethal dose may be as little as 1 gm.|In test animals, acute doses have impaired the function of male and female reproductive organs.",
