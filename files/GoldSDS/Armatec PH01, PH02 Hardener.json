Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chemical burns of the gastrointestinal tract and scarring and stricture of the oesophagus were reported in the case of a patient who survived the ingestion of 60 gm. of a 2% solution.</p> <p>Symptoms of exposure may be delayed.</p> <p>Phthalates (aromatic dicarboxylic acid esters), in general, exhibit low toxicity, partly because of poor absorption but mainly as a result of rapid metabolism in which the esters are saponified to phthalic acid (which is rapidly excreted) and the parent alcohol (which is subsequently metabolised). The pathology of these compounds seems to be related to the released alcohol and its biological effects. The rate of absorption of ingested phthalate esters is influenced by the content of dietary fat. Ingested phthalate esters may to a lesser degree be absorbed as the monoester derivatives or in the case of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, as the diester. Cumulative toxicity of the phthalates has been observed on repeated administration. Both di-n-octyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate were found to have 22-28 times greater toxicity (based on LD50s) following repeated administration to animals. The liver has been shown to be the target organ affected by the phthalates. In general phthalates have induced liver enlargement; this increase in liver weight has been attributed to rapid cell division (hyperplasia) along with the detachment of cells (hypertrophy). The increase in liver weight caused by phthalates has been found to reverse to normal or even below normal levels on prolonged exposure.</p>\n<p>Exposure to phthalates, in general, has been found to be associated with a reduction in circulating cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels which accounted for a reduction in liver steroidogenesis. The phthalates also effect carbohydrate metabolism in the liver producing depleted glycogen electron transport inhibitors following interaction with mitochondria. Testicular atrophy produced in rats during feeding studies depends on the length and structure of the alcohol; in general the lower molecular weight esters produce the more severe effects. The toxicity of phthalic acid isomers decreases in the order o-phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Phthalic acid is not metabolised but is excreted, unchanged, in the urine and faeces. Terephthalic acid appears to potentiate the biological effects of substances such as antibiotics, thiamine and sulfonamides.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p>",

The liver showed occasional damage, consisting of fatty degeneration in the central portion of the lobule and an increased number of round cells in the portal spaces; the proximal tubules of the kidney showed desquamation of the epithelium whilst the convoluted tubules showed granular precipitates or castes in the lumina.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic exposure to certain peroxides produces allergic dermatitis (with redness and scaling of the skin) and asthmatic wheezing.</p> <p>The various phthalates have different uses, chemical structures and toxicity profiles. It is therefore difficult to generalise about the safety of all phthalates as a group. The main health concern associated with some phthalates is that animal studies have shown that high regular doses can affect the reproductive system in developing young, particularly males. While there is no significant risk to the general population, young children may experience higher exposures than the general population if they chew or suck on phthalate-containing toys, or if they ingest phthalates over a long period from other products containing high levels of phthalates.</p>\n<p>In animal tests, phthalates have been shown to \"feminise\" male animals, increasing the likelihood of small or undeveloped testes, undescended testicles, and low sperm counts. A 2005 study also linked higher foetal exposure to phthalates through the mother's blood with increased risk of developmental abnormalities in male infants. Higher phthalate levels are also associated with lower testosterone production and reduced sperm count in men.</p>\n<p>One study suggested that high levels of phthalates may be connected to the current obesity epidemic in children. It was found that obese children show greater exposure to phthalates than non-obese children. It was reported that the obesity risk increases according to the level of the chemical found in the children's bloodstream. in a national cross-section of U.S. men, concentrations of several prevalent phthalate metabolites showed statistically significant correlations with abnormal obesity and insulin resistance. A further study found that people with elevated phthalate levels had roughly twice the risk of developing diabetes compared with those with lower levels. This study also found that phthalates were associated with disrupted insulin production.</p>\n<p>Much of the current research on effects of phthalate exposure has been focused towards children and men's health, however, women may be at higher risk for potential adverse health effects of phthalates due to increased cosmetic use.\u00a0 According to in vivo and observational studies there is an association between phthalate exposure and endocrine disruption leading to development of breast cancer. This finding may be associated with the demethylation of the oestrogen receptor complex in breast cancer cells.</p>\n<p>A Russian study describes exposure by workers to mixed phthalates (and other plasticisers) - pain, numbness and spasms in the upper and lower extremities were related to duration of exposures. Symptoms usually developed after the sixth or seventh year of work. Neurological studies revealed the development of polyneuritis in about 30% of the workers involved in this study. About 30% of the workforce showed depression of the vestibular receptors. Because the study described mixed exposures it is difficult to determine what, if any, unique role was played by the phthalates. Increased incidences of anovulatory reproductive cycles and low oestrogen concentrations were reported among Russian women working with phthalate plasticisers; the abnormal cycles were associated with spontaneous abortion. The specific phthalates implicated, dose levels and other data were not reported. It has been alleged that the phthalates mimic or interfere with sex packaging) and are used as ingredients in paints, inks and adhesives. Their potential for entering the human body is marked. They have been added to a list of chemicals (including alkyl phenolics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins) which are implicated in reducing sperm counts and fertility in males a phenomenon which has apparently arisen since the mid 1960s.</p>\n<p>Phthalates are generally considered to be in a class of endocrine disruptors known as \"xenoestrogens,\" for their ability to mimic the effect of oestrogen on the body.</p>\n<p>Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants</p>\n<p>Human phthalate exposure during pregnancy results in decreased anogenital distance among baby boys.Boys born to mothers with the highest levels of phthalates were 7 times more likely to have a shortened anogenital distance.</p>\n<p>While anogenital distance is routinely used as a measure of foetal exposure to endocrine disruptors in animals, this parameter is rarely assessed in humans, and its significance is unknown</p>\n<p>One study also found that female animals exposed to higher levels of phthalates experienced increased risk of miscarriage, a common symptom of excessive estrogen levels in human women, and stillbirth. Prematurity may also be linked to phthalate exposure.</p>\n<p>Another study found a link between exposure to phthalates and increased rates of childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>In adult human men, phthalates have been linked to greater waist circumference and higher insulin resistance, a common precursor to type 2 (adult onset) diabetes. They have been linked to thyroid irregularities, asthma, and skin allergies in both sexes. Though the exact mechanism is unclear, studies have linked higher rates of respiratory infections and other symptoms in children living in houses with vinyl floors. One possible explanation is inhalation of dust tainted by phthalates, which are used in cosmetics such as nail polishes and hand creams precisely because of their ability to bind to human tissues.</p>\n<p>Animal studies have shown increased risks of certain birth defects (including the genital abnormalities and, in rats, extra ribs) and low birth rates in rats whose mothers were fed higher levels of phthalates.</p>\n<p>These effects on foetal development are of particular concern because young women of childbearing age often have higher than average phthalate levels in the body thanks to their use of cosmetics, many of which contain phthalates.</p>\n<p>The EU has applied limitations to the use of several phthalates in general food contact applications (packaging and closures) and medical device applications. The USA\u00a0 has introduced regulation of phthalate esters as components of children's toys and childcare articles for children under the age of 12 that could be 'placed in the mouth'.</p>\n<p>Endocrine disruptors such as phthalates can be add to the effects of other endocrine disruptors, so even very small amounts can interact with other chemicals to have cumulative, adverse \"cocktail effects\"</p>\n<p>Large amounts of specific phthalates fed to rodents have been shown to damage their liver and testes, and initial rodent studies also indicated hepatocarcinogenicity. Later studies on primates showed that the mechanism is specific to rodents - humans are resistant to the effect</p>\n<p>Studies conducted on mice exposed to phthalates in utero did not result in metabolic disorder in adults. However, \"At least one phthalate, monoethyhexyl phthalate (MEHP) has been found to interact with all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in lipid and carbohdrate metabolism.</p>\n<p>Prenatal exposure to phthalates may affect children's mental, motor and behavioral development during the preschool year.</p>\n<p>A 2009 study found that prenatal phthalate exposure was related to low birth weight in infants. Low birth weight is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age and increases the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in adulthood. Another study found that women who deliver prematurely have, on average, up to three times the phthalate level in their urine compared to women who carry to term.</p>\n<p>Several findings point to a statistically significant correlation between urine phthalate concentrations in children and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

In general, they do not persist due to rapid\r\nbiodegradation, photodegradation, and anaerobic degradation. Outdoor air\r\nconcentrations are higher in urban and suburban areas than in rural and remote\r\nareas. They also pose no acute toxicity. In general, children's exposure to\r\nphthalates is greater than that of adults</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate;</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Under aerobic and anaerobic\r\nconditions, studies reveal that many phthalate esters are degraded by a wide\r\nrange of bacteria and actinomycetes. Standardized aerobic biodegradation tests\r\nwith sewage sludge inocula show that within 28 days approximately 50% ultimate\r\ndegradation occurs. Biodegradation is, therefore, expected to be the dominant\r\npathway in surface soils and sediments. In the atmosphere, photodegradation via\r\nfree radical attack is the anticipated dominant pathway. The half-life of many\r\nphthalate esters is ca. 1 day in the air, from &lt; 1 day to 2 weeks in surface\r\nand marine waters, and from &lt; 1 week to several months in soils.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phthalates are high molecular\r\nweight chemicals, and are not expected to partition significantly to air.\r\nHowever for the minor amount that may partition to air, modelled predictions\r\nindicate that they would be rapidly oxidised: with a\u00a0 predicted atmospheric\r\noxidation half-life of around 0.52 days . They are expected to react\r\nappreciably with other photo oxidative species in the atmosphere, such as O3.\r\nTherefore, it is expected that reactions with hydroxyl radicals will be the\r\nmost important fate process in the atmosphere for phthalates</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation of phthalate\r\nesters in the aquatic and terrestrial food chain is limited by\r\nbiotransformation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most phthalates have experimental\r\nbioaccumulation factor (BCFs) and bioconcentration factor (BAFs) below 5000\r\nL/kg, as they are readily metabolised by fish</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A study of 18 commercial\r\nphthalate esters with alkyl chains ranging from one to 13 carbons found an\r\neight order of magnitude increase in octanol-water coefficients (Kow) and a\r\nfour order of magnitude decrease in vapor pressure with increasing length. This\r\nincrease in Kow and decrease in vapor pressure results in increased\r\npartitioning of the phthalate esters to suspended solids, soils, sediments, and\r\naerosols</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The phthalate esters are\r\ndistributed throughout the environment ubiquitously. They are found complexed\r\nwith fulvic acid components of the humic substances in soil and marine and\r\nestuarine waters. Fulvic acid appears to act as a solubiliser for the otherwise\r\ninsoluble ester and serves to mediate its transport and mobilisation in water\r\nor immobilisation in soil. Phthalate esters have been found in open ocean\r\nenvironments, in deep sea jelly fish, Atlantic herring and in mackerel.\r\nPhthalic ester plasticisers are clearly recognised as general contaminants of\r\nalmost every soil and water ecosystem. In general they have low acute toxicity\r\nbut the weight of evidence supporting their carcinogenicity is substantial.\r\nOther subtle chronic effects have also been reported. As little as 4 ug/ml in\r\nculture medium is lethal to chick embryo heart cells. This concentration is\r\nsimilar to that reached in human blood stored in vinyl plastic bags for as\r\nlittle as one day.\u00a0 As phthalates are present in drinking water and food,\r\nconcerns have been raised about their long term effects on humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Some phthalates (notably\r\ndi-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate) may be detrimental to the\r\nreproduction of the water flea (Daphnia magna), zebra fish and guppies</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While phthalates may have very\r\nlow true water solubilities, they possess the ability to form suspensions which\r\nmay cause adverse effects through physical contact with <i>Daphnia</i> at very\r\nlow concentrations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available toxicity and water\r\nsolubility information suggest that the high molecular weight phthalates, form\r\nthese suspensions and are able to elicit chronic toxic effects at\r\nconcentrations of approximately 0.05 mg/L .

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>During World War II dimethyl phthalate was used as an insect repellant.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of dimethyl phthalate may cause central nervous system depression.</p> <p>Phthalates (aromatic dicarboxylic acid esters), in general, exhibit low toxicity, partly because of poor absorption but mainly as a result of rapid metabolism in which the esters are saponified to phthalic acid (which is rapidly excreted) and the parent alcohol (which is subsequently metabolised). The pathology of these compounds seems to be related to the released alcohol and its biological effects. The rate of absorption of ingested phthalate esters is influenced by the content of dietary fat. Ingested phthalate esters may to a lesser degree be absorbed as the monoester derivatives or in the case of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, as the diester. Cumulative toxicity of the phthalates has been observed on repeated administration. Both di-n-octyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate were found to have 22-28 times greater toxicity (based on LD50s) following repeated administration to animals. The liver has been shown to be the target organ affected by the phthalates. In general phthalates have induced liver enlargement; this increase in liver weight has been attributed to rapid cell division (hyperplasia) along with the detachment of cells (hypertrophy). The increase in liver weight caused by phthalates has been found to reverse to normal or even below normal levels on prolonged exposure.</p>\n<p>Exposure to phthalates, in general, has been found to be associated with a reduction in circulating cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels which accounted for a reduction in liver steroidogenesis. The phthalates also effect carbohydrate metabolism in the liver producing depleted glycogen electron transport inhibitors following interaction with mitochondria. Testicular atrophy produced in rats during feeding studies depends on the length and structure of the alcohol; in general the lower molecular weight esters produce the more severe effects. The toxicity of phthalic acid isomers decreases in the order o-phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Phthalic acid is not metabolised but is excreted, unchanged, in the urine and faeces. Terephthalic acid appears to potentiate the biological effects of substances such as antibiotics, thiamine and sulfonamides.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for human fertility, on the basis that similar materials provide some evidence of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Dimethyl phthalate has the ability to accumulate in body tissues because of its high lipid solubility and low water solubility, therefore chronic exposure tends to be more important than acute exposure</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>The various phthalates have different uses, chemical structures and toxicity profiles. It is therefore difficult to generalise about the safety of all phthalates as a group. The main health concern associated with some phthalates is that animal studies have shown that high regular doses can affect the reproductive system in developing young, particularly males. While there is no significant risk to the general population, young children may experience higher exposures than the general population if they chew or suck on phthalate-containing toys, or if they ingest phthalates over a long period from other products containing high levels of phthalates.</p>\n<p>In animal tests, phthalates have been shown to \"feminise\" male animals, increasing the likelihood of small or undeveloped testes, undescended testicles, and low sperm counts. A 2005 study also linked higher foetal exposure to phthalates through the mother's blood with increased risk of developmental abnormalities in male infants. Higher phthalate levels are also associated with lower testosterone production and reduced sperm count in men.</p>\n<p>One study suggested that high levels of phthalates may be connected to the current obesity epidemic in children. It was found that obese children show greater exposure to phthalates than non-obese children. It was reported that the obesity risk increases according to the level of the chemical found in the children's bloodstream. in a national cross-section of U.S. men, concentrations of several prevalent phthalate metabolites showed statistically significant correlations with abnormal obesity and insulin resistance. A further study found that people with elevated phthalate levels had roughly twice the risk of developing diabetes compared with those with lower levels. This study also found that phthalates were associated with disrupted insulin production.</p>\n<p>Much of the current research on effects of phthalate exposure has been focused towards children and men's health, however, women may be at higher risk for potential adverse health effects of phthalates due to increased cosmetic use.\u00a0 According to in vivo and observational studies there is an association between phthalate exposure and endocrine disruption leading to development of breast cancer. This finding may be associated with the demethylation of the oestrogen receptor complex in breast cancer cells.</p>\n<p>A Russian study describes exposure by workers to mixed phthalates (and other plasticisers) - pain, numbness and spasms in the upper and lower extremities were related to duration of exposures. Symptoms usually developed after the sixth or seventh year of work. Neurological studies revealed the development of polyneuritis in about 30% of the workers involved in this study. About 30% of the workforce showed depression of the vestibular receptors. Because the study described mixed exposures it is difficult to determine what, if any, unique role was played by the phthalates. Increased incidences of anovulatory reproductive cycles and low oestrogen concentrations were reported among Russian women working with phthalate plasticisers; the abnormal cycles were associated with spontaneous abortion. The specific phthalates implicated, dose levels and other data were not reported. It has been alleged that the phthalates mimic or interfere with sex packaging) and are used as ingredients in paints, inks and adhesives. Their potential for entering the human body is marked. They have been added to a list of chemicals (including alkyl phenolics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins) which are implicated in reducing sperm counts and fertility in males a phenomenon which has apparently arisen since the mid 1960s.</p>\n<p>Phthalates are generally considered to be in a class of endocrine disruptors known as \"xenoestrogens,\" for their ability to mimic the effect of oestrogen on the body.</p>\n<p>Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants</p>\n<p>Human phthalate exposure during pregnancy results in decreased anogenital distance among baby boys.Boys born to mothers with the highest levels of phthalates were 7 times more likely to have a shortened anogenital distance.</p>\n<p>While anogenital distance is routinely used as a measure of foetal exposure to endocrine disruptors in animals, this parameter is rarely assessed in humans, and its significance is unknown</p>\n<p>One study also found that female animals exposed to higher levels of phthalates experienced increased risk of miscarriage, a common symptom of excessive estrogen levels in human women, and stillbirth. Prematurity may also be linked to phthalate exposure.</p>\n<p>Another study found a link between exposure to phthalates and increased rates of childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>In adult human men, phthalates have been linked to greater waist circumference and higher insulin resistance, a common precursor to type 2 (adult onset) diabetes. They have been linked to thyroid irregularities, asthma, and skin allergies in both sexes. Though the exact mechanism is unclear, studies have linked higher rates of respiratory infections and other symptoms in children living in houses with vinyl floors. One possible explanation is inhalation of dust tainted by phthalates, which are used in cosmetics such as nail polishes and hand creams precisely because of their ability to bind to human tissues.</p>\n<p>Animal studies have shown increased risks of certain birth defects (including the genital abnormalities and, in rats, extra ribs) and low birth rates in rats whose mothers were fed higher levels of phthalates.</p>\n<p>These effects on foetal development are of particular concern because young women of childbearing age often have higher than average phthalate levels in the body thanks to their use of cosmetics, many of which contain phthalates.</p>\n<p>The EU has applied limitations to the use of several phthalates in general food contact applications (packaging and closures) and medical device applications. The USA\u00a0 has introduced regulation of phthalate esters as components of children's toys and childcare articles for children under the age of 12 that could be 'placed in the mouth'.</p>\n<p>Endocrine disruptors such as phthalates can be add to the effects of other endocrine disruptors, so even very small amounts can interact with other chemicals to have cumulative, adverse \"cocktail effects\"</p>\n<p>Large amounts of specific phthalates fed to rodents have been shown to damage their liver and testes, and initial rodent studies also indicated hepatocarcinogenicity. Later studies on primates showed that the mechanism is specific to rodents - humans are resistant to the effect</p>\n<p>Studies conducted on mice exposed to phthalates in utero did not result in metabolic disorder in adults. However, \"At least one phthalate, monoethyhexyl phthalate (MEHP) has been found to interact with all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in lipid and carbohdrate metabolism.</p>\n<p>Prenatal exposure to phthalates may affect children's mental, motor and behavioral development during the preschool year.</p>\n<p>A 2009 study found that prenatal phthalate exposure was related to low birth weight in infants. Low birth weight is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age and increases the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in adulthood. Another study found that women who deliver prematurely have, on average, up to three times the phthalate level in their urine compared to women who carry to term.</p>\n<p>Several findings point to a statistically significant correlation between urine phthalate concentrations in children and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Lethal doses in animals progress to a narcosis lasting for several days; death was delayed for 1-4 days. Human subjects have ingested 5 gm daily for 5 days without apparent ill-effect or urine abnormalities. Eliminated in the urine, partly (20-25%) in conjugated forms</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>",

Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of methyl ethyl ketone from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is also expected given the measured Henry's Law constant of 4.7x10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The volatilisation half-life of methyl ethyl ketone from silt and sandy loams was measured as 4.9 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as indicated by numerous screening tests.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: Based on Koc values, methyl ethyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 and 197, hours respectively. Biodegradation of this compound is expected based upon numerous screening tests. An estimated BCF value of 1 based on an experimental log Kow of 0.29, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, methyl ethyl ketone, which has an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C, will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase methyl ethyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is also expected to undergo photodecomposition in the atmosphere by natural sunlight. Photochemical degradation of methyl ethyl ketone by natural sunlight is expected to occur at approximately 1/5 the rate of degradation by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 1690-5640 mg/l; guppy (Lebistes reticulatus) 5700 mg/l; goldfish (Carassius auratus) &gt;5000 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 3200 mg/l; bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 4467 mg/l; mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) 5600 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h):&lt;520-1382 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (24 h): 8890 mg/l</p> <p>Brine shrimp (Artemia salina) LC50 (24 h): 1950 mg/l</p> <p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive substance in the presence of other substances, elements, radiation, materials and can be degraded by micro-organisms or higher organisms.</p> <p>Air: Hydrogen peroxide may be removed from the atmosphere by photolysis giving rise to hydroxyl radicals, by reaction with hydroxyl radicals, or by heterogenous loss processes such as rain-out. Significantly higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations are found in polluted atmospheres as compared with clean air. These concentrations are believed to arise from photochemically-initiated oxidation of reactive hydrocarbons. Under severe smog conditions, daytime levels of hydrogen peroxide as high as 0.18 ppm have been reported, but atmospheric night-time levels of 2-5 ppb did not correlate to smog intensity.</p> <p>Soil: No information was found in the secondary sources searched regarding the transformation or persistence of hydrogen peroxide in soil, however, solutions of hydrogen peroxide gradually deteriorate.\u00a0</p> <p>Water: Hydrogen peroxide is a naturally occurring substance. Surface water concentrations of hydrogen peroxide have been found to vary between 51-231 mg/L, increasing both with exposure to sunlight and the presence of dissolved organic matter.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide degrades by various mechanisms, including chemical reduction and enzymatic (catalase and peroxidase) decomposition by algae, zooplankton, and bacteria. Microorganisms, especially bacteria, account for the majority of degradation, significantly more than all other chemical and biological mechanisms. The rate at which hydrogen peroxide decomposes in natural water can vary from a few minutes to more than a week, depending on numerous chemical, biological, and physical factors.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide is rapidly degraded in a biological waste water treatment plant. Hydrogen peroxide adsorbs poorly to sediment particles and is rapidly degraded, thus accumulation in the sediment is also not expected\u00a0</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide (log Kow &lt; -1) is an inorganic substance and therefore shows little potential to bioaccumulate.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): catfish 37.4 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): mackerel 89 mg/l; chameleon gobi 155 mg/l</p> <p>Zebra mussel LC50 (28 h) 30 mg/l; (228 h): 12 mg/l\u00a0</p> <p>Ecotoxicity data show that microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, algae) and zooplankton present in aquatic ecosystems are generally less tolerant of hydrogen peroxide exposure than are fish or other vertebrates. Effects of short-term exposures on sensitive bacteria and invertebrates (e.g., Daphnia pulex<b><i>)\u00a0</i></b>have been observed at concentrations in the low mg/L (ppm) range, while effects on sensitive algae have been reported at levels less than 1.0 mg/L. Algae are the most sensitive species for hydrogen peroxide. The algal EC50 of hydrogen peroxide was 1.6-5 mg/l, while the NOEC was 0.1 mg/l. In a 21-d continuous exposure study on Daphnia\u00a0<i>magna</i>, the chronic no observable effect concentration (NOEC) for reproduction was 0.63 mg/L and the NOEC for mortality was 1.25 mg/L.</p> <p>In chronic toxicity studies with invertebrates (zebra mussels) and hydrogen peroxide shows an NOEC of 2 mg/l. The PNEC of hydrogen peroxide is equal to 10 ug/l.</p> <p>Risk mitigation is needed to ensure that use of hydrogen peroxide will not adversely impact aquatic life. An acute water quality criterion or \"benchmark\" has been determined. For hydrogen peroxide, the acute benchmark is 0.7 mg/L. This value was calculated using the extensive toxicity database for hydrogen peroxide and procedures in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance for deriving numerical national water quality criteria. The use of hydrogen peroxide in intensive aquaculture in finfish (at up to 100 mg/L for 60 minutes) and finfish eggs (at up to 1,000 mg/L for 15 minutes) is not expected to have a significant impact on the environment.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Systemic poisoning due to hydrogen peroxide inhalation may cause tremors and numbness of the extremities, convulsions, pulmonary oedema, coma and shock. Hydrogen peroxide has poor warning properties. High concentrations of the vapour or mist are likely to cause extreme irritation of the nose and chest, cough, discomfort, shortness of breath, \u00a0and inflammation of the nose and throat.</p> <p><br /></p>",

Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Corneal ulcerations due to hydrogen peroxide exposure may not appear for up to a week after exposure; concentrations above 10% are corrosive to the eye.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce severe chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to produce harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives using animal models). Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Skin contact will result in rapid drying, bleaching, leading to chemical burns on prolonged contact</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide as a topical gel is used to cleanse minor wounds or minor gum inflammation. In appropriate solution, hydrogen peroxide is used in topical and dental gels \u00a0Skin contact may cause bleaching, blistering and reddening. \u00a0Short term contact results in temporary whitening and a tingling sensation due to diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into the skin. The characteristic whitening of the skin occurs after topical application of hydrogen peroxide (1-30%), which is believed the result of avascularity of the skin produced by oxygen bubbles acting microembolically in the capillaries. Concentrations above 50% are corrosive to skin.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce severe chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide may cause blistering and bleeding from the throat and stomach. Ingested hydrogen peroxide may evolve large quantities of oxygen which could hyper-distend the gastro-intestinal tract and may cause internal bleeding Ingestion of large amounts of hydrogen peroxide causes chest and stomach pain, loss of consciousness, and motor disorders in humans and has caused mortality in experimental animals.</p> <p>Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide containing/ generating materials may cause nausea, vomiting and, possibly, internal bleeding. Rapid evolution of oxygen in the acid environment of the stomach (up to 10 times the volume of the ingested solution) may result in severe organ damage. Large doses are presumed to produce gastritis and oesophagitis. Cases of rupture of the colon, proctitis and ulcerative colitis have been reported following hydrogen peroxide enemas. Powders and tablets that generate hydrogen peroxide, such as Oxone (KHSO5), have caused oral and oesophageal burns when ingested.</p> <p>Large amounts of hydrogen peroxide taken orally by humans has caused apnea, dizziness, headache, tremors weakness or numbness in the extremities, convulsions, loss of consciousness and shock.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide concentrate is caustic and should not be tasted undiluted. Rats receiving 2.5% hydrogen peroxide (equivalent to approximately 3.5 g/kg/day ) in their drinking water died within 43 days. Cases of rupture of the colon, inflammation of the anus or rectum, and ulcerative colitis have been reported following hydrogen peroxide enemas</p> <p>In five persons who accidentally drank about 50 mL of a 33% hydrogen peroxide solution, symptoms included stomach and chest pain, retention of breath, foaming at the mouth, and loss of consciousness. Later, motor and sensory disorders, fever, microhaemorrhages and moderate leucocytosis were noted. All recovered completely within 2-3 weeks .</p> <p><br /></p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide as a human food additive is generally regarded as safe when used in certain limitations. In experimental animals, oral administration of hydrogen peroxide causes dental, liver, kidney, stomach, and intestinal damage. Inhalation exposure to hydrogen peroxide caused skin irritation and sneezing in dogs, and high mortality in mice.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide added to food is affirmed to be generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA when used to treat certain foods in specified limitations [FDA 21 CFR 184.1366 (4/1/93)]. Hydrogen peroxide may be used as a component of articles for use in packaging, handling, transporting, or holding food in accordance with prescribed conditions [FDA 21 CFR 175.105 (4/1/93)].</p> <p>Dose-related growth retardation, induction of dental caries, and pathological changes in the periodontium were observed in young male rats receiving 1.5% hydrogen peroxide as their drinking fluid (equivalent to approximately 2.1 g/kg/day)2\u00a0for 8 weeks .</p> <p>Effects observed in mice treated for 35 weeks with 0.15% hydrogen peroxide as their drinking fluid (equivalent to approximately 0.29 g/kg/day)3\u00a0included degeneration of hepatic and renal tubular epithelial tissues, necrosis, inflammation, irregularities of tissue structure of the stomach wall, and hypertrophy of the small intestine wall. Concentrations in excess of 1% (equivalent to approximately 1.9 g/kg/day)4\u00a0resulted in pronounced weight loss and death within two weeks. In a sequential study of mice treated with 0.4% hydrogen peroxide in drinking water (equivalent to approximately 0.76 g/kg/day)5\u00a0, gastric erosion was observed at 30 days and was present consistently throughout the 108 week study period.</p> <p>Dogs exposed 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 months at an average vapour concentration of 7 ppm (9.73 mg/3 ) of 90% hydrogen peroxide, developed skin irritation, sneezing, lacrimation, and bleaching of the hair. Autopsy disclosed pulmonary irritation and greatly thickened skin, but no hair follicle destruction. No significant changes in blood or urinary parameters were observed .</p> <p>Following eight 6-hour exposures to hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 79 mg/m3\u00a0(56.88 ppm), 7/9 mice died. Following exposure to hydrogen peroxide at 93 mg/m3 , 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 30 exposures, 1/10 rats died</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",
