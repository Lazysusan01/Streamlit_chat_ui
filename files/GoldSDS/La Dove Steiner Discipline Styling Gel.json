Within each group, the\r\nmonoterpenoids may be simple unsaturated hydrocarbons or may have functional\r\ngroups and be alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. Common aliphatic examples\r\ninclude myrcene, citral, geraniol, lavandulol, and linalool. The important\r\nrepresentatives of monocyclic monoterpenoids are alpha-terpineol, limonene,\r\nthymol, menthol, carvone, eucalyptol, and perillaldehyde. The bicyclic\r\nmonoterpenes may be divided into three classes according to the size of the\r\nsecond ring. The first being a six-membered ring in each class while the second\r\ncan be either a three, four, or five-membered ring.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time.

It is a naturally occurring component together with linalyl esters in a variety of fruits, fruit peels, fruit juices, vegetables and spices as for example laurel, coriander seeds and clary sage. The annual worldwide use of linalool and linalyl acetate in fragrances exceeds 1000 metric tons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0For consideration of potential sensitization the exposure is calculated as a percent concentration used on the skin. Exposure to linalool used in fine fragrance products is reported as 4.3% based on the use of 20% of the fragrance mixture in the fine fragrance consumer product.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Experimental studies in laboratory animals combined with advanced chemical analyses have shown that linalool is easily oxidized, and that the content of linalool decreased to about 80% after oxidation for 10 weeks at standardized conditions. One of the major oxidation products was identified as 7-hydroperoxy-3,7-dimethyl-octal-1,5-diene-3-ol. In guinea pig sensitisation studies a sample of oxidized linalool was a significant allergen sensitizing 8 of 15 test animals, whereas controls were negative. Linalyl hydroperoxide is a very strong sensitiser at the 1% level. Further studies have documented the sensitising capacity of linalool and derivatives \u00a0found commercially available grade of linalool (97% purity) to be a weak sensitiser. When impurities were identified and removed the sensitising capacity was reduced but not eliminated. During storage, linalool undergoes autoxidation, building up products including hydroperoxides such as 7-hydroperoxy-3,7-dimethyl-octal-1,5-diene-3-ol , which has been identified as the apparent cause allergic reactions on exposed skin. Animal testing data found that with guinea pigs, ten week old samples of linalool sensitized the animals skin, but highly purified linalool produces no reaction. Auto-oxidation was therefore identified by the authors as necessary for the sensitising process.</p> <p>Peroxidisable terpenes and terpenoids should only be used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level, for instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

Activated charcoal should be prescribed in a case of acute overdose. Otherwise the treatment should target specific signs and symptoms such as hypertension, agitation, seizures, and hyperthermia. Rapid supportive treatment may reduce mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>Supportive therapy</strong></p>\n<p>Acute intoxication usually presents with increased sensitivity to sensorial stimuli and paranoia. As such, decreasing the patient's level of stimulation (keep voice low, dim lights, minimise touch) and working with the patient's paranoid state (reduce eye contact, respect personal space, do not approach from behind) is important.</p>\n<p>As in all cases of suspected poisoning, follow the ABCDEs of emergency medicine (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure), then the ABCDEs of toxicology (antidotes, basics, change absorption, change distribution, change elimination).</p>\n<p>Decontamination with gastric lavage may be appropriate in cases of recent ingestion.</p>\n<p>Monitor vital signs and hydrate with intravenous fluids.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal related insomnia may be treated with trazodone (75-200 mg), hydroxyzine (25-50 mg), or diphenhydramine (50-100 mg) at bedtime.</p>\n<p>Benzodiazepines should be avoided unless the patient is also in detox from alcohol/benzodiazepines/opiates.</p>\n<p>Neuroleptics may be used for the symptomatic treatment of psychosis.</p>\n<p>Physical restraints may be required in certain cases.</p>\n<p>Common withdrawal symptoms may include dysphoria, anxiety, and irritability, decreased energy (manifested as reported fatigue, psychomotor retardation and hypersomnia), hyperphagia, decreased concentration, and paranoia. The withdrawal symptoms are uncomfortable but not life threatening; consequently, no current recommendations for a stimulant-detoxification regimen are available.</p>\n<p>Stimulant withdrawal dysphoria is common and does not in itself represent an indication for an antidepressant. However, a thorough assessment (including consideration of an antidepressant) is recommended for persistent (longer than a week) depressive symptoms at a level of moderate or severe or associated with suicidal ideation/attempts.</p>\n<p>Medscape</p> <p>Treat symptomatically.</p>|Poisoning should be treated by inducing emesis or by gastric lavage; anticonvulsants may be needed [Martindale]",

The calculated photodegradation half-lives for three benzaldehyde derivatives in this chemical category are in the narrow range from 4.7 hours for\u00a0<i>m-</i>methoxy-<i>p-</i>hydroxybenzaldehyde to 7.2 hours for the less substituted derivative benzaldehyde. The relative half-lives reflect the increased reactivity of a phenolic OH group. The half-lives for the aldehydes are shorter than those for the corresponding benzyl and benzoate esters in this category (12.7 for methyl benzoate to 64.5 hours for methyl\u00a0<i>p</i>-methylbenzoate) Generally, the carboxylate function of the ester is more stable to reaction with hydroxyl radicals than The calculated half lives for hydroxyl radical reactions range from 4.7 to 64.5 hours. The calculated photodegradation half-lives for three benzaldehyde derivatives in this chemical category are in the narrow range from 4.7 hours for\u00a0<i>m-</i>methoxy-<i>p</i>hydroxybenzaldehyde to 7.2 hours for the less substituted derivative benzaldehyde . The relative half-lives reflect the increased reactivity of a phenolic OH group. The half-lives for the aldehydes are shorter than those for the corresponding benzyl and benzoate esters in this category (12.7 for methyl benzoate to 64.5 hours for methyl\u00a0<i>p</i>-methylbenzoate). Generally, the carboxylate function of the ester is more stable to reaction with hydroxyl radicals than is the aldehyde function. The presence of an aromatic phenol function capable of undergoing ready hydrogen abstraction of the phenolic hydroxyl group decreases predicted photodegradation half-lives. Therefore, the methyl, pentyl and benzyl esters of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid have calculated half-lives of 11.6, 7.6, and 7.4 hours, respectively</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Benzaldehydes in this group cannot hydrolyse. However, they are likely to be slowly oxidized to their corresponding acids. The calculated hydrolysis half-lives for esters range from 20 days at pH 8 and 198 days at pH 7 for benzyl acetate to 1.1 years at pH 8 and 10.8 years at pH 7 for methyl\u00a0<i>p</i>-methylbenzoate. Benzyl acetate, like several other benzyl esters, was shown to be 50% hydrolysed in 2 hours at pH 7.5 in the presence of pancreatin in an\u00a0<i>in vitro\u00a0</i>simulation experiment . These esters are all expected to be readily hydrolysed\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>All are readily and ultimately biodegradable using a standard OECD 301B test or 301F protocol. The parent acid benzoic acid, its sodium salt, and 2-hydroxybenzoic acid were all readily biodegradable in a COD (chemical oxygen demand) test. Since hydrolysis of the esters and ready oxidation of the aldehydes yields corresponding acid derivatives, the data on benzoic acid, its sodium salt, and 2-hydroxybenzoic acid validate the observations that the aldehydes and esters in this chemical category are readily biodegradable.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Experimental data indicate a low to moderate toxicity for the benzyl derivatives. Benzyl esters and 2-hydroxybenzoate esters (salicylates) exhibit higher acute toxicity to fish than do benzoate esters or benzaldehyde derivatives. Measured values for benzyl and salicylate esters are in the 1-5 mg/l range with salicylates being slightly more toxic. Benzoate ester and benzaldehyde derivatives exhibit 96-hour LC50 values above 10 mg/L</p> <p>Benzaldehyde derivatives exhibit lower acute toxicity compared to the parent substance.</p> <p>Fish LC50 (14-d): guppy 0.17 mg/l (benzaldehyde)</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): guppy 88-116 mg/l (m-methoxy-p-hydroxybenzaldehyde)</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): 13-23.5 mg/l (benzaldehyde, p-methoxybenzaldehyde, m-methoxy-p-hydroxybenzaldehyde; estimated values).</p> <p>Acute toxicity for aquatic invertebrates parallels that for fish in the benzyl chemical category. Benzoate esters exhibit moderate experimental and calculated acute toxicity to invertebrates.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "Use": "<p>In perfumery/ flavouring.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Terpenes are a large and varied class of hydrocarbons produced primarily by a wide variety of plants, particularly conifers, though also by some insects such as swallowtail butterflies, which emit terpenes They are the major components of resins, and of turpentine produced from resin. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as terpinoids. Some authors will use the term terpene to include all terpenoids. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential of many types of plants and flowers. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives Vitamin A is an example of a terpene.</p> <p>Terpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of isoprene which has the molecular formula C5H8. The basic molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of that, (C5H8)n where n is the number of linked isoprene units. This is called the isoprene rule or the C5 rule. The isoprene units may be linked together \"head to tail\" to form linear chains or they may be arranged to form rings. One can consider the isoprene unit as one of nature's common building blocks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As chains of isoprene units are built up, the resulting terpenes are classified sequentially by size as hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, sesterterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hemiterpenes consist of a single isoprene unit. Isoprene itself is considered the only hemiterpene, but oxygen-containing derivatives such as prenol and isovaleric acid are hemiterpenoids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Monoterpenes consist of two isoprene units and have the molecular formula C10H16. Examples of monoterpenes are: geraniol, limonene, terpineol.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sesquiterpenes consist of three isoprene units and have the molecular formula C15H24. Examples of sesquiterpenes are:farnesol . The sesqui- prefix means one and a half.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Diterpenes are composed for four isoprene units and have the molecular formula C20H32. They derive from geranyl pyrophosphate. Examples of diterpenes are cafestol, kahweol, cembren and taxadiene (precursor of Taxol). Diterpenes also form the basis for biologically important compounds such as retinol, retinal and phytol.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sesterterpenes, terpenes having 25 carbons and five isoprene units, are rare relative to the other sizes. The sester- prefix means half to three, i.e. two and a half.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Triterpenes consist of six isoprene units and have the molecular formula C30H48. The linear triterpene squalene the major constituent of shark liver oil, is derived from the reductive coupling of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Squalene is then processed biosynthetically to generate either lanosterol or cycloartenol the structural precursors to all the steroids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Tetraterpenes contain eight isoprene units and have the molecular formula C40H56. Biologically important tetraterpenes include the acyclic lycopene, the monocyclic gamma-carotene, and the bicyclic alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Polyterpenes consist of long chains of many isoprene units.Rubber consists of polyisoprene in which double bonds are cis-. Some plants produce a polyisoprene with trans double bonds, known as gutta-percha</p>|Flavouring, fragrance and perfume materials.

Reactions with nitrogen oxides produce aerosol formation as well as lower molecular weight products such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone and peroxyacetyl nitrate.</p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>\u00a0When released to the ground limonene is expected to have low to very low mobility in soil based on its physicochemical properties. The soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) calculated on the basis of solubility (13.8 mg/l, 25 C) and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (4.23) ranges from 1030 and 4780. The Henry's law constant indicates that limonene will rapidly volatilise from both dry and moist soil; however its absorption to soil may slow the process.</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate</b>: In the aquatic environment, limonene is expected to evaporate to a significant extent owing \u00a0to its high volatility. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of limonene from a model river ( 1 m deep, flow 1 m/s and wind speed 3 m/s) is 3.4 h. Some limonene is expected to absorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation and bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Limonene does not have functional groups for hydrolysis and its cyclohexene ring and ethylene group are known to resist hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of limonene is not expected in terrestrial or in aquatic environments. The hydrolytic half-life of d-limonene is estimated to be &gt;1000 days. Biotic degradation of limonene has been shown with some species of microorganisms such as\u00a0<i>Penicillium digitatum, Corynespora cassiicola, Diplodia gossyppina</i>\u00a0and a soil strain of<i>\u00a0Pseudomonans sp (SL strain).\u00a0</i>Limonene is readily biodegradable (41-98% degradation by biological oxygen demand in 14 d) under aerobic conditions in a standard test (OECD 301 C \"Modified MITI Test (1)\", OECD, 1981a; MITI, 1992). Also in a test simulating aerobic sewage treatment (OECD 303 A \"Simulation Test - Aerobic Sewage Treatment: Coupled Units Test\"; OECD, 1981b), limonene disappeared almost completely (&gt;93.8%) during 14 days of incubation.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation has been assessed under anaerobic conditions; there was no indication of any metabolisms, possibly because of the toxicity to micro-organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>The bioconcentration factor, calculated on the basis of water solubility and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Kow) is 246-262, suggesting that limonene may bioaccumulate in fish and other aquatic species.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b>\u00a0Technical limonene is practically nontoxic to birds on a subacute dietary basis, and is slightly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates on an acute basis.\u00a0</p> <p>for d-limonene:</p> <p>LD50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 16 weeks old) oral &gt;2000 mg/kg</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 10 day old) dietary &gt;5620 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Anas platyrhynchos (Mallard duck, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 80 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 71.4-88.7 ppm); static /92% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 568 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 437-852 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>EC50 Daphnia magna (Water flea, &lt;24 hr old; intoxication, immobilization) 17 ppm/48 hr (95% confidence limit: 11-33 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 966 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 740-1652 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 38.5 mg/L/96 hr; flow through /from table/ LC50</p> <p>Leuciscus idus (Golden orfe) 32 mg/L/48 hr /Conditions of bioassay not specified in source examined</p> <p>The acute toxicity of \u00a0d-limonene ranges from slight to high for aquatic organisms. The lowest acute toxicity values (EC50 or LC50) identified were approximately 0.4 mg/litre for Daphnia (US EPA, 1990b) and 0.7 mg/litre for fish (US EPA, 1990a,b). The no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for</p> <p>green algae is approximately 4 mg/litre (US EPA, 1990a). The acute toxicity (EC50 or LC50) of dipentene to Daphnia and fish is about 50-70 times lower than that for d-limonene (US EPA, 1990b). No studies were identified on the chronic toxicity of limonene to aquatic organisms.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

In human patch testing, weak or moderate reactions (erythema, swelling) have been observed. Positive eczematous responses to purified limonene were observed in 5 of 16 previously sensitised to oil of turpentine. In one study, a 39-year old male immersed one hand in a jar of solvent, ensuring that inhalation exposure was minimal. After only few minutes of exposure, the subject experienced painful itching and burning. Itching decreased after the exposure but burning continued for 10 minutes. Swelling disappeared after 100 minutes. Six hours post-exposure, a purpuric eruption was observed; this persisted for several weeks.

They may result when d-limonene is unstabilised against oxidation, or upon prolonged standing at room temperature and/ or upon exposure to light, or when stabiliser levels diminish. The two major hydroperoxides in auto-oxidised d-limonene, \u00a0are cis- and trans- limonene-2-hydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-p-mentha-6,8-diene). In photo-oxidised d-limonene, they represent a minor fraction. Hydroperoxides may bind to proteins of the skin to make antigens either via a radical mechanism or after reactions to give epoxides. The cross-reactivity between the epoxide limonene-1,2-oxide, a potent contact allergen, and the hydroperoxides is NOT significant, indicating different mechanisms of sensitisation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0d-Limonene was considered to be weakly carcinogenic for the mouse fore-stomach epithelium, but not tumour producing. In 13-week and 2-year gavage-studies, male rats showed a range of compound-related kidney lesions including exacerbation of age-related nephropathy, mineralisation in the renal medulla, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium overlying the renal papilla and proliferation of the renal tubular epithelium. Neoplasms were believed to be caused by progression to tubular cell hyperplasia to tubular cell adenomas and, with increasing size, to adenocarcinomas or carcinomas. The similarity of the nephrotoxicity caused by trichloroethylene and N-(4'-fluoro-4-biphenyl)acetamide, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate in rats and the species specific nature of the response suggests that degeneration and necrosis of convoluted tubules may be associated with the accumulation of alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G). Since a2u-G is a species and gender-specific protein that is causal for both the cytotoxic and carcinogenic response in male rats, extrapolation of d-limonene carcinogenicity data from rat studies to other species (including humans) is probably not warranted. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G; they do however produce other related low molecular weight proteins capable of binding chemicals that cause a2u-G nephropathy in rats but this does not necessarily connote human risk. The Risk Assessment Forum of the USA EPA concluded;</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0Male renal rat tumours arising as a result of a process involving a2u-G accumulation do not contribute to the qualitative weight-of-evidence that the chemical poses a human carcinogenic hazard. Such tumours are included in dose-response extrapolations for the estimation of human carcinogenic risk.\u00a0</li> <li>If the chemical induces a2u-G accumulation in male rats, the associated nephropathy is not to be used as an end-point for determining non-carcinogenic hazard.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>In the presence of air, a number of common flavour and fragrance chemicals can form peroxides surprisingly fast. Antioxidants can in most cases minimise the oxidation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fragrance terpenes are generally easily oxidised in air. \u00a0Non-oxidised limonene, linalool and caryophyllene turned out to be very weak sensitizers, however after oxidation limonene hydroperoxide and linalool hydroperoxide are strong sensitizers. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time. Autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes greatly to fragrance allergy, which emphasizes the need of testing with compounds that patients are actually exposed to and not only with the ingredients originally applied in commercial formulations.</p> <p>Peroxidisable terpenes and terpenoids should only be used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level, for instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production. Such products should have a peroxide value of less than 10 millimoles peroxide per liter. This requirement is based on the published literature mentioning sensitising properties when containing peroxides.</p>",
