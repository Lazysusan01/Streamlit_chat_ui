                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression is seen at styrene exposures exceeding 50 ppm, whilst headache, fatigue, nausea and dizziness are reported consistently at exposures of 100 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Eye and throat irritation occurred in human volunteers exposed to 376 ppm styrene for 1 hour and was accompanied by increased nasal secretion at exposures of 800 ppm for 4 hours. At the end of an 8-hour workshift, workers exposed to 212 ppm styrene had higher urinary levels of alanine-aminopeptidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase than unexposed workers, indicating potential renal effects of styrene .</p> <p>Evidence exists that 5% to 10% reductions in sensory nerve conduction occur at 100 ppm and that slowed reaction times occur after exposure to 50 ppm. Exposure at 370 ppm produces unpleasant subjective symptoms and signs of neurological impairment. High vapour concentrations may have a toxic and anaesthetic effect which may lead to unconsciousness or death. Exposure at 1000 ppm can rapidly lead to unconsciousness whilst exposure to 10000 ppm may cause death in less than one hour. Simple reaction times were increased and coordination decreased amongst volunteers inhaling 350 ppm (via mouth tube) for 30 minutes. Controlled inhalation studies with 300 ppm (via mouth tube) for one hour found reduced ocular tracking abilities but no changes in balance or coordination.</p> <p>In humans exposed to styrene vapor, pulmonary retention is approximately 66% of the administered concentration.</p> <p>Following inhalation exposure, styrene is preferentially distributed to adipose tissue. Fat levels in rats were 10-times greater than levels in observed organs after exposure to 50-2000 ppm for 5 hours.</p> <p>Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of styrene. In humans, the main urinary metabolites are mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid; rats also excrete hippuric acid and glucuronide. Human volunteers exposed by inhalation to 50 to 200 parts per million (ppm) showed biphasic urinary elimination of mandelic acid with a half-life for the first phase of 4 hours and for the second phase of 25 hours.

Styrene exposure causes liver and lung toxicity in mice and nasal toxicity in rats and mice.</p> <p>Chromosomal abnormalities (micronucleii, chromosome gaps or breaks, nuclear bridges and unscheduled DNA synthesis in peripheral lymphocytes) have been recorded in workers exposed to styrene. Such aberrations however are not always apparent in epidemiological studies and the status of styrene as a DNA effector is equivocal.</p> <p>Death due to cancers among workers exposed to styrene is statistically unremarkable.</p> <p>The dominant first metabolite of styrene is styrene-7,8-epoxide which binds covalently to DNA and shows activity in various in-vitro and in-vivo assays for genetic effects where it induces dose-related responses of chromosomal damage at low concentrations. Styrene-7,8-oxide is detected in the blood of workers exposed to styrene. Adducts in haemoglobin and DNA, DNA single-strand breaks/ alkali-labile sites as well as significant increases in the frequency of chromosomal damage have been found in workers exposed to styrene in the reinforced plastics industry.</p> <p>In humans there is little evidence for an association between workplace exposure to styrene and spontaneous abortions, malformations or decreased male fecundity.</p> <p>Spontaneous abortions amongst female worker, exposed to styrene, has been reported in some studies. \u00a0This finding has not been substantiated in other studies. Increased congenital malformations, embryonic foetal deaths or reduced birth weights have also been reported but simultaneous exposure to other substances makes the link to styrene conjectural. In rats, there is some evidence for reduced sperm count and peripubertal animals may be more sensitive than adult animals. Styrene crosses the placenta in rats and mice. It increases prenatal death at doses levels causing decreased maternal weight gain. Decreased pup weight, postnatal developmental delays as well as neurobehavioral and neurochemical abnormalities have been reported in rats exposed to styrene during pre- or postnatal development. The potential for developmental toxicity appears to be much higher for styrene-7,8-oxide, a metabolite.</p> <p>Rats given weekly doses of styrene by gavage at 500 mg/kg for 102 weeks showed liver, kidney, and stomach lesions; no effects were seen in mice. Reduced weight gain and increased liver and kidney weights occurred in rats receiving 285 or 475 mg/kg/day for 185 days but no effects at 95 mg/kg/day . Male and female rats were given 0, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg and male and female mice were given 0, 150, or 300 mg/kg by gavage for 78 weeks . Reduced body weight occurred in both treated male rat groups, high-dose female rats, and both treated female mouse groups. In another study, male and female mice were treated weekly with 1350 mg/kg . At 20 weeks, mortality was 50% and 20% for males and females, respectively accompanied by liver necrosis, splenic hypoplasia, and lung congestion. Male and female mice were exposed to 0, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 ppm styrene for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks . In both sexes the liver to body weight ratio was increased at the two highest doses; histopathology of the respiratory tract revealed metaplasia and degeneration of the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity at the lowest dose, necrosis at higher concentrations, and bronchiolar regeneration at all concentrations. Male and female rats exposed to 0, 125, 500, 1000, or 1500 ppm on the same schedule had increased liver to body weight ratios at the three highest levels in males and the two highest levels in females; degeneration of the olfactory epithelium occurred in both sexes at \u00a0around 1000 ppm. Pathological changes were observed in the respiratory mucosa of rats following exposure to 1000 ppm 4 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 weeks\u00a0</p> <p>Chromosomal abnormalities (micronucleii, chromosome gaps or breaks, nuclear bridges and unscheduled DNA synthesis in peripheral lymphocytes) have been recorded in workers exposed to styrene.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>aldehydes</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
