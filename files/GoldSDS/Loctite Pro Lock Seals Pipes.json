Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen chloride</p> <p>phosgene</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

More specifically,\r\nbisphenol A closely mimics the structure and function of the hormone oestradiol\r\nwith the ability to bind to and activate the same oestrogen receptor as the\r\nnatural hormone. The presence of the p-hydroxy group on the benzene rings is\r\nthough to be responsible for the oestradiol mimicry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">. Early developmental stages\r\nappear to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects and some studies\r\nhave linked prenatal exposure to later physical and neurological difficulties.\r\nRegulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety\r\nlevels are being questioned or are under review. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A 2009 study on Chinese workers\r\nin bisphenol A factories found that workers were four times more likely to\r\nreport erectile dysfunction, reduced sexual desire and overall dissatisfaction\r\nwith their sex life than workers with no heightened bisphenol A exposure.\r\nBisphenol A workers were also seven times more likely to have ejaculation\r\ndifficulties. They were also more likely to report reduced sexual function\r\nwithin one year of beginning employment at the factory, and the higher the\r\nexposure, the more likely they were to have sexual difficulties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bisphenol A in weak\r\nconcentrations is sufficient to produce a negative reaction on the human\r\ntesticle. The researchers found that a concentration equal to 2 ug/ litre of\r\nbisphenol A in the culture medium, a concentration equal to the average\r\nconcentration generally found in the blood, urine and amniotic fluid of the\r\npopulation, was sufficient to produce the effects. The researchers believe that\r\nexposure of pregnant women to bisphenol A may be one of the causes of\r\ncongenital masculinisation defects of the hypospadia and cryptorchidism types\r\nthe frequency of which has doubled overall since the 70's. They also suggested\r\nthat \"it is also possible that bisphenol A contributes to a reduction in\r\nthe production of sperm and the increase in the incidence of testicular cancer\r\nin adults that have been observed in recent decades\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One review has concluded that\r\nobesity may be increased as a function of bisphenol A exposure, which\r\n\"...merits concern among scientists and public health officials\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One study demonstrated that\r\nadverse neurological effects occur in non-human primates regularly exposed to\r\nbisphenol A at levels equal to the United States Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA) maximum safe dose of 50 ug/kg/day This research found a\r\nconnection between bisphenol A and interference with brain cell connections\r\nvital to memory, learning, and mood.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A further review concluded that\r\nbisphenol-A has been shown to bind to thyroid hormone receptor and perhaps have\r\nselective effects on its functions. Carcinogenicity studies have shown\r\nincreases in leukaemia and testicular interstitial cell tumours in male rats.\r\nHowever, \"these studies have not been considered as convincing evidence of\r\na potential cancer risk because of the doubtful statistical significance of the\r\nsmall differences in incidences from controls\". Another in vitro study has\r\nconcluded that bisphenol A is able to induce neoplastic transformation in human\r\nbreast epithelial cells.[whilst a further study concluded that maternal oral\r\nexposure to low concentrations of bisphenol A, during lactation, increases\r\nmammary carcinogenesis in a rodent model. In vitro studies have suggested that\r\nbisphenol A can promote the growth of neuroblastoma cells and potently promotes\r\ninvasion and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells. Newborn rats exposed to a\r\nlow-dose of bisphenol A (10 ug/kg) showed increased prostate cancer susceptibility\r\nwhen adults. At least one study has suggested that bisphenol A suppresses DNA\r\nmethylation which is involved in epigenetic changes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bisphenol A is the isopropyl\r\nadduct of 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl oxide (DHDPO). A series of DHDPO analogues\r\nhave been investigated as potential oestrogen receptor/anti-tumour drug\r\ncarriers in the development of a class of therapeutic drugs called\r\n\"cytostatic hormones\". Oestrogenic activity is induced with 1 to 100\r\nmg/kg body weight in animal models. Bisphenol A sealants are frequently used in\r\ndentistry for treatment of dental pits and fissures. Samples of saliva\r\ncollected from dental patients during a 1-hour period following application\r\ncontain the monomer. A bisphenol-A sealant has been shown to be oestrogenic in\r\nvitro; such sealants may represent an additional source of xenoestrogens in\r\nhumans and may be the cause of additional concerns in children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Concerns have been raised about\r\nthe possible developmental effects on the foetus/embryo or neonate resulting\r\nfrom the leaching of bisphenol A from epoxy linings in metal cans which come in\r\ncontact with food-stuffs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Many drugs, including naproxen,\r\nsalicylic acid, carbamazepine and mefenamic acid can, in vitro, significantly\r\ninhibit bisphenol A glucuronidation (detoxification).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">BPA belongs to the list of\r\ncompounds having this property as the rodent models have shown that BPA\r\nexposure is linked with increased body weigh (obesogens)t. Several mechanisms\r\ncan help explain the effect of BPA on body weight increase.\u00a0 A possible\u00a0 mechanism\r\nleading to triglyceride accumulation is the decreased production of the hormone\r\nadiponectin from all human adipose tissue tested when exposed to very low\r\nlevels (below nanomolar range) of BPA in cell or explant culture settings . The\r\nexpression of leptin as well as several enzymes and transcription factors is\r\nalso affected by BPA exposure in vivo as well as in vitro. Together, the\r\naltered expression and activity of these important mediators of fat metabolism\r\ncould explain the increase in weight following BPA exposure in rodent models.\r\nThese results also suggest that, together with other obesogens, low,\r\nenvironmentally relevant levels of BPA may contribute to the human obesity\r\nphenomenon.</span></p>",

Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%.

The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>CEL TWA: 1 mg/m3 [compare WEEL-TWA* for multifunctional acrylates (MFAs)]</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p> <p>Exposure to MFAs has been reported to cause contact dermatitis in humans and serious eye injury in laboratory animals.

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The material has<b>\u00a0NOT</b>\u00a0been classified by EC Directives or other classification systems as \"harmful by inhalation\". This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. In the absence of such evidence, care should be taken nevertheless to ensure exposure is kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used, in an occupational setting to control vapours, fumes and aerosols.</p><p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>No report of respiratory illness in humans as a result of exposure to multifunctional acrylates has been found.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>All multifunctional acrylates (MFA) produce skin discomfort and are known or suspected skin sensitisers. Aerosols generated in the industrial process are reported to produce dermatitis - vapours generated by the heat of milling may also occur in sufficient concentration to produce dermatitis. Because exposure to industrial aerosols of MFA may also include exposure to various resin systems, photo-initiators, solvents, hydrogen-transfer agents, stabilisers, surfactants, fillers and polymerisation inhibitors, toxic effects may arise due to a range of chemical actions.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health).

                "Environment": "<p>Surfactants are in general toxic to aquatic organisms due to their surface-active properties. Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p>",

Irritant effects range from minimal to severe dependent on the nature of the surfactant, its concentration and the duration of contact. Pain and corneal damage represent the most severe manifestation of irritation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen fluoride\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <ul> <li>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and related polyfluorinated polymers does not burn without an external flame.\u00a0</li> <li><font color=\"#ff0000\">WARNING: Wear neoprene gloves when handling refuse from fire where polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was present.</font></li> </ul> <p><b>CARE</b>: Contamination of heated / molten liquid with water may cause violent steam explosion, with scattering of hot contents.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material, during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage.

Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects following ingestion (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, adverse systemic effects have been produced following exposure of animals by at least one other route and good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Body content of titanium is presumed to be high (because titanium occupies fourth place in occurrence in the earth's surface) and is reported to be general in all organs of the body. Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). A further as yet unexplored mechanism may involve substitution by titanium for several metals (such as vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc) which perform essential biologic functions; all have a similar atomic radius</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Although,BIT has been shown to be hydrolytically stable with a half life of &gt; 30 days, it breaks down fairly quickly in aerobic soils. BIT shows moderate to strong binding to soils, with adsorption Kd values estimated to be between 1.24 and 9.56 \u00a0However, it breaks down aerobically on the surface soils. Since it has a moderate binding potential to soils, it is not likely to migrate into the ground and there is low potential for ground water contamination. Furthermore, with a Kow \u00a0value of 20 at 25 deg C, BIT is unlikely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Based on acute toxicity information, 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one displays low to moderate toxicity to birds and mammals.

Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Solutions of 0.5% strength 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one (BIT) are irritating to the skin. Allergenic effects also begin at 0.05% and have been confirmed in a series of case and patch test studies. When the substance was applied to human volunteers under an occlusive patch the maximum tolerated doses was 0.05%. Five hours after application of 0.1% (1000 ppm) one person showed moderate erythema with papule development which was interpreted as a reaction to the sticking plaster; in four persons there was mild reddening of the skin. The reaction had ameliorated in several persons after 72 hours. A second application produced various severe dermal reactions (erythema and papules) in 8 persons. A third application to several of the group produced erythema.</p> <p>Provocation tests with BIT showed the material to be sensitising. Of 20 metal workers with dermatitis, 4 were shown to have been sensitised to BIT in cutting oils. Cases of contact eczema in workers producing polyacrylate emulsions for paints and wax polish, in which BIT was the preservative, have been described. Epicutaneous challenge tests to BIT were positive. Similar findings have been described in the paper-manufacturing industry, in the rubber industry, in the control laboratory of a chemical plant and among workers producing ceramic moulds in which BIT was added to the mould oil</p> <p>Aqueous solutions of isothiazolinones may be irritating or even corrosive depending on concentration.

The material is not mutagenic. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study with rats, BIT did not produce excess tumours. The results derived from this test are questionable because no dose series was administered and because there were too few animals.</p> <p>A 90-day study with beagle dogs receiving oral doses showed reduced food consumption and body weight gain as well as mild anaemia, increases in the weights of liver and in male animals, brain and spleen weights.</p> <p>The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) was given as 165 mg/kg (ie 0.5 BIT in the diet).

In a multigeneration study using rats dietary saccharin induced transitional cell carcinomas and papillomas of the urinary bladder in the first generation male off-spring. Surgical insertion of pellets containing saccharin resulted in urinary bladder cancer in mice and urinary bladder carcinomas in female mice.</p> <p>Transplacental exposure of rats to sodium saccharin and saccharin did not produce treatment-related neoplasms. Pretreatment with a single instillation in the urinary bladder of a low dose of N-methyl-N-</p> <p>nitrosourea or feeding of N-(4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazoyl)formamide followed by oral administration of sodium saccharin increased the incidence of urinary bladder neoplasms in rats. Simultaneous administration of N-nitroso-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)butylamine and sodium saccharin produced significant increases in urinary bladder papillomas.</p> <p>The results of many case-control studies with humans have proved to be largely inconsistent. One large study showed a significant trend of increasing risk with increasing daily consumption in female non-smokers and male heavy smokers.

On a global scale, the level of man-made\r\nsynthetic amorphous silicas (SAS) represents up to 2.4% of the dissolved silica\r\nnaturally present in the aquatic environment.

On the basis of these properties it is\r\nexpected that SAS released into the environment will be distributed mainly into\r\nsoil/sediment, slightly into water, and probably not at all into air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With surface-treated SASs, the addition of organosilicon compounds\r\nincreases the hydrophobicity. Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Human experience shows defatting (drying) of skin, with no other chronic effects.|5542<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>The synthetic, amorphous silicas are believed to represent a very greatly reduced silicosis hazard compared to crystalline silicas and are considered to be nuisance dusts.</p> <p>When heated to high temperature and a long time, amorphous silica can produce crystalline silica on cooling. Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>aldehydes</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

Studies on the biodegradation of bisphenols have\r\nmainly focused on\u00a0 bisphenol A. A number of BPA-degrading bacteria have been\r\nisolated from enrichments of sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The first\r\nstep in the biodegradation of BPA is the hydroxylation of the carbon atom of a\r\nmethyl group or the quaternary carbon in the BPA molecule. Judging from these\r\nfeatures of the biodegradation mechanisms, it is possible that the same\r\nmechanism used for BPA is used to biodegrade all bisphenols that have at least\r\none methyl or methylene group bonded at the carbon atom between the two phenol\r\ngroups. However, bisphenol F ([bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane; BPF), which has no\r\nsubstituent at the bridging carbon, is unlikely to be metabolised by such a\r\nmechanism.\u00a0 Nevertheless BPF is readily degraded by river water microorganisms\r\nunder aerobic conditions.

Loss of the stem cell may result in  pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and  platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the  individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular  leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder  involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red  blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest.
