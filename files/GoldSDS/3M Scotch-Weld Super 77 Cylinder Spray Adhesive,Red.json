In the air, they are subject to rapid physical degradation through hydroxyl radical attack. Therefore, as a result of both biological and physical degradation processes, these products are not expected to persist in the environment</p> <p>Read across biodegradation data show that products in the HBNs have the potential to exhibit a high extent of biodegradability. The carbon number of products in this category ranges primarily between C5 to C11. Results for several chemicals, including benzene, with carbon numbers in this range that are contained by these products have been shown to biodegrade from 63 to 100% after 14 or 28 days, while results for several comparable, complex products containing several components range from 21 to 96% after 28 days.</p> <p>Hydrocarbons are not expected to hydrolyse at a measurable rate.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Read across aquatic toxicity data show that HBNs have the potential to produce a moderate level of toxicity in freshwater algae and acute toxicity in freshwater fish and invertebrates. The aquatic toxicity data \u00a0fall within a narrow range of values regardless of their varying chemical class content and carbon number range. This is not unexpected, because the constituent chemicals of products in this category are neutral organic hydrocarbons whose toxic mode of action is non-polar narcosis. The mechanism of short-term toxicity for these chemicals is disruption of biological membrane function. The existing fish toxicity database for narcotic chemicals supports a critical body residue (CBR, the internal concentration that causes mortality) of between approximately 2-8 mmol/kg fish (wet weight) , supporting the assessment that these chemicals have equal potencies. When normalized to lipid content, the CBR is approximately 50 umol of hydrocarbon/g of lipid for most organisms . Because the products in this category are all complex mixtures containing relatively similar series of homologous chemicals, their short-term toxicities are expected to fall within the range of toxicity demonstrated by the individual chemicals.</p> <p>The fish and invertebrate acute and alga toxicity values for individual chemicals and complex products similar to those in this category \u00a0fall within a range of approximately 1-64 mg/L and overlap between the three trophic levels. Because HBNs will range in paraffin, alkene, and/or aromatic carbon number content within approximately C5 to C11, a range in toxicity for products in this category is expected. Experimental data, this category will exhibit a moderate range of acute toxicity to fish and invertebrates and a moderate range of toxicity to algae. For representative chemicals and products, experimental acute fish toxicity values range between 2.5 to 46 mg/L for two species while acute invertebrate toxicity values range between 0.9 to 32 mg/L for one species .

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays. They were also non-genotoxic in\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>\u00a0mammalian testing for somatic or germ cell mutations (mouse micronucleus test and rat dominant lethal assay, respectively).</p> <p>Mullin et al: Jnl Applied Toxicology 10, pp 136-142, 2006</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas.

                "AcuteEye": "<p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience suggests, that the material may cause eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or is expected to produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Instillation of isoparaffins into rabbit eyes produces only slight irritation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Petroleum hydrocarbons may produce pain after direct contact with the eyes.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Dermally, isoparaffins have produced slight to moderate irritation in animals and humans under occluded patch conditions where evaporation cannot freely occur. However, they are not irritating in non-occluded tests, which are a more realistic simulation of human exposure. They have not been found to be sensitisers in guinea pig or human patch testing. However, occasional rare idiosyncratic sensitisation reactions in humans have been reported.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Repeated application of mildly hydrotreated oils (principally paraffinic), to mouse skin, induced skin tumours; no tumours were induced with severely hydrotreated oils.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>for dimethyl ether:</p> <p>The no-effect-level for dimethyl ether is somewhere between 2000 ppm (rabbits) and 50,000 ppm (humans) with possible cardiac sensitisation occurring around 200,000 ppm (dogs). The AIHA has adopted a safety factor of 100 in respect to the 50,000 ppm level in its recommendation for a workplace environmental exposure level (WEEL) which is thought to protect against both narcotic and sensitising effects. This level is consistent with the TLV-TWA of 400 ppm for diethyl ether and should be easily achievable using current technologies. The use of the traditionally allowable excursion of 1.25 to the level of 6.25 ppm is felt to be more than adequate as an upper safe limit of exposure.</p> <p>Human data:</p> <p>50,000 ppm (12 mins): Feelings of mild intoxication.</p> <p>75,000 ppm (12 mins): As above plus slight lack of attenuation.</p> <p>82,000 ppm (12 mins): Some incoordination, slight blurring of vision</p> <p>(30 mins): As above plus analgesia of the face and rushing of blood to the face.</p> <p>100,000 ppm (10-20 mins): Narcotic symptoms; (64 mins): Sickness (assumed to be nausea)</p> <p>144,000 ppm (36 mins):Unconsciousness</p> <p><br /></p> <p>May act as a simple asphyxiants; these are gases which, when present in high concentrations, reduce the oxygen content in air below that required to support breathing, consciousness and life; loss of consciousness, with death by suffocation may rapidly occur in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.</p> <p><b>CARE</b>: Most simple asphyxiants are odourless or possess low odour and there is no warning on entry into an oxygen deficient atmosphere. If there is any doubt, oxygen content can be checked simply and quickly. It may not be appropriate to only recommend an exposure standard for simple asphyxiants rather it is essential that sufficient oxygen be maintained. Air normally has 21 percent oxygen by volume, with 18 percent regarded as minimum under normal atmospheric pressure to maintain consciousness / life. At pressures significantly higher or lower than normal atmospheric pressure, expert guidance should be sought.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Ethers produce narcosis following inhalation.</p> <p>Inhalation of lower alkyl ethers may result in central nervous system depression or stimulation, intoxication, headache, dizziness, weakness, blurred vision, seizures and possible coma. Cardiovascular involvement may produce hypotension, bradycardia and cardiovascular collapse, whilst respiratory symptoms might include irritation of nose and throat, cough, laryngeal spasm, pharyngitis, irregular respiration, depression, pulmonary oedema and respiratory arrest. Nausea, vomiting and salivation might also indicate overexposure.</p> <p>Convulsions, respiratory distress or paralysis, asphyxia, pneumonitis, and unconsciousness are all serious manifestations of poisoning. Fatalities have been reported. Kidney and liver damage with interstitial cystitis may result from massive exposures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>Symptoms of asphyxia (suffocation) may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and ringing in the ears. If the asphyxia is allowed to progress, there may be nausea and vomiting, further physical weakness and unconsciousness and, finally, convulsions, coma and death. Significant concentrations of the non-toxic gas reduce the oxygen level in the air. As the amount of oxygen is reduced from 21 to 14 volume %, the pulse rate accelerates and the rate and volume of breathing increase. The ability to maintain attention and think clearly is diminished and muscular coordination is somewhat disturbed. As oxygen decreases from 14-10% judgement becomes faulty; severe injuries may cause no pain. Muscular exertion leads to rapid fatigue. Further reduction to 6% may produce nausea and vomiting and the ability to move may be lost. Permanent brain damage may result even after resuscitation at exposures to this lower oxygen level. Below 6% breathing is in gasps and convulsions may occur. Inhalation of a mixture containing no oxygen may result in unconsciousness from the first breath and death will follow in a few minutes.</p> <p>The primary physiological effect which follows exposure to diethyl ether is acute narcosis.</p> <p>Inhalation at about 7.5%, in air, produces mild intoxication in about 12 minutes. Longer exposures and exposure to higher concentrations produces incoordination, blurring of vision, headache, dizziness and unconsciousness (20% produces unconsciousness in about 20 minutes). Heavy exposures may be lethal and deaths occur due to depression of the respiratory system. Dimethyl ether is a weak cardiac sensitiser in dogs.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Alkyl ethers may defat and dehydrate the skin producing dermatoses.

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

In view of the high vapour pressure and moderate\r\nadsorption to soil, volatilisation from soil and surfaces should be\r\nconsiderable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelus 4.53 mg/l (flow through);\r\nLepomis macrochirus 34.72 mg/l; Poecilia reticulata 48 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Daphnia EC50 (48 h): 400 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Algal EC50 (72 h): Scenedesmus subspicatus &gt;500 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (5 min) 85.5 mg/l; (10 min) 93\r\nmg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

As with many alkanes, experimental methods for the estimation\r\nof the Koc parameter are lacking, so that estimates must be made based on\r\ntheoretical considerations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The dominant transport process from water is volatilization. Based\r\non mathematical models the half-life for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane in bodies of\r\nwater with any degree of turbulent mixing (e.g., rivers) would be less than 3\r\nhours. For standing bodies of water (e.g. small ponds), a half-life no longer\r\nthan one week (6.8 days) is estimated Based on the log octanol/water partition\r\ncoefficient (i.e. log[Koc]) and the estimated log sorption coefficient (i.e.\r\nlog[Koc])\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is not expected to become concentrated in biota.\r\nA calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 453 for a fathead minnow further\r\nsuggests a low potential for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane to bioconcentrate or\r\nbioaccumulate in trophic food chains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In soil, the dominant transport mechanism for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\npresent near the surface probably is volatilisation (based on its Henry\u2019s law\r\nconstant, water solubility, vapor pressure, and Koc). While its estimated Koc\r\nvalues suggest a moderate ability to sorb to soil particles,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nhas a density (0.6603 g/mL at 20 C) well below that of water and a very low\r\nwater solubility of 9.5 mg/L.\u00a0<i>n-</i>Hexane would, therefore, be viewed\r\nas a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), which would suggest a low potential\r\nfor leaching into the lower soil depths since the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane would\r\ntend to float on the top of the saturated zone of the water table.\u00a0<i>n-</i>Hexane\r\nwould generally stay near the soil surface and, if not appreciably sorbed into\r\nthe soil matrix, would be expected eventually to volatilise to the atmosphere.\r\nExceptions would involve locations with shallow groundwater tables where there\r\nwere large spills of hexane products. In such cases, the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\ncould spread out to contaminant a large volume of soil materials.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><i><span style=\"color:black\">n-</span></i><span style=\"color:black\">Hexane\r\ndoes not absorb ultraviolet (UV) light at 290 nm and is thus not expected to\r\nundergo direct photolysis reactions. The dominant tropospheric removal\r\nmechanism for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is generally regarded to be decomposition by\r\nhydroxyl radicals. Calculations assuming typical hydroxyl radical\r\nconcentrations suggest a half-life of approximately 2.9 days. While\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\ncan react with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone precursors under controlled\r\nlaboratory conditions, the smog-producing potential of\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is\r\nvery low compared to that of other alkanes or chlorinated VOCs. Hydroxyl ion\r\nreactions in the upper troposphere, therefore, are probably the primary\r\nmechanisms for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane degradation in the atmosphere. As with most\r\nalkanes,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is resistant to hydrolysis</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Although few data are available\r\ndealing explicitly with the biodegradation of\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane in water,\r\nneither hydrolysis nor biodegradation in surface waters appears to be rapid\r\ncompared with volatilization. In surface waters, as in the atmosphere, alkanes\r\nsuch as\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane would be resistant to hydrolysis. Biodegradation\r\nis probably the most significant degradation mechanism in groundwater. The\r\nability of\u00a0<i>Pseudomonas mendocina\u00a0</i>bacteria to metabolise\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nin laboratory microcosms simulating groundwater conditions has been documented.\r\nMixed bacterial cultures as well as pure cultures are documented as capable of\r\nmetabolizing\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane under aerobic conditions. In general, linear\r\nalkanes (such as\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane) are viewed as the most readily biodegradable\r\nfractions in petroleum , particularly when oxygen is present in solution. Once\r\nintroduced into groundwater,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane may be fairly persistent\r\nsince its degradation by chemical hydrolysis is slow and opportunities for\r\nbiodegradation may be limited under anoxic conditions or where nutrients such\r\nas nitrogen or phosphorus are in limited supply</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Sediment and Soil:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The most\r\nimportant biodegradation processes involve the conversion of the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nto primary alcohols, aldehydes and, ultimately, into fatty acids. Similar\r\nprocesses are encountered with other light hydrocarbons such as heptane. In\r\ngeneral, unless the\u00a0<i>n</i>-hexane is buried at some depth within a soil\r\nor sediment, volatilisation is generally assumed to occur at a much more rapid\r\nrate than chemical or biochemical degradation processes. Once introduced into\r\ndeeper sediments,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane may be fairly persistent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): Oncorhyncus mykiss 4.14 mg/l; Pimephales\r\npromelus 2.5 mg/l (flow through); Lepomis macrochirus 4.12 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia EC50 (48 h): 3.87 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

They occur either as products of commerce (e.g. 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-heptanedione, 3,6-octanedione) or as metabolites (of, for example, n-hexane and 2-hexanone). The neurotoxic syndrome is best described as a sensorimotor or motor polyneuropathy. The initial symptoms are symmetrical sensory numbness and paraesthesias of the distal portions of the extremities. Sensory loss usually involves all modalities of the feet or hands. Motor weakness is typically observed in the muscles of the toes and fingers but may also involve the muscles of arms, thighs and forearms. Onset of symptoms may be delayed for several months to a year after the initial exposure. Pathologically the syndrome is characterised by a swelling of the axon, demyelination and nerve fibre degradation resembling a dying-back neuropathy.</p> <p>Central and autonomic nervous systems are unaffected.</p> <p>The clinical course of the disease following removal from exposure is complete recovery, but severe cases may retain sensorimotor deficits.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For isobutane:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Refrigerant Gas: Saturated Hydrocarbons have zero ozone depletion\r\npotential (ODP) and will photodegrade under atmospheric conditions.\r\n&nbsp;[Calor Gas]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental Fate</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Terrestrial fate:&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>&nbsp;An\r\nestimated Koc value of 35 suggests that isobutane will have very high mobility\r\nin soil.

Volatilisation of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07x10-1 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg, and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L. Propane is expected to volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using cell suspensions of microorganisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidised to acetone within 24 hours, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>The estimated Koc value indicates that propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law constant volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are estimated to be 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively. \u00a0An estimated BCF of 13.1 using log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. After 192 hr, the trace concentration of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate</b>:: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour pressure, propane is expected to exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>No health effects were seen in humans exposed at 1,000 ppm isobutane for up to 8 hours or 500 ppm for 8 hours/day for 10 days.

Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic.

Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
