Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Analytical studies of hydrolysis products indicate that the molecule cleaves at the aromatic carbon-nitrogen bond.\u00a0</p> <p>It is difficult to define clearly the ways in which phenylenediamines are eliminated from the hydrosphere. Elimination processes such as oxidation reactions, adsorption, and stripping effects can only be conjectured. It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty for any of the three isomers what proportion of their elimination is accounted for by biodegradation. The following elimination rates have been found: between 0 and 69 % for o-phenylenediamine, between 0 and 60 % for m-phenylenediamine and between 0 and 100 % for p-phenylenediamine. It is assumed that any phenylenediamines released into the atmosphere are destroyed by photodegradation. The calculated half-life is less than 2 hours. The low POW values indicate that bioaccumulation is unlikely to occur to any significant degree. Only one study has dealt with the behaviour of phenylenediamines in soil, in respect to their soil sorption and geoaccumulation. According to this study, adsorption is relatively strong at low concentrations and expandable clay minerals</p> <p>but quite weak at higher concentrations. No information is available on the sorption behaviour against organic material.</p> <p>The substituted p-phenylenediamines and presumably the other isomers, in general, are very toxic to aquatic organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>Aromatic amines (arylamines), particularly primary aromatic amines, covalently and irreversibly bind to humic substances present in most natural waters.</p> <p>All metabolites with moieties of: anilines, benzidines and toluidines are of environmental concern. Anilines and benzidines are both acutely toxic and toxic depending on the specific aquatic species (except algae). Toluidines represent a similar concern, It has been speculated that aqueous solutions of aromatic amines can be oxidised by organic radicals, but there are no actual data on reaction rates. Based on a study of reaction rate data for these compounds an estimate of the half-life of aromatic amines in water is approximately 100 days, assuming a peroxy radical concentration of 10-10 mole/L in sunlit, oxygenated water</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The sulfonamides are bipolar substances due to their polar\r\nfunctional groups with two pKa-values in the environmentally relevant pH-range.\r\nAt low pH-values they are cationic due to protonation of the aniline group\r\n(pKa1).

As a consequence of this speciation, the partitioning and the\r\nreactivity are pH-dependent which plays an important role for assessing their\r\nenvironmental behavior as well as for their extraction from different matrices\r\nfor chemical analysis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Antibiotic sulfonamides, a structurally related group of\r\nsubstances, contain a similar 4-aminobenzene sulfonamide backbone, and are used\r\nin agriculture, aquaculture, animal husbandry, and also as human medicines.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>After animal medication, they are excreted in high percentages of\r\nthe administered amount, either as active substance or as acetyl conjugate. In\r\nmanure, these sulfonamides are persistent. Furthermore the acetyl conjugates\r\nare cleaved into the active sulfonamide during manure storage, possibly by\r\nnucleophilic attack of ammonium at the carbonyl carbon. Concentrations ranging\r\nfrom 0.1 to more than 10 mg sulfonamide/ kg liquid manure translate into loads\r\nof some few grams to several hundred grams per hectare per application that may\r\nreach agricultural soils. On a plot scale, losses of sulfonamide antibiotics by\r\nsurface run-off have been reported to vary from 0.1 to 28% of the applied\r\namount. One reason for this high variability might be the different irrigation\r\nintensities ranging from a few mm per day to 100mm/2h . In a field study\r\ncarried out on a macroporous tile-drained clay soil relative losses of a\r\nsulfonamide antibiotic amounted to 0.48% and 0.01% in two subsequent years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Competing with p-aminobenzoic acid in the enzymatic synthesis of\r\ndihydrofolic acid, sulfonamides inhibit the growth and reproduction of\r\nbacteria. Once released to the environment, sulfonamides distribute themselves\r\namong different environmental compartments, along with their degradation\r\nproducts, and are transported to surface water and groundwater. The\r\nphysiochemical properties, the dosage applied and the nature of the\r\nenvironmental components with which they interact, govern the whole process.\r\nSulfonamides, as a class, are only partially sorptive, non persistent, and\r\nleachable . They cannot be characterised as readily biodegradable. Their\r\nadsorption to soil increases with the aromaticity and electronegativity of\r\nfunctional groups attached to the sulfonyl phenyl amine core.

A simple bacterial growth inhibition test was applied to show that the\r\nsulfonamides did not affect the bacteria at the concentration levels used. None\r\nof the compounds were degraded in the screening test, leading to the conclusion\r\nthat sulfonamides cannot be classified as readily biodegradable. In the\r\nsimulation test, primary degradation of mixtures of four compounds at\r\nconcentration levels of 250 to 500 \u00b5g/L were tested and analysed using\r\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography. Biodegradation occurred after lag\r\nphases of 7 to 10 d at 20\u00b0C when nonadapted sludge was applied. Test compounds\r\nwere degraded within a few days. At 6\u00b0C, degradation lag phases and degradation\r\nrates were three to four times longer. Sulfonamide adapted bacterial cultures\r\nwere able to degrade either the same compounds as previously added or four\r\nother sulfonamides in a rapid and uniform way (t\u00bd from 0.2 to 3 d). This\r\nfinding shows that if capable of degrading one sulfonamide substance, these\r\nbacteria may also degrade many other sulfonamides. In practice, this implies\r\nthat because the biodegradation rate is found to be identical for several\r\nsulfonamides in the sludge, the compounds may be assessed as a group by\r\nstudying only a few compounds in applications such as environmental fate\r\nassessments. The mechanism for inducement of sulfonamide adaptation to the\r\nbacteria was not revealed in this study.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>&nbsp;Flemming Ingerslev and Bent Halling-S\u00f8rensen: Environmental\r\nToxicology and Chemistry pp 2467-2473.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Laboratory tests showed that phototoxicity resulting from exposure\r\nto continuous UVB light generally increased the acute toxicity of the sulfonamides\r\nin D. magna by up to 2.3-fold. However, pulsed UVB exposure resulted in a\r\ngreater increase in phototoxicity. Compared to fluorescent light only (no UVB),\r\npulsed UVB irradiation (96 h) resulted in 12.0-, 5.8-, and 4.4-fold increases\r\nin toxicity for sulfamethazine, sulfathiazole, and sulfamethoxazole,\r\nrespectively. This suggests that the mode of UV irradiation is more important\r\nthan the dose (UV-intensity \u00d7 exposure time) for the photo-enhancement of\r\nsulfonamide toxicity. Natural sunlight enhanced the toxicity of the\r\nsulfonamides to an even greater degree, likely because of the contribution of\r\nUVA light. This study suggests that without taking into account the effects of\r\nUV irradiation, it is possible to underestimate the actual consequences of\r\nphototoxic sulfonamide antibiotics in the aquatic environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Jinyong Jung et al: Earth and Environmental Science.

Haemolytic anaemia may also result from use or exposure. Overdose may cause acidosis or hypoglycaemia with confusion and coma resulting. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in predisposed individuals including those who have been sensitised by topical application. Deaths associated with therapies based on sulfonamide appear to be a result of hypersensitivity reaction, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia, other blood dyscrasias and renal and hepatic failure. Doses of 2 to 5 gms have produced toxicity and fatalities. Pathological findings include crystalluria, and necrotic or inflammatory lesions of the heart, liver, kidneys, bone marrow or other organs. Sulfonamides may damage the stem cell which acts as the precursor to components of the blood. Loss of the stem cell may result in pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest. Aplastic anaemia develops due to complete destruction of the stem cells. Sulfonamides cross the placental barrier, are excreted in the breast milk and may produce adverse effects in the foetus/ embryo and newborn including agranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia, jaundice and kernicterus.</p>",

In contrast to m-phenylenediamine, for which binding to DNA in the kidney and liver has been described, p-phenylenediamine was found to bind to protein in the liver but not to DNA.

Studies of the damaging effect of o-phenylenediamine on DNA and chromosomes in mammalian cells produced predominantly positive results, even without metabolic activation. The damaging effects of m- and p-phenylenediamine on DNA and chromosomes, however, vary according to the test system, and both positive and negative findings have been obtained.

Renal effects are often prominent and may include crystalluria, haematuria, proteinuria, pain and frequent urination, necrosis of the tubules, nephritic syndrome, and toxic necrosis with oliguria or anuria with azotemia. Neurologic effects include headache, drowsiness, insomnia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, mental depression, hallucinations, ataxia, muscular paralysis, peripheral neuropathy, transient lesions of the posterior spinal column, transverse myelitis, convulsions and unconsciousness. Haematological effects include eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, megoblastic anaemia, Heinz body anaemia and aplastic anaemia; petechiae and purpura may result. Acute haemolytic anaemia may also result (possibly as a result of hypersensitivity reactions) with people of African descent apparently more susceptible than Europeans - glucose-6-phosphate deficiency also appears to be a factor. Methaemoglobinaemia, sulfhaemoglobinaemia and cyanosis may also occur. Ocular effects may include acute transient myopia, keratitis and conjunctivitis with inflammation and chemosis accompanied by swelling of the lids and in more severe cases, photophobia. Cross-sensitivity amongst the sulfonamides is common and allergic reaction may occur following systemic use or topical application. Sensitisation may produce generalised skin eruptions, urticaria and pruritus. Stevens-Johnson syndrome; a severe form of erythema multiforme associated with wide-spread lesions of the skin, mucous membranes and which may be fatal in about 25% of cases, has occurred in patients treated with sulfonamides. This syndrome may produce conjunctival and corneal scarring, serum sickness, periorbital oedema, angioedema, arthritis, arthralgia, allergic myocarditis, decreased pulmonary function and eosinophilic pneumonia. Other effects of long-term therapy include fever, chills, alopecia, vasculitis, lupus erythematosus, oligospermia, infertility, hypothyroidism and on occasion, goiter and diuresis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0More severe responses to treatment include irreversible neuromuscular and central nervous system changes and fibrosing alveolitis. During sulfonamide treatment, direct exposure to sunlight should be avoided as photosensitisation dermatitis may develop. This form of phototoxic dermatitis may be contrasted to photoallergic dermatitis produced by specific sensitising agents through immunological intervention. Phototoxic reactions have been described following contact, ingestion or injection of causal agents. The chemical may reach the skin by the circulatory system following ingestion or following parenteral administration. The actual skin changes vary with the agent and circumstances of the exposure. Swelling and redness (erythema) frequently occur, and blistering may also result; increased skin temperature and pruritus may follow. This is analagous to irritant contact dermatitis and occurs immediately following contact.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Hyperpigmentation may also follow the reaction. Photodermatitis of this type requires activation of a chemical substance on the skin surface by UV radiation (290 to 490 nm wavelength) for its clinical expression. In all cases, inflammation develops on the body surfaces normally exposed to sunlight (dorsal hands, arms, neck, face), provided that the responsible photosensitiser also contacts the anatomic areas. Covered skin, the eyelids, submental chin and upper ears covered by hair, are characteristically spared. Phototoxic reactions, analogous to irritant contact dermatitis, are typically accompanied by immediate burning, stinging or \"smarting\" of the skin shortly following sun exposure, and clinical inflammation appears more like an acute sunburn than an eczematous dermatitis. Photoallergic dermatitis may result from contact with the material; this is characterised by an increased reactivity of the skin to ultra- violet (UV) and/or visible radiation produced by a chemical agent on an immunological basis and occurs after a latent period of days or months. This type of response can be elicited only in individuals who have been previously allergically sensitised to the chemical agent and appropriate radiation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Photoallergic dermatitis is relatively rare (certainly more so than phototoxic dermatitis produced by non-immunological principals) and presents, clinically, as an eczematous dermatitis in sun-exposed areas (distinguishing it from phototoxic dermatitis which is analogous to contact irritant dermatitis and produces swelling, redness and even blistering); photoallergic dermatitis may eventually spread to areas covered by clothes. Lichenification (thickening with increased skin markings) and chronic pigmentary changes may also develop. Photoallergic reactions may sometimes be followed by a persistent state of light reactivity (persistent light reactor) where clinical dermatitis recurs following exposure to sunlight alone, in the absence of the original initiating chemical. Studies in rats have shown that long-term administration of sulfonamides may produce thyroid malignancies; rats, however, appear to be more susceptible to the goiterogenic effects of sulfonamides than do other animal species. Sulfonamides may cause kernicterus in the neonate and their use is not recommended during pregnancy. Studies in rats and mice given high oral doses have shown that certain sulfonamides cause a significant incidence of cleft palate and other bony abnormalities in the foetus.</p>",
