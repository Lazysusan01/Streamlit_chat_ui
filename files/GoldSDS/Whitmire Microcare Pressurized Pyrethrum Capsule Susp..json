Vapor phase pyrethrins are rapidly degraded in the atmosphere by direct photolysis and reaction with oxidants found in air such as photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrate radicals.</p> <p>Since all six pyrethrins are structurally very similar, they are expected to have similar environmental fate properties. Pyrethrin 1 was selected as a surrogate for all the pyrethrins to generate the environmental fate data, because it is difficult to evaluate the environmental fate properties of a mixture. Based on structure analysis, degradates of pyrethrins are expected to lose their toxicological activity and are not considered in this risk assessment. The major routes of dissipation for pyrethrins in the environment are photolysis (both in water and soil, with half lives of less than one day in both cases) and to a lesser degree, aerobic soil metabolism. Hydrolysis under alkaline conditions is an important route of dissipation for pyrethrins in water (half-life at pH 9 is 14-17 hours); however, this reaction appears to be relatively slow under neutral or acidic conditions, which are more likely to occur in the environment.\u00a0</p> <p>Pyrethrins are generally unstable in the presence of light, are hydrolysed rapidly under alkaline conditions and oxidise rapidly in air.</p> <p>Pyrethrins are more persistent to anaerobic microbial metabolism (t1.2= 86.1 days) than aerobic microbial metabolism (t1/2 = 10.5 days). They adsorb strongly to soil surfaces and are generally considered immobile in soils (Koc range 12,400 to 37,840); therefore, the potential to leach into groundwater is considered low. Since light is attenuated as a function of depth from the soil surface, photolysis of pyrethrins is only an important environmental fate process at the surface of the soil. The potential for significant toxicity is not reached in fields. Pyrethrins could reach surface water via spray drift or runoff events accompanied by erosion where they quickly adsorb to suspended solids in the water column, and partition into the sediment. Non-degraded pyrethrins are likely to bind to sediment since they appear to persist under anaerobic conditions.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For technical grade active ingredient (TGAI)</p> <p>Fish LC50: freshwater species 5.1 ug/l; estuarine marine species 16 ug/l</p> <p>Invertebrates EC50: 11.6 ug/l</p> <p>Chronic toxicity studies were conducted with the TGAI only. Studies show that pyrethrins impair growth (length and weight) of freshwater fish (LOAEC of 3.0 ug/L) and reproduction of freshwater invertebrates (LOAEC of 2.0 ug/L). The chronic no observed adverse effect concentrations (NOAECs) for freshwater fish and invertebrates were reported as \u00a0.9 and 0.86 ug/L, respectively.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on log Kows the potential for bioaccumulation is thought to be low.</p> <p><b>Birds:\u00a0</b>Pyrethrins were practically non-toxic to avian species on an acute oral and dietary basis (oral LD50 &gt;2,000 mg/kg bw; dietary LC50 &gt;5,620 mg/kg diet).\u00a0</p> <p><b>Non-target beneficial insects:\u00a0</b>Honey bee studies suggest that pyrethrins are highly toxic to non-target beneficial insects\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic and terrestrial plants:</b>\u00a0It is unlikely that pyrethrins pose a phytotoxic concern based on the toxic mode of action on the sodium channels in insects. Plants lack these sodium channels and this mode of action would not cause phytotoxicity in plants.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Mixtures Toxicity:\u00a0</b>Toxicity tests on the formulated product (60.25% piperonyl butoxide (PBO), and 6.02% pyrethrins) showed a relative increase in toxicity for the same species when compared to tests on pyrethrins alone.</p> <p>Across all aquatic species tested, the formulated product was more toxic to fish and invertebrates on an acute basis than the TGAI. The greatest difference in toxicity was seen with the estuarine/marine invertebrates (e.g., shrimp).

Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>The material is not thought to produce respiratory irritation (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless inhalation of vapours, fumes or aerosols, especially for prolonged periods, may produce respiratory discomfort and occasionally, distress.</p> <p>Inhalation of pyrethrins may produce nausea, vomiting, sneezing, serious nasal discharge, nasal stuffiness and asthma. High concentrations may produce hyperexcitability, incoordination, tremors, muscular paralysis and death (due to respiratory failure).</p> <p>There have been some reports of transient facial tingling (paraesthesia) which lasts a few hours after exposure.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p><br /></p> <p>Although the liquid is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may produce transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn).</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis. The material is unlikely to produce an irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives .</p> <p>Skin contact with natural pyrethrins may result in severe dermatitis and may also be associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Absorption through the skin may result in a toxic syndrome similar to that produced by inhalation. Systemic effects, following skin absorption, may include liver and kidney damage. Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause central nervous system effects and allergic skin reaction.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of pyrethrins may produce nausea, vomiting, headache and other central nervous system disturbances. Excitation, muscular tremors and a period of shock may be followed by death. Dogs fed 5000 ppm of pyrethrum, for 90 days, developed dyspnae, tremors, ataxia and excessive salivation. An estimated fatal human dose is thought to be 100 gms. for a typical 70 kg man (1430 mg/kg).</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Chronic poisoning by natural pyrethrins may result in convulsion, tetanic paralysis, rapid and uneven heart beat, liver and kidney damage, or death.</p> <p>The natural pyrethrins may produce hypersensitivity, especially following previous sensitising exposure. In general, repeated exposures over 2 or 3 years are required to elicit a response and involve exposure to pyrethrum rather than its individual components (including pyrethrins). The sesquiterpene lactone (pyrethrosin) and the pyrethrum glycoproteins account for the immediate and delayed hypersensitivity seen in guinea pigs following a single injection of ground chrysanthemum in Freud's adjuvant. Mild erythematic vesicular dermatitis (with papules), pruritus, localized oedema (particularly of the face, lips and eyelids), rhinitis, tachycardia, pallor and sweating are the most common syndromes. An initial skin sensitisation can progress to marked dermal oedema and skin cracking. Pyrethrum dermatitis appears to increase in hot weather or under conditions were heavy perspiration is produced. The active ingredients of pyrethrum (except pyrethrin II) are inactive in patch tests. Those patients allergic to ragweed pollen are particularly sensitive to pyrethrin.</p> <p>Rats fed on a diet of pyrethrins for 5000 ppm for 2 years showed some signs of tissue damage including liver lesions, bile duct proliferation and focal necrosis of the liver cells. A no-effect level of 1000 ppm found in animal experiments correspond to a daily dose of 3600 mg/man.</p>",

One study found PBO in river water at a concentration of 9.7 ug/L. It is rapidly degraded when exposed to sunlight, with a degradation half life of about one day in soil exposed to sunlight, and 14 days in soil without sunlight. The rate of degradation is also affected by how much oxygen is in the environment (particularly in aquatic systems), moisture levels, and application methods. There is less information available about PBO's persistence indoors, but one study found that PBO persisted for at least two weeks after a cockroach treatment on toys and in dust in a kindergarten</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Piperonyl \u00a0is considered moderately toxic to fish, moderately to highly toxic to invertebrates (including crustaceans and insects), and highly toxic to amphibians. In one study, concentrations of less than one part per million (ppm) killed water fleas, shrimp, and oysters. It is also very toxic to a common type of earthworm. Ingested PBO has a low to very low toxicity in birds</p> <p>Not only does PBO kill organisms, it is known to interfere with the reproduction of many types of wildlife at much lower concentrations than those required for mortality. The bio-concentration potential for PBO is low but can be moderate in some aquatic organisms. PBO also inhibits the breakdown of toxic chemicals in wildlife and the soil, increasing the concentrations of other, more acutely potent, pesticides.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Chemical Watch Fact Sheet</p> <p>Designated as a marine pollutant in the International Marine Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG).</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>|Fish Toxicity: 3.4 ug/l 96 hour LC50 (mortality): Rainbow trout, donaldson trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss); (carp) 24h LC50: 5.3 mg/L *|Bird toxicity (starlings) LD50: &gt;100 mg/kg *                     [*Aventis]|Invertebrate Toxicity: 1600 ug/l 24 hour LC50 (mortality) Kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus).|Other toxicity: 1000 ug/l 96 day LC50 (mortality): Western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata triseria)|Not toxic to bees.|Toxicity Class EPA: IV",

At necroscopy in rats surviving to the end of the study, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas occurred in both sexes in a dose-related manner. A dose-related increase in thrombocythemia was seen in male rats. The authors * of this study concluded that the primary feature of chronic piperonyl-butoxide toxicity is hepatocarcinogenicity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>It is generally accepted that PBO does not demonstrate any significant potential for mutagenicity (genetic damage) but debate still exists.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>PBO weakens the immune system by inhibiting lymphocyte response. Lymphocytes are a class of white blood cells that consume potentially dangerous pathogens and release antibodies. Inhibiting lymphocyte response weakens the body's ability to defend against foreign invaders. Preventing the breakdown of toxic chemicals, may exacerbate potentially toxic effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>PBO has been shown to adversely affect a variety of reproductive functions. Two-generational laboratory studies on rats show that litter weight and size are less for mothers exposed to high concentrations of PBO, and there is an increase in birth defects and fetal death. In one study the difference in the average weight of PBO-exposed offspring immediately after birth is negligible, but 7-14 days post-natal is significantly greater for those mothers that are exposed to PBO than for those that are not. The U.S. EPA maintains that results for teratogenicity (the ability to produce birth defects) in animals have been mixed, and while some studies suggest some teratogenicity, most do not. PBO may also interfere with sexual development because the enzymes it inhibits are responsible not only for the breakdown of toxic chemicals but also for the metabolism of other compounds such as steroids, which include the sex hormones. Rats exposed to PBO over the course of two years experience an atrophy of the testes a decrease in weight of the seminal vesicles (sperm producing structures), and an increase in ovarian weights. There is no evidence that PBO affects fertility.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Data has shown that PBO alone interferes with enzymes that maintain homeostasis of sodium and calcium in the brain and nervous system, possibly affecting neural response. Additionally, it increases the neurotoxicity of other compounds. Despite this data, EPA believes that these neurotoxic effects are slight and maintains that PBO poses no neurological risk.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Behavioral changes have been noted with PBO as well. In a laboratory experiment, exposed rats experience more trouble navigating a maze than unexposed rats. The exposed rats travel longer distances and turned more frequently in the maze. PBO also induces changes in olfactory behavior of the offspring of exposed mothers. Offspring of exposed mothers are less likely to enter a compartment that smells like home than unexposed mothers. Exploratory behavior in mice increases as the dose of PBO they were treated with increased. This data shows that PBO has the ability to affect behaviors in mammals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Research on rats has found that PBO can cause intestinal ulcers and bleeding. Liver damage is common in studies,and kidney damage has been found as well. Long-term ingestion of PBO causes anemia, a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin (oxygen-transporting molecules) in blood, and increases the blood cholesterol level in rats. PBO can also damage the larynx, and there have been reports that it can cause labored breathing, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs, nasal bleeding, abdominal swelling, and loss of the ability to coordinate muscle movement. There has been a fair amount of investigation into the effects of dermal contact with PBO since it is used as a topical agent for lice, but there has been no evidence of it causing any local or systemic toxicity, and the amount of PBO absorbed from skin contact is characterized by some researchers as low.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>ChemicalWatch Fact Sheet</p> <p>Takahashi, O.,S. et al: Fundamental and Applied Toxicology: Vol 22., pp 293-303, Feb 1994</p>",

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

MGK-264 is immobile in clay soils (Koc=3106 in clay loam), which may serve as a sink. MGK-264 may partition to particulate matter in water. MGK-264 is stable to hydrolysis, direct photolysis, and soil photolysis. Aerobic and anaerobic soil metabolism are very slow (mean aerobic half-life was 341 days). The expected half-life in air is short (half-life = 1.4 hours), so long-range transport is not expected, and it is expected to be an aerosol rather than a gas. The combined persistence and mobility would predict MGK-264 being found in surface and ground water, however, limited monitoring shows no detections above the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 ppb.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50: 1.4-2.4 ppm</p> <p>Aquatic invertebrates EC50: 2.3 ppm</p> <p>MGK-264 is considered to be \"moderately toxic\" to freshwater fish and invertebrates on an acute basis\u00a0</p> <p>For birds, MGK-264 is practically nontoxic on an acute basis as no deaths were observed at any dose level..</p> <p>It is unlikely that MGK-264 would cause phytotoxicity in plants</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Animal studies with vinclozolin and procymidone show irregular reproductive development due to their function as androgen receptor antagonists that inhibit androgen-activated gene expression. Even with low doses of antiandrogenic pesticides, developmental effects such as reduced anogenital distance and induction of areolas were seen in male rats.</p> <p>The material may exhibit antiandrogenic activity or estrogenic activity in humans. Although increased levels of developmental or environmental estrogens have been linked to the increased incidence of prostate disease, chemicals with antiandrogenic activity are potentially of greater importance because androgens are critical to establishing the male phenotype Environmental chemicals with antiandrogenic activity offer profound implications with regard to recent clinical observations that suggest an increasing incidence of human male genital tract malformations, male infertility, and female breast cancer.</p>\n<p>During foetal and neonatal life, reproductive tract development is hormonally regulated, and the reproductive tract is in an undifferentiated state, lacking compensatory homeostatic mechanisms to prevent adverse effects of EDCs.This has the potential to alter the action of gonadal steroid hormones Thus, the organisational effects of EDCs on the developing reproductive tract can be permanent and irreversible. When EDC's upset the balance of hormones or otherwise delay, block or scramble necessary messages offspring may have abnormalities ranging from reproductive impairment, feminisation/ demasculinisation, embryonic deformities, and abnormalities in sexual development later in life.</p>\n<p>Exposure to antiandrogens, in rodents, during reproductive tract development induces malformations such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and Leydig cell hyperplasia, and permanent changes in sexually dimorphic structures, such as anogenital distance (AGD) and areola/nipple retention.</p>\n<p>Androgens are critical for specifying prostate development, with the foetal prostate sensitive to altered hormone levels and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that exhibit estrogenic or antiandrogenic properties. In later life EDCs may be the cause of prostatic inflammation (prostatitis). Prostatitis affects 9% of men of all ages, and &gt; 90% of cases are of unknown etiology.Most prostatitis cases are ascribed to unknown (nonbacterial) origins, and the symptoms, both acute and chronic, are common, bothersome, and burdensome in terms of health-related quality of life Prostatitis is a common feature of endocrine disruption by estrogenic and antiandrogenic chemicals.</p>\n<p>The role of the endocrine system and EDC's in cancerous tumor production in humans and wildlife is still unclear. Still, a sizable body of evidence links EDC's to certain types of cancer and impaired immune functions.</p>\n<p>Research suggests that endocrine -disrupting chemicals may in fact be much more common to many or most plastics than was previously realised. In 2011 researchers looked at 455 common plastic products and found that 70% tested positive for oestrogenic activity. After the products had been washed or microwaved the proportion rose to 95%. The study concluded:</p>\n<p>\"Almost all commercially available plastic products we sampled, independent of the type of resin, product, or retail source, leached chemicals having reliably-detectable EA [endocrine activity], including those advertised as BPA-free. In some cases, BPA-free products released chemicals having more EA than BPA-containing products.</p>\n<p>A 2011 study found that people are being exposed to high levels of BPS in cash register thermal paper receipts and many of the other products that engendered concerns about the health effects of BPA. The researchers found BPS in all the receipt paper they tested, 87 percent of the samples of paper currency and 52 percent of recycled paper. The study found that people may be absorbing 19 times more BPS through their skin than the amount of BPA they absorbed when it was more widely used.</p>\n<p>BPS appears to share similar problems to BPA in that it has been found to be an oestrogen hormone disruptor even at extremely low levels of exposure.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact to 2-ethyl hexanol may result in irritation, reddening and sensitisation. Repeated oral and dermal exposures to animals has resulted in adverse liver and kidney effects.</p> <p>Male and female rats receiving 1.25% 2-ethyl hexanol in the diet for 90 days showed evidence of kidney and liver effects.</p> <p>The material produces teratogenic effects in laboratory rats when administered orally to pregnant Wistar rats on day 12 of gestation (1 and 2 ml/kg). These rats were sacrificed on day 20; the percent surviving foetuses with malformations in had increased to 2% and 22.2% in the low and high doses groups respectively. Maternal toxicity may have been a factor. Two subsequent studies indicate that birth defects in rats do not occur following inhalation of the vapour at maximum saturation concentration (850 mg/m3), or dermally at 3 ml/kg doses. Preliminary evidence suggests that absorption through human skin occurs more slowly than in rat.</p>|When combined with pyrethroids the substance increases the toxicity of an insecticide by interfering with the breakdown and elimination from the body of the insect. When tested in rats, a commercial product, MGK-264 had little, if any, synergistic effect on the ability of the liver to detoxify pyrethroids by inhibition of liver enzymes. High oral doses administered to rats appear to reduce female fertility,|decrease litter sizes and reduce the growth of off-spring.|NOTE: There were no effects in 2-year feeding studies with rats  given 1000 ppm in the diet nor with pigs given 300 ppm.",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p>"

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays. They were also non-genotoxic in\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>\u00a0mammalian testing for somatic or germ cell mutations (mouse micronucleus test and rat dominant lethal assay, respectively).</p> <p>Mullin et al: Jnl Applied Toxicology 10, pp 136-142, 2006</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression.

This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted.

Once aspirated, the\r\nhydrocarbons can create a severe pneumonitis. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Rats given isoparaffinic\r\nhydrocarbons - isoalkanes- (after 18-24 hours fasting) showed lethargy and/or\r\ngeneral weakness, ataxia and diarrhoea. Symptoms disappeared within 24-28\r\nhours.</span></p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Repeated application of mildly hydrotreated oils (principally paraffinic), to mouse skin, induced skin tumours; no tumours were induced with severely hydrotreated oils.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

It is not readily\r\nbiodegradable, and it can take months or longer to degrade in surface waters,\r\nsoils, and sediments. Nonbiological degradation is negligible. Many products\r\nthat contain nonylphenol have \"down-the-drain\" applications, such as laundry\r\nand dish soap, so the contaminants are frequently introduced into the water\r\nsupply. In sewage treatment plants, nonylphenol ethoxylate degrades into\r\nnonylphenol, which is found in river water and sediments as well as soil and\r\ngroundwater. Nonylphenol photodegrades in sunlight, but its half-life in\r\nsediment is estimated to be more than 60 years. Although the concentration of\r\nnonylphenol in the environment is decreasing, it is still found at\r\nconcentrations of 4.1 \u00b5g/L in river waters and 1 mg/kg in sediments. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A major concern is that\r\ncontaminated sewage sludge is frequently recycled onto agricultural land. The\r\ndegradation of nonylphenol in soil depends on oxygen availability and other\r\ncomponents in the soil. Mobility of nonylphenol in soil is low.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation is significant in\r\nwater-dwelling organisms and birds, and nonylphenol has been found in internal\r\norgans of certain animals at concentrations of 10 to 1,000 times greater than\r\nthe surrounding environment. Due to this bioaccumulation and persistence of nonylphenol,\r\nit has been suggested that nonylphenol could be transported over long distances\r\nand have a global reach that stretches far from the site of contamination.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenol is not persistent in\r\nair, as it is rapidly degraded by hydroxyl radicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenol is considered to be\r\nan endocrine disruptor due to its ability to mimic estrogen and in turn disrupt\r\nthe natural balance of hormones in affected organisms.The effect is weak\r\nbecause nonylphenols are not very close structural mimics of estradiol, but the\r\nlevels of nonylphenol can be sufficiently high to compensate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The effects of nonylphenol in the\r\nenvironment are most applicable to aquatic species. Nonylphenol can cause\r\nendocrine disruption in fish by interacting with estrogen receptors and\r\nandrogen receptors. Studies report that nonylphenol competitively displaces\r\nestrogen from its receptor site in rainbow trout. It has a stronger affinity to\r\nthe E2 receptor than estrogen. Nonylphenol causes the feminization of aquatic\r\norganisms, decreases male fertility, and decreases survival in young fish.\r\nStudies show that male fish exposed to nonylphenol have lower testicular\r\nweight. Nonylphenol can disrupt steroidogenesis in the liver. One function of\r\nendogenous estrogen in fish is to stimulate the liver to make vitellogenin,\r\nwhich is a phospholipoprotein. Vitellogenin is released by the maturing female\r\nand sequestered by developing oocytes to produce the egg yolk. Males do not\r\nnormally produce vitellogenin, but when exposed to nonylphenol they produce similar\r\nlevels of vitellogenin to females. The concentration needed to induce\r\nvitellogenin production in fish is 10 ug/L for NP in water. Nonylphenol can\r\nalso interfere with the level of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) being\r\nreleased from the pituitary gland. Concentrations of NP that inhibit\r\nreproductive development and function in fish also damages kidneys, decreases\r\nbody weight, and induces stressed behavior.</span></p> <p>Surfactants are in general toxic to aquatic organisms due to their surface-active properties. Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For high boiling ethylene glycol ethers;</p> <p>These chemicals form a category based on similar structural, physiochemical and toxicological properties. Triethylene- and tetraethylene- glycol ethers represent typical members of the category. All category members can be represented by the generic molecular formula:</p> <p>HO(CH2CH2O)nR - n=2,3,4,5,6 and higher ethylene units and R=alkyl(methyl, ethyl, butyl etc.)</p> <p>All are high boiling liquids of low volatility and high water solubility. Higher molecular weight species and surrogates may be solids at ambient temperatures.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Estimated photodegradation hydroxyl radical rate constants \u00a0for category members are in close agreement. Photodegradation half-lives of triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE), tetraethylene glycol methyl ether (TetraME), and tetraethylene glycol butyl ether (TetraBE) (estimated using the EPIWIN/AOP model) have atmospheric photodegradation half-lives of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 hours respectively.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Ether groups are generally stable to water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. The ether function is hydrolysed by heating in the presence of halogen acids, particularly hydrogen iodide.</p> <p><b>Volatilisation</b>: The category members are highly soluble to miscible in water, possess high boiling points (in excess of 250 C) and low vapour pressures. The estimated Henry's Law Constants, fall in the narrow range of 3.54 E-14 to 3.67 E-13 m3* atm/mol at 25 C point to a limited volatilisation potential.</p> <p><b>Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The ethers in this category possess physical properties that suggest that once they enter the aqueous compartment, they tend to remain dissolved in water. Soil/sediment partition coefficients (Koc) of 10 have been estimated for TGBE, TetraME and TetraBE . These results suggest that the category members have uniformly high soil mobility. Thus, these products can leach from soil deposits to groundwater, but can also be transported to environments where aerobic biodegradation can take place.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>When released to water, some studies show that biodegradation of category members is reasonably rapid . OECD guideline studies indicate biodegradability (&gt; 90%) for TGBE (ready or inherent) and TetraME (inherent). However,another comparative biodegradation study of triethylene glycol methyl ether (TGME), triethylene glycol ethyl ether (TGEE) and triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE) indicate slower rates of biodegradation (from 47-71%). Altogether, the data suggest that different study methodologies provide variable results for the tri- and tetraethylene glycol ethers. No category members or surrogates that were tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>The category members have a limited potential to bioaccumulate (based on log Kow's ranging from -1.73 to +0.51, 20 C), and predicted bioconcentration factors, log BCF = ca. 0.50</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The data suggest that trimethyl, -ethyl and -butyl ethers and are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.</p> <p>The LC50 values for fish, Daphnia, and algae are 2,400 mg/l, \u00a02,210 mg/l, and &gt; 500 mg/l, respectively. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers. Due to the structural and physical similarities of TetraME and TetraBE with the other glycol ethers in the category, it is likely that these glycol ethers are also of low toxicity to aquatic species</p> <p>The toxicity of TGBE, TetraME, TGEE and TGME to bacteria also has been tested. In sewer microorganisms exposed to TGBE, TGEE and TGME for 16 hours, the LD50 values were &gt; 5,000, &gt;10,000 and &gt;5,000 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of TetraME required to cause inhibition of respiration of activated sludge is reportedly &gt; 12,500 mg/kg for 3 hours\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">The production and use of\r\nnonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates is prohibited in the European Union due\r\nto its effects on health and the environment. In Europe, due to environmental\r\nconcerns, they also have been replaced by more expensive alcohol ethoxylates,\r\nwhich are less problematic for the environment due to their ability to degrade\r\nmore quickly than nonylphenols. The European Union has also included NP on the\r\nlist of priority hazardous substances for surface water in the Water Framework\r\nDirective. They are now implementing a drastic reduction policy of NP's in\r\nsurface waterways. The Environmental quality standard for NP was proposed to be\r\n0.3 ug/l. Nonylphenols are registered on the REACH candidate list. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the US, the EPA set criteria\r\nwhich recommends that nonylphenol concentration should not exceed 6.6 ug/l in\r\nfresh water and 1.7 ug/l in saltwater. In order to do so, the EPA is supporting\r\nand encouraging a voluntary phase-out of nonylphenol in industrial laundry\r\ndetergents. Similarly, the EPA is documenting proposals for a \"significant\r\nnew use\" rule, which would require companies to contact the EPA if they\r\ndecided to add nonylphenol to any new cleaning and detergent products. They\r\nalso plan to do more risk assessments to ascertain the effects of nonylphenol\r\non human health and the environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In other Asian and South American\r\ncountries nonylphenol is still widely available in commercial detergents, and\r\nthere is little regulation</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for alcohol ethoxylates</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alcohol (alkyl) ethoxylates (AEs) are generally biodegradable and do not persist for any substantial period in the environment. They are not usually present a concentrations which might produce problems. Contamination of natural waters, however, should be avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The biodegradability of the alcohol ethoxylates (AE) is relatively unaffected by the alkyl carbon chain length and the number of EO units. The linear AE are normally easily degraded under aerobic conditions. Only small differences are seen in the time needed for ultimate degradation of linear AE with different alkyl chain lengths. AE with a typical alkyl chain (e.g., C12 to C15) will normally reach more than 60% degradation in standardized tests for \"ready\" biodegradability. The rate of biodegradation may however be determined by the length of the ethylene oxide (EO) chain. Longer EO chains decrease the bioavailability of the AE (to microorganism) due to increased hydrophilicity and molecular size, which limits the transport of the molecule through the cell wall. The biodegradation of branched AE tends to be slower than biodegradation of linear AE. The biodegradability of AE depends on degree and structure of the branching. The general trend is that the biodegradation decreases considerably with an increasing branching of the carbon chain. The biodegradability of alcohol alkoxylates (AA), similarly, generally decreases with an increasing number of PO units. AA containing 6 PO units did not pass the level required for ready biodegradability whereas the same alcohol containing 2 PO units attained 83% ThOD in the closed bottle test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mineralization observed in experiments with 14C-labelled surfactants suggests that almost complete degradation of linear AE may be expected in anaerobic digesters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available information suggests that alcohol ethoxylates can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic organisms. These effects vary by carbon chain length. Typical alcohol ethoxylate surfactant chain length ranges from 9 to 18 carbons and 3 to 8 ethoxylate groups. Toxicity generally declines as the number of ethoxylates increases</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A summary of chronic toxicity data from 60 studies conducted between 1977 and 2004 on fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plant and algae species states that alcohol ethoxylates\u2019 effects on aquatic species include reduced growth rates, impaired reproduction, and reduced survival of neonates, as well as acute mortality. Alcohol ethoxylates may cause diminished growth rates and reduced cell counts in algae species at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg/L .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The concentrations at which alcohol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality in aquatic species are similar to the concentrations at which nonylphenol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality. However, alcohol ethoxylates degrade more quickly in the aquatic environment to relatively non-toxic compounds, whereas nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation typically yields nonylphenol, which is toxic as well as persistent in the aquatic environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Algae constitute the group of aquatic organisms which appears to be the most sensitive to AE. The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. For the linear AE, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length of C13 ) and decreasing EO chain length. The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to invertebrates varies with EC50 values from 0.1 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.5 mg/l to 50 mg/l for the branched types. The toxicity is species specific and may vary between 0.29 mg/l to 270 mg/l for the same linear AE The most commonly used invertebrates for testing are\u00a0Daphnia magna\u00a0and\u00a0Daphnia pulex, and they are also among the most sensitive invertebrates to AE. Apparently, the toxicity of AE to invertebrates was not related to hydrophobicity as it is the case for algae. Some AE are very toxic to invertebrates, i.e., linear AE of C12-15 EO1-8 and branched AE with a low degree of branching, i.e. &lt; 10-25%. Branching of the alkyl chain reduces the toxicity of AE to invertebrates as also observed for algae.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to fish varies with LC50 values from 0.4 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.25 mg/l to 40 mg/l for the branched AE. For linear AE the toxicity increases with decreasing EO units. AE containing 7-11 EO groups are considered to be very toxic to fish (EC/LC50: 1 mg/l).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special interest are the aryl alcohol ethoxylates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A EU Risk Assessment Report (RAR) concluded that octyl- and nonyl- phenol ethoxylates are\u00a0not readily biodegradable but are inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As a group, these materials are generally toxic to fish with LC50s ranging, typically, between 1-6 mg/l.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special concern are the following families which are classified as\u00a0\"Environmentally Hazardous Substances\"\u00a0(Dangerous Goods Class 9) by either or both the ADR (Accord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Merchandises Dangerous par Route) and the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C 6-17 (secondary) with 3-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C12-15 with 1-3 moles of ethoxylation (1-6 moles of ethoxylation IMDG)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C13-15 with 1-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">New aquatic data suggests that alcohols C 8-9 branched with 3-10 moles of ethoxylation alcohols C 8-9 branched with &gt; 10 moles of ethoxylation should also be classified as\u00a0'harmful to the environment\".</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These alcohols may also be found linked to aromatic structures (in nonylphenol ethoxylates for example). The current consensus determines that such entities become Environmental Toxins by association.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>Environmental toxicity is a function of the n-octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Pow, log Kow). Phenols with log Pow &gt;7.4 are expected to exhibit low toxicity to aquatic organisms. However the toxicity of phenols with a lower log Pow is variable, ranging from low toxicity (LC50 values &gt;100 mg/l) to highly toxic (LC50 values &lt;1 mg/l) dependent on log Pow, molecular weight and substitutions on the aromatic ring. Dinitrophenols are more toxic than predicted from QSAR estimates. Hazard information for these groups is not generally available.</p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>There is sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between human exposure to the material and impaired fertility</p><p>There is sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between human exposure to the material and subsequent developmental toxic effects in the off-spring.</p><p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>The alkyl phenolics (which may occur as breakdown products of some polyethoxylated surfactants) have been implicated in a phenomenon which has apparently occurred since the mid 1960s, namely lower sperm counts and reduced fertility in males. Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",
