Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin.

Modified polyamides can offer faster cure speed, lower viscosity and improved chemical resistance<br />Polyalkylenepolyamines are among the most known and widely used classes of epoxy resin curing agent; ethylene polyamines include ethylene diamine (EDA), diethylene triamine (DETA), triethylene tetramine (TETA) tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) and polyethylene polyamines (PEPA) with the general formula:<br />H2N-CH2-CH2-NH(CH2-CH20NH)nH where n=1-10<br />These compounds are glycerol-like viscous liquid that are compatible with epoxy oligomers.<br />The advantages of these curing agents are their efficiency in cold curing of epoxy oligomers and the capacity of yielding polymer materials with a complex of fairly high strength characteristics, dielectric and adhesive, and waterproof properties. Common disadvantages of these curing agents are the high volatility and toxicity which makes these compounds hazardous in actual practice. The process of curing epoxy resins with ethylene polyamines often occurs too quickly and irregularly, and is accompanied by a great exothermic effect; in the case of large indiscrete masses, this can lead to localised overheating and thus, to degradation of the strength characteristics of the polymers. In addition these amines dilute epoxy oligomers poorly, as a result of which, their use is limited to potting and impregnating compounds and other epoxy compositions that are processed in the state of viscous flow.<br />The polyethylenepolyamine adducts with nitriles, alkylene oxides, aldehydes and ketones, as well as mono-, and diepoxides, have been widely used to overcome some of the disadvantages.<br />The combination of high functionality with different nature, basicity and activity of amino groups in these curing agents must in turn provide the polyreactivity of curing systems and the complex of useful performance properties of epoxy resins<br />Key Words<br />ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA) tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) and polyethylenepolyamines (PEPA)</p> <p>The material is produced by the reaction of aqueous ammonia with 1,2-dichloroethane. This process yields the entire family of ethyleneamines: ethylenediamine, piperazine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine and aminoethylpiperazine. These polyamines are produced as their hydrochloride salts, and must be neutralised, typically with aqueous caustic soda, to obtain the free amines. The by-product salt produced in the neutralisation step is separated and the individual products are isolated by fractional distillation. The commercial product contains trace amounts of the other ethyleneamines.</p> <p>The ethyleneamines may be used in a number of production processes:</p> <ul> <li>The reaction with polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride yields the corresponding polybutenylsuccinimides, which are ashless, dispersant- detergent additives for motor oil.\u00a0</li> <li>Polyamide -epichlorohydrin resins are produced by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with a polyamide, such as those formed by polymerisation of adipic acid and TETA.

Low vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constants suggest that these compounds are not expected to be in the vapor phase. Modeling suggests that all members of this cluster are likely to react rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radials with half-lives on the order of an hour, but with little material in the vapor phase, it is not expected to be a predominant removal pathway for these chemicals. Experimental data and results from estimation models indicate that all members of this cluster have the potential to biodegrade aerobically under environmental conditions. Fugacity models indicate that the members of this cluster are likely to partition predominately to soil and water. All chemicals in this cluster are expected to have low environmental persistence. Measured and estimated bioconcentration factors for members of this cluster indicate a low potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Evaluation of the available experimental and estimated aquatic toxicity data indicate acute toxicity to fish \u00a0is low. Daphnia aquatic toxicity is generally low. Algae appear to be the most sensitive organism with several members of the cluster having measured or estimated toxicity values indicative of moderate toxicity. Chronic toxicity for all cluster members is estimated; it is generally low for fish and algae, but high for daphnia.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for triethylenetetramine (TETA):</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">TETA is completely miscible with water forming an alkaline\r\nsolution (pH 10 at 10 g/l).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Amine adducts have much reduced volatility and are less irritating to the skin and eyes than amine hardeners.

These have been established after a literature search for reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL). In addition the US EPA's procedures for risk assessment for hazard identification and dose-response assessment as applied by NIOSH were used in the creation of such limits.

Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p>",

The formation of nitrosamines from such amines has not only been observed in animals models but, at least for certain compounds, in the workplace. The amine-containing substances and end products handled at work can themselves be contaminated to a degree with corresponding nitrosamines. Under conditions encountered in practice nitrosation is to be expected with secondary amines and to a limited extent with primary and tertiary amines. Nitrogen oxides are the most probable nitrosating agents. Nitrosyl chloride, nitrite esters, metal nitrites and nitroso compounds may also be involved. Several factors such as pH, temperature, catalysts and inhibitors influence the extent of nitrosation. Two precautionary measures are therefore necessary when handling amines at the workplace.</p> <ul> <li>Simultaneous exposure to nitrosating agents should be reduced to minimum. This can be out into practice by eliminating nitrosating agents or, if they play a role in the actual process, replacing them with substances that do not lead to the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. In particular the level of nitrogen oxides at the workplace should be monitored and reduced when necessary.\u00a0</li> <li>The levels of nitrosamines in the workplace and in substances containing amines should be monitored.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area, Report No. 31, DFG, 1995</p> <p>In animal experiments the oesophagus is shown to be the most important target organ for nitrosamines, independent of the route of application. The mechanism of this organotrophy cannot be explained sufficiently. The high oesophageal epithelium metabolic activation of nitrosamines, together with a comparatively low DNA repair, probably plays the most important role. In addition chronic stress factors, which lead to high stimulation of epithelial turnover, are a pacemaker for malignant progression. In some countries, the traditional consumption of extremely hot drinks leads to constant burns of the oesophagus, which increases the risk. Mate, a non-alcoholic brew, frequently consumed as tea in Uruguay, appears to be a high risk factor for oesophageal cancer</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p>",
