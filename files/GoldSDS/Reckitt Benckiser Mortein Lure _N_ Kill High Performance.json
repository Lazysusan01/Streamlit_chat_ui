Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour. A STEL is recommended to prevent mucous membrane and ocular irritation and prevention of acute depression of the central nervous system. Because of the wide variation in molecular weights of its components, the conversion of ppm to mg/m3 is approximate. Sweden recommends hexane type limits of 100 ppm and heptane and octane type limits of 300 ppm.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "Use": "<p>In perfumery/ flavouring.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Terpenes are a large and varied class of hydrocarbons produced primarily by a wide variety of plants, particularly conifers, though also by some insects such as swallowtail butterflies, which emit terpenes They are the major components of resins, and of turpentine produced from resin. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as terpinoids. Some authors will use the term terpene to include all terpenoids. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential of many types of plants and flowers. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives Vitamin A is an example of a terpene.</p> <p>Terpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of isoprene which has the molecular formula C5H8. The basic molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of that, (C5H8)n where n is the number of linked isoprene units. This is called the isoprene rule or the C5 rule. The isoprene units may be linked together \"head to tail\" to form linear chains or they may be arranged to form rings. One can consider the isoprene unit as one of nature's common building blocks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As chains of isoprene units are built up, the resulting terpenes are classified sequentially by size as hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, sesterterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hemiterpenes consist of a single isoprene unit. Isoprene itself is considered the only hemiterpene, but oxygen-containing derivatives such as prenol and isovaleric acid are hemiterpenoids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Monoterpenes consist of two isoprene units and have the molecular formula C10H16. Examples of monoterpenes are: geraniol, limonene, terpineol.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sesquiterpenes consist of three isoprene units and have the molecular formula C15H24. Examples of sesquiterpenes are:farnesol . The sesqui- prefix means one and a half.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Diterpenes are composed for four isoprene units and have the molecular formula C20H32. They derive from geranyl pyrophosphate. Examples of diterpenes are cafestol, kahweol, cembren and taxadiene (precursor of Taxol). Diterpenes also form the basis for biologically important compounds such as retinol, retinal and phytol.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Sesterterpenes, terpenes having 25 carbons and five isoprene units, are rare relative to the other sizes. The sester- prefix means half to three, i.e. two and a half.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Triterpenes consist of six isoprene units and have the molecular formula C30H48. The linear triterpene squalene the major constituent of shark liver oil, is derived from the reductive coupling of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Squalene is then processed biosynthetically to generate either lanosterol or cycloartenol the structural precursors to all the steroids.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Tetraterpenes contain eight isoprene units and have the molecular formula C40H56. Biologically important tetraterpenes include the acyclic lycopene, the monocyclic gamma-carotene, and the bicyclic alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Polyterpenes consist of long chains of many isoprene units.Rubber consists of polyisoprene in which double bonds are cis-. Some plants produce a polyisoprene with trans double bonds, known as gutta-percha</p>|Flavouring, fragrance and perfume materials. Used as solvent in cleaners and degreasers; solvent for resins, polymers, waxes; wetting agent. Manufacture of specialist resins. Sulfurised derivatives in lube oils.|[~Fragrance ~]",

Calculated lifetimes for the reaction of d-limonene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals range from 0.3-2 h based on experimentally determined rate constants. \u00a0The oxidation of limonene may contribute to aerosol and photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>Calculated lifetimes for the night-time reaction of d-limonene with nitrate radicals range form 0.9 to 9 minutes. \u00a0The daytime atmospheric lifetime of d-limonene is estimated to range from 12 to 48 min. depending upon local hydroxyl rate and ozone concentrations. Products produced from hydroxy radical reaction with limonene are 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene, a keto-aldehyde, formaldehyde, 3-oxobutanal, glyoxal and a C10 dicarbonyl. The same carbonyls, along with formic acid and C8 and C9 carboxylic acids, \u00a0may form in reactions with ozone. Ozonolysis of limonene may also lead to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides, which have various toxic effects on plant cells and may damage forests.</p> <p>Products of ozonolysis include bis(hydroxmethyl)peroxide, a precursor to hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of d-limonene with ozone in the dark results in the formation of 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene and formaldehyde. Reactions with nitrogen oxides produce aerosol formation as well as lower molecular weight products such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone and peroxyacetyl nitrate.</p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>\u00a0When released to the ground limonene is expected to have low to very low mobility in soil based on its physicochemical properties. The soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) calculated on the basis of solubility (13.8 mg/l, 25 C) and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (4.23) ranges from 1030 and 4780. The Henry's law constant indicates that limonene will rapidly volatilise from both dry and moist soil; however its absorption to soil may slow the process.</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate</b>: In the aquatic environment, limonene is expected to evaporate to a significant extent owing \u00a0to its high volatility. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of limonene from a model river ( 1 m deep, flow 1 m/s and wind speed 3 m/s) is 3.4 h. Some limonene is expected to absorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation and bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Limonene does not have functional groups for hydrolysis and its cyclohexene ring and ethylene group are known to resist hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of limonene is not expected in terrestrial or in aquatic environments. The hydrolytic half-life of d-limonene is estimated to be &gt;1000 days. Biotic degradation of limonene has been shown with some species of microorganisms such as\u00a0<i>Penicillium digitatum, Corynespora cassiicola, Diplodia gossyppina</i>\u00a0and a soil strain of<i>\u00a0Pseudomonans sp (SL strain).\u00a0</i>Limonene is readily biodegradable (41-98% degradation by biological oxygen demand in 14 d) under aerobic conditions in a standard test (OECD 301 C \"Modified MITI Test (1)\", OECD, 1981a; MITI, 1992). Also in a test simulating aerobic sewage treatment (OECD 303 A \"Simulation Test - Aerobic Sewage Treatment: Coupled Units Test\"; OECD, 1981b), limonene disappeared almost completely (&gt;93.8%) during 14 days of incubation.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation has been assessed under anaerobic conditions; there was no indication of any metabolisms, possibly because of the toxicity to micro-organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>The bioconcentration factor, calculated on the basis of water solubility and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Kow) is 246-262, suggesting that limonene may bioaccumulate in fish and other aquatic species.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b>\u00a0Technical limonene is practically nontoxic to birds on a subacute dietary basis, and is slightly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates on an acute basis.\u00a0</p> <p>for d-limonene:</p> <p>LD50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 16 weeks old) oral &gt;2000 mg/kg</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 10 day old) dietary &gt;5620 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Anas platyrhynchos (Mallard duck, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 80 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 71.4-88.7 ppm); static /92% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 568 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 437-852 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>EC50 Daphnia magna (Water flea, &lt;24 hr old; intoxication, immobilization) 17 ppm/48 hr (95% confidence limit: 11-33 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 966 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 740-1652 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 38.5 mg/L/96 hr; flow through /from table/ LC50</p> <p>Leuciscus idus (Golden orfe) 32 mg/L/48 hr /Conditions of bioassay not specified in source examined</p> <p>The acute toxicity of \u00a0d-limonene ranges from slight to high for aquatic organisms. The lowest acute toxicity values (EC50 or LC50) identified were approximately 0.4 mg/litre for Daphnia (US EPA, 1990b) and 0.7 mg/litre for fish (US EPA, 1990a,b). The no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for</p> <p>green algae is approximately 4 mg/litre (US EPA, 1990a). The acute toxicity (EC50 or LC50) of dipentene to Daphnia and fish is about 50-70 times lower than that for d-limonene (US EPA, 1990b).

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

In human patch testing, weak or moderate reactions (erythema, swelling) have been observed. Positive eczematous responses to purified limonene were observed in 5 of 16 previously sensitised to oil of turpentine. In one study, a 39-year old male immersed one hand in a jar of solvent, ensuring that inhalation exposure was minimal. After only few minutes of exposure, the subject experienced painful itching and burning. Itching decreased after the exposure but burning continued for 10 minutes. Swelling disappeared after 100 minutes. Six hours post-exposure, a purpuric eruption was observed; this persisted for several weeks. Blood concentrations during skin exposure were low compared to those during inhalation exposure.</p>",

They may result when d-limonene is unstabilised against oxidation, or upon prolonged standing at room temperature and/ or upon exposure to light, or when stabiliser levels diminish. The two major hydroperoxides in auto-oxidised d-limonene, \u00a0are cis- and trans- limonene-2-hydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-p-mentha-6,8-diene). In photo-oxidised d-limonene, they represent a minor fraction. Hydroperoxides may bind to proteins of the skin to make antigens either via a radical mechanism or after reactions to give epoxides. The cross-reactivity between the epoxide limonene-1,2-oxide, a potent contact allergen, and the hydroperoxides is NOT significant, indicating different mechanisms of sensitisation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0d-Limonene was considered to be weakly carcinogenic for the mouse fore-stomach epithelium, but not tumour producing. In 13-week and 2-year gavage-studies, male rats showed a range of compound-related kidney lesions including exacerbation of age-related nephropathy, mineralisation in the renal medulla, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium overlying the renal papilla and proliferation of the renal tubular epithelium. Neoplasms were believed to be caused by progression to tubular cell hyperplasia to tubular cell adenomas and, with increasing size, to adenocarcinomas or carcinomas. The similarity of the nephrotoxicity caused by trichloroethylene and N-(4'-fluoro-4-biphenyl)acetamide, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate in rats and the species specific nature of the response suggests that degeneration and necrosis of convoluted tubules may be associated with the accumulation of alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G). Since a2u-G is a species and gender-specific protein that is causal for both the cytotoxic and carcinogenic response in male rats, extrapolation of d-limonene carcinogenicity data from rat studies to other species (including humans) is probably not warranted. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G; they do however produce other related low molecular weight proteins capable of binding chemicals that cause a2u-G nephropathy in rats but this does not necessarily connote human risk. The Risk Assessment Forum of the USA EPA concluded;</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0Male renal rat tumours arising as a result of a process involving a2u-G accumulation do not contribute to the qualitative weight-of-evidence that the chemical poses a human carcinogenic hazard. Such tumours are included in dose-response extrapolations for the estimation of human carcinogenic risk.\u00a0</li> <li>If the chemical induces a2u-G accumulation in male rats, the associated nephropathy is not to be used as an end-point for determining non-carcinogenic hazard.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>In the presence of air, a number of common flavour and fragrance chemicals can form peroxides surprisingly fast. Antioxidants can in most cases minimise the oxidation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fragrance terpenes are generally easily oxidised in air. \u00a0Non-oxidised limonene, linalool and caryophyllene turned out to be very weak sensitizers, however after oxidation limonene hydroperoxide and linalool hydroperoxide are strong sensitizers. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time. Autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes greatly to fragrance allergy, which emphasizes the need of testing with compounds that patients are actually exposed to and not only with the ingredients originally applied in commercial formulations.</p> <p>Peroxidisable terpenes and terpenoids should only be used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level, for instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production. Such products should have a peroxide value of less than 10 millimoles peroxide per liter. This requirement is based on the published literature mentioning sensitising properties when containing peroxides.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen chloride</p> <p>phosgene</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Under laboratory\r\nconditions, it degrades more rapidly on sandy clay and sandy loam soils than on\r\nclay soils, and more rapidly in soils low in organic matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin rapidly degrades in sunlight with a half-life of 8-16\r\ndays.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin is not soluble in water and has a strong tendency to\r\nadsorb to soil particles. It is therefore unlikely to cause groundwater\r\ncontamination.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin has a very low vapor\r\npressure and is not readily volatilized into the atmosphere. A low Henry\u2019s Law\r\nConstant (H) , 2.5 x10-7 atm-m3/mol at 200 C, indicates that cypermethrin has\r\nalmost no tendency to volatilise from an aqueous solution. \u00a0Experimental\r\nresults indicate that there is practically no movement of cypermethrin from\r\ncontaminated soils to the surrounding air \u00a0unless bound to air-borne\r\nparticulates. Aside from drift that may occur with spray applications,\r\ncypermethrin is not expected to be found in air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Soil:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin occurs as a mixture\r\nof both the\u00a0<i>cis\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>trans\u00a0</i>isomers. The\u00a0<i>cis/trans\u00a0</i>ratio\r\nin technical grade cypermethrin is 1:1 . The\u00a0<i>cis\u00a0</i>isomers are\r\nmore active than\u00a0<i>trans\u00a0</i>by a factor of two. No significant\r\ndifference was observed between the photodegradation rates of the two isomers\r\nin soil, although the\u00a0<i>trans</i>-isomer was hydrolysed 1.2-1.7 times\r\nfaster . Hydrolysis and photolysis play major roles in the degradation of\r\ncypermethrin in soil. Hydrolysis of the esther linkage is the principal\r\ndegradation route and leads to the formation of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA) and\r\ncyclopropanecarboxylic acid derivatives \u00a0principally,\r\n3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (DCVA) .\r\nCypermethrin also photodegrades rapidly on soil surfaces to many byproducts,\r\nwith half-lives of 8-16 days . Many photoreactions are involved in\r\nphotodegradation and the photodegradation rates are closely correlated with the\r\norganic matter content of the soil . As with hydrolysis, the principal\r\nphotoproducts of cypermethrin are PBA and DCVA with &gt;15% recovery of each after\r\n32 days of irradiation . Under aerobic conditions, these metabolites may\r\nundergo further breakdown to CO2 at a much slower rate. The persistence of the\r\nmetabolites is unknown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin displays low water solubility, hence is hydrophobic.\r\nCypermethrin is a non-polar pesticide and readily adsorbed onto the soil\r\nsurface and bound there. Very little cypermethrin insecticide would move\r\nthrough the soil profile, although all of the degradation products are more\r\nmobile than the parent product. The degradates PBA and DCVA are organic acids\r\nwhich are often mobile in soil. The carbon content of the soil greatly affects\r\nthe amount of chemical that is adsorbed. Cypermethrin was found to have an\r\naverage Koc of 6.1 x 104 cm3/g for five different soil types \u00a0indicating that\r\ncypermethrin is immobile in soil. The major metabolites, on the other hand, are\r\nvery polar, and move readily through the soil. These organic acids varied in\r\ntheir mobility from intermediate (in silty clay or loamy sand) to mobile (in\r\nsilty clay loam) . For PBA and DCVA, a low pH suppressed ionization, thus\r\nincreasing adsorption and decreasing mobility in more acidic soils. Therefore,\r\nthese metabolites would be fairly mobile in neutral to alkaline soils</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Microbes play a significant role in the degradation of\r\ncypermethrin. Cypermethrin degrades more slowly under anaerobic and waterlogged\r\nconditions. The anaerobic half-life reported at &lt;14 days is similar to the\r\nhalf-life in aerobic soils ranging from 6-20 days \u00a0but the major\r\nmetabolite, PBA, does not continue to break down anaerobically . The chemical\r\nalso degrades more slowly in sterilized versus natural soils which illustrates\r\nthe importance of microorganisms (Chapman\u00a0<i>et al</i>., 1981). In sterile\r\naerobic soils, the half-life was 20 to 25 weeks .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin is relatively non-persistent in soils with the\r\ntypical half-life in sandy soils of 2-4 weeks. Increased cypermethrin\r\npersistence was observed in soil with high organic matter, high clay content,\r\nreduced microbial activity and anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The water solubility of\r\ncypermethrin is very low, 4 ppb at 200 C. Cypermethrin is extremely hydrophobic\r\nand will quickly move from an aqueous solution to suspended particulates .\r\nThus, relatively small amounts of suspended matter in natural bodies of water\r\nmay remove a significant amount of cypermethrin from the aqueous phase. Soils\r\nand sediment are the main environmental reservoirs for cypermethrin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin hydrolyses slowly in water at pH 7 and below, with\r\nhydrolysis being more rapid at pH 9. Under normal environmental temperatures\r\nand pH, cypermethrin is stable to hydrolysis with a half-life of &gt;50 days.\r\nIt is also stable to photolysis with a half-life of &gt;100 days. In sterile\r\nsolution in sunlight, cypermethrin photodegrades slowly, with &lt;10% lost in\r\n32 days . In darkness, cypermethrin was fairly stable with 88.7 and 95.6%\r\nrecovery after 10 days in river water and distilled water, respectively . Rapid\r\ndegradation occurred with a half-life of about 5 days in river water, which is\r\nthree to four times faster than degradation in distilled water. This suggests\r\nindirect photolysis involving naturally occurring substances that result in\r\nenhanced photodegradation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">When photodegradation of cypermethrin occurs, the major\r\nphotoproducts produced are DCVA and PBA, with the a small amount of\r\n3-phenoxybenzaldehyde as a minor photoproduct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The partition coefficient of cypermethrin is very high (Kow=3.98\r\nx106), consequently it binds strongly onto organic matter .Because of its\r\nstrong affinity for soil, cypermethrin may be carried away to nearby water\r\nbodies in suspended sediment by rain and irrigation. Yet, once the pesticide is\r\nadsorbed to soil particles, bioavailability is reduced, diminishing the\r\ntoxicological risk to aquatic animals . In pond experiments, fish have survived\r\nin pond water that contained apparently lethal concentrations of cypermethrin\r\n(5 ppb) because the chemical was sorbed onto suspended solids</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bird LD50: mallard duck &gt;4640 mg/kg</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bird LC50 (dietary): mallard duck, bobwhite quail &gt;20000 ppm</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 996 h): rainbow trout 0.0018 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia magna LC50: 0.0002 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin is practically non-toxic to birds, but is very highly\r\ntoxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates.

This action is especially critical to fish and aquatic insects where\r\nATPase enzymes provide the energy necessary to active transport, and are very\r\nimportant at sites of oxygen exchange. ATPase inhibition and disruption of\r\nactive transport, possibly affect ion movement and the ability to maintain ion\r\nbalance, and disrupt respiratory surfaces, indicating that cypermethrin is\r\ninherently more toxic to aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In vertebrates and invertebrates, cypermethrin acts mainly on the\r\nnervous system<b>.\u00a0</b>Cypermethrin is both a stomach poison and a contact\r\ninsecticide. In the peripheral nervous system of the frog<b>,\u00a0</b>its\r\nprimary action is to induce noticeably repetitive activity and produce trains\r\nof nerve impulses as a result of altering ion permeability of nerve membranes .\r\nThese long-lasting trains can cause hundreds to thousands of repetitive nerve\r\nimpulses in the sense organs. This repetitive activity is induced by pyrethroid\r\ndamage to the voltage-dependent sodium channel, causing sodium channels to stay\r\nopen much longer than normal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cypermethrin is highly toxic to bees</span></p> <p>Substances containing unsaturated carbons are ubiquitous in indoor environments.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Personal exposure levels during formulation of the technical concentrate of cypermethrin have been measured up to 54.1 mg/m3.

Synthetic pyrethroids are neuropoisons acting on the axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems by interacting with sodium channels in mammals and/or insects. A single dose produces toxic signs in mammals, such as tremors, hyperexcitability, salivation, choreoathetosis (a condition characterised by aimless muscle movements and involuntary motions), and paralysis. The signs disappear fairly rapidly, and the animals recover, generally within a week. At near-lethal dose levels, synthetic pyrethroids cause transient changes in the nervous system, such as axonal swelling and/or breaks and myelin degeneration in the sciatic nerves. They are not considered to cause delayed neurotoxicity of the kind induced by some organophosphorus compounds. Pyrethroids have at least two distinct actions- a short-term pharmacological effect at near-lethal dose levels and a more long-term neurotoxic effect that results in sparse axonal nerve damage.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>This synthetic pyrethroid produces Type II syndrome (or CS syndrome characteristic of those ester containing the alpha-cyano substituent) and, in rats, causes coarse tremors, clonic seizures , sinus writhing (choreoathetosis) and profuse salivation without lachrymation: hence the term CS (choreoathetosis/salivation) syndrome. The bulk of evidence indicates that Type II syndrome principally involves an action in the mammalian central nervous system. In poorly ventilated spaces, exposure may result in toxic effects in humans. Ingestion (associated with sloppy handling) of deltamethrin, fenvalerate and cypermethrin (all Type II compounds), amongst Chinese cotton crop workers, produced epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, anorexia, fatigue, tightness of the chest, blurred vision, paraesthesia, palpitations, course muscular fasciculations in large muscle extremities and disturbances of consciousness.</p> <p>\u00a0Severe poisonings produced convulsive attacks (lasting 30-120 seconds) accompanied by flexion of upper limbs, extension of lower limbs and loss of consciousness.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Single dermal applications of alpha-cypermethrin to mice and rats at 100 and 500 mg/kg body weight did not cause mortality or signs of intoxication</p> <p>Skin contact with natural pyrethrins may result in severe dermatitis and may also be associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Absorption through the skin may result in a toxic syndrome similar to that produced by inhalation. Systemic effects, following skin absorption, may include liver and kidney damage. Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause central nervous system effects and allergic skin reaction.</p> <p>One form of toxicity associated with alpha-substituted synthetic pyrethroids, is a cutaneous parasthaesia observed amongst workers involved in spraying the material. This develops several hours following exposure and produces a stinging or burning sensation on the skin progressing, in some cases, to tingling and numbness, effects lasting for 12-18 hours. Chinese cotton crop workers reported dizziness, burning, itching or tingling sensations of exposed skin which was exacerbated by sweating and washing with warm water. These symptoms disappeared by 24 hours after exposure. Spilling these agents on the head, face and eyes resulted in pain, lachrymation, photophobia, congestion and oedema of the conjunctiva and eyelids.</p> <p>[Cassaret &amp; Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisoning, 4th Ed]</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Exposure to cypermethrin may produce convulsions, loss of consciousness and possible death. Short-term exposure to rats of alpha-cypermethrin at concentrations up to 200 mg/kg diet for 5 weeks or up to 180 mg/kg diet per day for 13 weeks did not cause toxic effects. At higher doses rats exhibited signs of intoxication associated with pathology of the nervous system, decreased growth or increased liver and kidney weights. Alpha-cypermethrin induces neurotoxicity due to histopathological alterations of the tibial and sciatic nerves, axonal degeneration and increased beta-galactosidase activity.</p> <p>Short-term toxicity studies indicate that alpha-cypermethrin is approximately 2 to 3 times more toxic than cypermethrin in rats and dogs. Following oral administration to rats 90% of the dose was eliminated from the body over a 4-day period, 78% in the first day. residues in tissues were low except in fat tissue. In human volunteers 43% of an oral dose (0.25-0.75 mg) was excreted within 24 hours in the urine as free or conjugated cis-cyclopropane carboxylic acid.</p> <p>Ingestion of pyrethrins may produce nausea, vomiting, headache and other central nervous system disturbances. Excitation, muscular tremors and a period of shock may be followed by death. Dogs fed 5000 ppm of pyrethrum, for 90 days, developed dyspnae, tremors, ataxia and excessive salivation. An estimated fatal human dose is thought to be 100 gms. for a typical 70 kg man (1430 mg/kg).</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies with similar materials using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Long-term testing does not indicate any carcinogenic potential for cypermethrin.</p> <p>Chronic poisoning by natural pyrethrins may result in convulsion, tetanic paralysis, rapid and uneven heart beat, liver and kidney damage, or death.</p> <p>The natural pyrethrins may produce hypersensitivity, especially following previous sensitising exposure. In general, repeated exposures over 2 or 3 years are required to elicit a response and involve exposure to pyrethrum rather than its individual components (including pyrethrins). The sesquiterpene lactone (pyrethrosin) and the pyrethrum glycoproteins account for the immediate and delayed hypersensitivity seen in guinea pigs following a single injection of ground chrysanthemum in Freud's adjuvant. Mild erythematic vesicular dermatitis (with papules), pruritus, localized oedema (particularly of the face, lips and eyelids), rhinitis, tachycardia, pallor and sweating are the most common syndromes. An initial skin sensitisation can progress to marked dermal oedema and skin cracking. Pyrethrum dermatitis appears to increase in hot weather or under conditions were heavy perspiration is produced. The active ingredients of pyrethrum (except pyrethrin II) are inactive in patch tests. Those patients allergic to ragweed pollen are particularly sensitive to pyrethrin.</p> <p>Rats fed on a diet of pyrethrins for 5000 ppm for 2 years showed some signs of tissue damage including liver lesions, bile duct proliferation and focal necrosis of the liver cells. A no-effect level of 1000 ppm found in animal experiments correspond to a daily dose of 3600 mg/man.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p>",

Through modifications of both acid and alcohol portions of the ester, compounds of desired residual activity have been synthesised whilst maintaining a biodegradable ester linkage. These compounds are generally very toxic to crustaceans and fish in laboratory bio assays. Under field conditions, however, the residues are tightly bound in sediment, and ingested residues are readily metabolised. Their toxicity in natural systems are generally less than laboratory test data might indicate. They are generally non-persistent in the environment.\u00a0</p> <p>In pond waters and in laboratory degradation studies, pyrethroid concentrations decrease rapidly due to sorption to sediment, suspended particles and plants. Microbial and photodegradation also occur</p> <p>\u00a0Pyrethrins are generally unstable in the presence of light, are hydrolysed rapidly under alkaline conditions and oxidise rapidly in air. Vapour phase pyrethrins may combine chemically with ozone to produce hydroxy radicals. Pyrethroids where the isobutenyl group attached to the cyclopropane moiety has been altered are more stable to sunlight than the early pyrethroids like allethrin or resmethrin. For this reason, pyrethroids such as permethrin, deltamethrin, cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, and cypermethrin are more frequently applied outdoors to crops in comparison to the rapidly degraded pyrethroids like resmethrin and allethrin.</p> <p>Because agricultural dose rates are low and biological degradation is generally rapid, residues are unlikely to attain significant levels. Permethrin disappears from ponds and streams within 6-24 hours, pond sediments within 7 days and foliage and forest soil within 58 days. Since pyrethrins and pyrethroids undergo photolysis in the atmosphere, they are also degraded by this mechanism in sunlit surface waters. Photosensitising agents found in natural waters such as fulvic and humic acids increase the rate of photolysis.\u00a0Pyrethroids and pyrethrins also undergo hydrolysis in the environment at varying rates depending upon pH and temperature. Generally, hydrolysis is only an important environmental fate process under alkaline conditions and at temperatures of 20 deg. C or greater.</p> <p>Based on the vapor pressure of the pyrethrins and pyrethroids, these compounds are expected to exist in both vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor phase pyrethrins and pyrethroids are rapidly degraded in the atmosphere by direct photolysis and reaction with oxidants found in air such as photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrate radicals. Particulate phase compounds are slower to degrade, however, and can travel long distances before being removed from the air by wet and dry deposition.</p> <p>Pyrethrins and pyrethroids are strongly adsorbed to soil surfaces and are not considered very mobile. A wide range of Koc values has been reported by different authors, but most of these values indicate a high degree of adsorption and little leaching potential. Since light is attenuated as a function of depth from the soil surface, photolysis of pyrethrins and pyrethroids is only an important environmental fate process at the surface of the soil. The potential for significant toxicity is not reached in fields. Under aerobic conditions in soil, permethrin degrades in a relatively short time (half-life 28 days).</p> <p>Volatilisation from water and soil is expected to occur slowly for many of the pyrethroids since these compounds generally have low vapor pressures and Henry's law constants. When released to water, partitioning to suspended solids and sediment occurs rapidly. These compounds adsorb strongly to suspended solids and sediment in the water column, and this process significantly attenuates volatilisation. Volatilisation losses from foliage may be considerably greater than volatilisation from soils because pyrethrins and pyrethroids do not adsorb as strongly to the leafy component of vegetation as to soils. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids are often used indoors in sprays or aerosol bombs, and the volatilisation rates from glass or floor surfaces may be significantly faster than from soils since these compounds are not likely to adsorb as strongly to these surfaces.</p> <p>Little data exist regarding the uptake and transport of pyrethrins and pyrethroids by plant material. Since many of these compounds are rapidly degraded in the environment, this transport mechanism may not be an important environmental fate process other than the initial settling of these compounds on the canopy following deposition. The aerial surface of a plant, including foliage, is covered by a cuticle, which serves as a barrier to water loss and to prevent penetration of applied chemicals or environmental pollutants. Once deposited on the surface, a chemical may be degraded, bind to the cuticle, or diffuse into the plant through the stomata. Since pyrethrins and pyrethroids adsorb strongly to soils, their uptake from roots and transport within plants is expected to be limited.\u00a0</p> <p>The general population is exposed to pyrethrins and pyrethroids primarily from food sources, especially fruits and vegetables.\u00a0The tendency of young children to ingest soil, either intentionally through pica or unintentionally through hand-to-mouth activity, is well documented. These behavioral traits can result in ingestion of pyrethrins and pyrethroids present in soil and dust. Since these compounds are adsorbed strongly to soils, they may not be in a highly bioavailable form. Young children often play on the ground or on carpets and this will increase the likelihood of dermal exposure and inhalation of contaminated particles from soil, household dust and treated surfaces.</p> <p>Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>pesticide 0.1 ug/l (UK max.)</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Synthetic pyrethroids are extremely effective against insects, but are relatively safe to mammals and birds. One potential problem of pyrethroids is their extreme toxicity to aquatic organisms, where often &lt;1 ug/L will produce toxic effects.</p> <p>The half-lives for elimination of several pyrethroids by trout are all greater than 48 hours, while elimination half-lives in birds and mammals range from 6 to 12 hours</p> <p>Pyrethroids are highly toxic to fish; with 96-hour LC50 values generally below 10 ug/l. Corresponding LD50 values in mammals and birds are in the range of several hundred to several thousand mg/kg. Fish sensitivity to the pyrethroids may be explained by their relatively slow metabolism and elimination of these compounds.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>The material is not thought to produce respiratory irritation (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless inhalation of vapours, fumes or aerosols, especially for prolonged periods, may produce respiratory discomfort and occasionally, distress.</p> <p>Inhalation of pyrethrins may produce nausea, vomiting, sneezing, serious nasal discharge, nasal stuffiness and asthma. High concentrations may produce hyperexcitability, incoordination, tremors, muscular paralysis and death (due to respiratory failure).</p> <p>There have been some reports of transient facial tingling (paraesthesia) which lasts a few hours after exposure.</p> <p>In common with natural pyrethrins, the material may produce central nervous system stimulation with nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity, incoordination, tremors, muscle paralysis, convulsion, coma, and respiratory failure. Synthetic pyrethroids are neuropoisons acting on the axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems by interacting with sodium channels in mammals and/or insects. A single dose produces toxic signs in mammals, such as tremors, hyperexcitability, salivation, choreoathetosis (a condition characterised by aimless muscle movements and involuntary motions), and paralysis. The signs disappear fairly rapidly, and the animals recover, generally within a week. At near-lethal dose levels, synthetic pyrethroids cause transient changes in the nervous system, such as axonal swelling and/or breaks and myelin degeneration in the sciatic nerves. They are not considered to cause delayed neurotoxicity of the kind induced by some organophosphorus compounds. Pyrethroids have at least two distinct actions- a short-term pharmacological effect at near-lethal dose levels and a more long-term neurotoxic effect that results in sparse axonal nerve damage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0This synthetic pyrethroid produces Type I poisoning syndrome (or \"T\" syndrome which is characteristic of those esters lacking an alpha-cyano substituent) and, in rats, causes such signs as sparring and aggressive behaviour, enhanced startle response, whole body tremor and prostration. Evidence indicates that Type I syndrome involves peripheral nerves in the mammal. Although this insecticide cannot be considered highly toxic in mammals its use indoors, in enclosed and poorly ventilated spaces may result in toxic effects in humans. Although natural pyrethroid produces allergic responses (rather than direct neurotoxicity) there is little evidence of allergic-type responses amongst humans exposed to the synthetic pyrethroid esters.</p> <p>[Cassaret &amp; Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisoning, 4th Ed.]</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p>|A 4-week inhalation study exposed rats to 2.4, 22.0 or 186 mg/m3 of imiprothrin with a median aerodynamic diameter of 0.8 to 0.86 um.

Absorption through the skin may result in a toxic syndrome similar to that produced by inhalation. Systemic effects, following skin absorption, may include liver and kidney damage.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Ingestion of pyrethrins may produce nausea, vomiting, headache and other central nervous system disturbances.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies with similar materials using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Chronic poisoning by natural pyrethrins may result in convulsion, tetanic paralysis, rapid and uneven heart beat, liver and kidney damage, or death.</p> <p>The natural pyrethrins may produce hypersensitivity, especially following previous sensitising exposure. In general, repeated exposures over 2 or 3 years are required to elicit a response and involve exposure to pyrethrum rather than its individual components (including pyrethrins). The sesquiterpene lactone (pyrethrosin) and the pyrethrum glycoproteins account for the immediate and delayed hypersensitivity seen in guinea pigs following a single injection of ground chrysanthemum in Freud's adjuvant. Mild erythematic vesicular dermatitis (with papules), pruritus, localized oedema (particularly of the face, lips and eyelids), rhinitis, tachycardia, pallor and sweating are the most common syndromes. An initial skin sensitisation can progress to marked dermal oedema and skin cracking. Pyrethrum dermatitis appears to increase in hot weather or under conditions were heavy perspiration is produced. The active ingredients of pyrethrum (except pyrethrin II) are inactive in patch tests. Those patients allergic to ragweed pollen are particularly sensitive to pyrethrin.</p> <p>Rats fed on a diet of pyrethrins for 5000 ppm for 2 years showed some signs of tissue damage including liver lesions, bile duct proliferation and focal necrosis of the liver cells. A no-effect level of 1000 ppm found in animal experiments correspond to a daily dose of 3600 mg/man.</p>|Based on the results of a developmental study in rabbits, imiprothin is not a developmental toxicant at dose levels which did not also produce maternal toxicity.|Rats were fed imiprothrin at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg body weight/ day. The maternal NOEL was 30 mg/kg/body weight based on suppressed body weight gain and food consumption, while the LOEL was 100 mg/kg body weight/ day.|At 300 mg/kg body weight/ day, premature labour, abortion, and mortality were noted. The developmental NOEL was not determined (i.e it is less than 100 mg/kg body weight/ day), on the basis of decreased foetal body weight and frontal bone hypoplasia. An increased incidence of the 27th pre-sacral vertebra occurred in all treatment groups. The LOEL was not determined.|An additional developmental study was conducted on rabbits at doses of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg body weight/ day to determine the developmental end points which the earlier study was not able to define. This study showed no treatment related developmental effects. the developmental NOEL, based on both studies was 30 mg/kg/day while the LOEL was 100 mg/kg/ body weight/ day.|When subjected to the Ames test with Salmonella and with E. coli, imiprothin was not mutagenic. An in vitro gene mutation assay with Chinese hamster cells showed that this chemical does not have the potential to cause gene mutations. An in vitro chromosome aberration showed that imiprothrin did have the potential to cause chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster lung cells in the presence of S9 metabolic activation. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test did not show chromosome damage. Two in vivo/ in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis test were conducted with primary rat hepatocytes; time course and dose response.|Neither UDS test showed an increase in such synthesis. Th weight of evidence indicates that imiprothrin is not genotoxic.",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Insoluble in water (0.6 mg/l),  freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, toluene and most other hydrocarbon solvents.|Antioxidant properties of BHT rely on its molecular configuration, because, like other synthetic phenolic antioxidants, it possesses a labile hydrogen atom in the hydroxy group that can be donated and reduce the free radicals generated at the initiation step of lipid oxidation. Thus, BHT itself is oxidized and the subsequent derived radical is stabilized by electronic delocalization in the benzene ring. This way, BHT can stop radical oxidation propagation, which retards lipid oxidation and extends food shelf-life. Several authors reported rapid loss of BHT at high temperatures (>140 C) and noticed lower antioxidant activity. This fact was attributed not only to the compound volatilization, but also to its transformation into metabolites.|BHT is included in the category of \"bridged alkyl phenols\"  for data purposes because it is an alkyl|phenol with a single carbon group such as the ones that link the phenol groups.",

Degradation of APEs in wastewater\r\ntreatment plants or in the environment generates more persistent shorter-chain\r\nAPEs and alkylphenols (APs) such as nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and AP\r\nmono- to triethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2 and NPE3). There is concern that APE\r\nmetabolites (NP, OP, NPE1-3) can mimic natural hormones and that the levels\r\npresent in the environment may be sufficient to disrupt endocrine function in\r\nwildlife and humans. The physicochemical properties of the APE metabolites (NP,\r\nNPE1-4, OP, OPE1-4), in particular the high Kow values, indicate that they will\r\npartition effectively into sediments following discharge from STPs. The aqueous\r\nsolubility data for the APE metabolites indicate that the concentration in\r\nwater combined with the high partition coefficients will provide a significant\r\nreservoir (load) in various environmental compartments. Data from studies\r\nconducted in many regions across the world have shown significant levels in\r\nsamples of every environmental compartment examined. In the US, levels of NP in\r\nair ranged from 0.01 to 81 ng/m3, with seasonal trends observed. Concentrations\r\nof APE metabolites in treated wastewater effluents in the US ranged from &lt;\r\n0.1 to 369 ug/l, in Spain they were between 6 and 343 ug/l and concentrations\r\nup to 330 ug/l were found in the UK. Levels in sediments reflected the high\r\npartition coefficients with concentrations reported ranging from &lt; 0.1 to\r\n13,700 ug/kg for sediments in the US. Fish in the UK were found to contain up\r\nto 0.8 ug/kg NP in muscle tissue. APEs degraded faster in the water column than\r\nin sediment. Aerobic conditions facilitate easier further biotransformation of\r\nAPE metabolites than anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenols are susceptible to photochemical degradation. Using\r\nnatural, filtered, lake water it was found that nonylphenol had a half-life of\r\napproximately 10-15 h under continuous, noon, summer sun in the surface water\r\nlayer, with a rate approximately 1.5 times slower at depths 20-25 cm.\r\nPhotolysis was much slower with ethoxylated nonylphenol, and so it is unlikely\r\nto be a significant event in removal of the ethoxylates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols released to the\r\natmosphere will exist in the vapour phase and is thought to be degraded by\r\nreaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, with a calculated\r\nhalf-life, for nonylphenol, of 0.3 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Abiotic degradation of\r\nalkylphenol is negligible.

During\r\ndegradation ethylene oxide units are cleaved off the ethylene oxide chain until\r\nonly short-chain alkylphenol ethoxylates remain, typically mono- and diethylene\r\noxides. Oxidation of these oligomers creates the corresponding carboxylic acids.\r\nThis leaves several degradation products: short-chain ethoxylates, their\r\ncarboxylic acids, and alkylphenols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Alkylphenols are not\r\nreadily biodegradable. Several mechanisms of microbial aromatic ring\r\ndegradation have been reported, the most common being formation of catechol\r\nfrom phenol, followed by ring scission between or adjacent to the two hydroxyl\r\ngroups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The full breakdown pathway for APES has not yet been determined,\r\nand all studies have so far focused on identification of intermediates in\r\nbacterial culture media, rather than studying cell-free systems or purified\r\nenzymes. It is, however, likely that microbial metabolism usually starts by an\r\nattack on the ethoxylate chain, rather than on the ring or the hydrophobic\r\nchain. The ethoxylate groups are progressively removed, either by ether\r\ncleavage, or by terminal alcohol oxidation followed by cleavage of the\r\nresulting carboxylic acid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation of APEs produces less biodegradable products:\r\nalkylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylates, alkylphenoxy acetic and\r\nalkylphenoxypolyethoxy acetic acids, and alkylphenols. These metabolites\r\nfrequently persist through sewage treatment and in rivers. Anaerobic conditions\r\ngenerally lead to the accumulation of alkylphenols. The rate of biodegradation\r\nseems to decrease with increasing length of the ethylene oxide chain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Metabolites of APES\r\naccumulate in organisms, with bioconcentration factors varying from ten to\r\nseveral thousand, depending on species, metabolite and organ.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The metabolites of APES are generally more toxic than the original\r\ncompounds. APES have LC50s above about 1.5 mg/l, whereas alkylphenols,such as\r\nnonylphenol, have LC50s are generally around 0.1 mg/l.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Oestrogenic activity:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The role\r\nof alkyl chain length and branching, substituent position, number of alkylated\r\ngroups, and the requirement of a phenolic ring structure was assessed in fish.\r\nThe results showed that most alkylphenols were oestrogenic, although with 3-300\r\nthousand times lower potency than the endogenous estrogen 17beta-estradiol.\r\nMono-substituted tertiary alkylphenols with moderate (C4-C5) and long alkyl\r\nchain length (C8-C9) in the para position exhibited the highest oestrogenic\r\npotency. Substitution with multiple alkyl groups, presence of substituents in\r\nthe ortho- and meta-position and lack of a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring\r\nreduced the oestrogenic activity, although several oestrogenic alkylated\r\nnon-phenolics were identified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Human exposure:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Alkylphenols were first\r\nfound to be oestrogenic (oestrogen-mimicking) in the 1930s, but more recent\r\nresearch has highlighted the implications of these effects. The growth of\r\ncultured human breast cancer cells is affected by nonylphenol at concentrations\r\nas low as 1 uM (220 ug/ l) or concentrations of octylphenol as low as 0.1 uM\r\n(20 ug/1). Oestrogenic effects have also been shown on rainbow trout\r\nhepatocytes, chicken embryo fibroblasts and a mouse oestrogen receptor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The insecticide chlordecone (Kepone) shows similar behaviour to\r\nalkylphenols, accumulating in liver and adipose tissue, and eliciting\r\noestrogenic activity. Workers exposed to this insecticide can suffer\r\nreproductive effects such as low sperm counts and sterility. In addition, the\r\noestrogenic effects of chlordecone on MCF7 cells occur at similar concentrations\r\nto those of alkylphenols, suggesting that alkylphenols will be a similar health\r\nhazard if target cells are exposed to uM levels of these compounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">By comparing environmental concentrations, bioconcentration\r\nfactors and\u00a0<i>in vitro\u00a0</i>oestrogenic effect levels, current\r\nenvironmental levels of alkylphenolic compounds are probably high enough to\r\naffect the hormonal control systems of some organisms.

Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>Metal-containing inorganic substances generally have negligible vapour pressure and are not expected to partition to air. Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">For silica amorphous:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amorphous silica is chemically and biologically inert. It is not\r\nbiodegradable. Due to its insolubility in water there is a separation at every\r\nfiltration and sedimentation process.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Crystalline and/or amorphous silicas are ubiquitous on the earth\r\nin soils and sediments, and in living organisms (e.g. diatoms), but only the\r\ndissolved form is bioavailable. On a global scale, the level of man-made\r\nsynthetic amorphous silicas (SAS) represents up to 2.4% of the dissolved silica\r\nnaturally present in the aquatic environment. The rate of SAS released into the\r\nenvironment during the product life cycle is negligible in comparison with the\r\nnatural flux of silica in the environment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Untreated SASs have a relatively low water solubility of 1.91 to\r\n2.51 mmol/l (114 - 151 mg/l) and an extremely low vapour pressure (e.g. &lt;\r\n10\u20133 Pa at 20\u00b0 C for Aerosil R972). On the basis of these properties it is\r\nexpected that SAS released into the environment will be distributed mainly into\r\nsoil/sediment, slightly into water, and probably not at all into air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With surface-treated SASs, the addition of organosilicon compounds\r\nincreases the hydrophobicity. Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low. Due to the\r\npresence of organic substances such as surfactants, salts, acids and alkalis in\r\nthe environment, it is expected that surface-treated silica will be wetted and\r\nthen adsorbed onto soils or sediments</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SAS is regarded as an inert substance and is not expected to\r\nundergo any transformation in the atmospheric or terrestrial compartment, apart\r\nfrom dissolution by water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradability in sewage treatment plant or in surface water is\r\nnot applicable to inorganic substances like SAS. Therefore the biodegradation\r\nendpoint has limited relevance for SAS. In surface modified SASs, the most\r\ncommon treating agents are organosilicon compounds and these generally\r\nrepresent less than 5% of the material. Biodegradation in sewage treatment\r\nplant or in surface water is not expected. Some biodegradation in soil may\r\noccur by analogy with the behaviour of linear polydimethylsiloxane in this\r\ncompartment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on available data, SAS is not toxic to environmental\r\norganisms (apart from physical desiccation in insects).

No mortality was\r\nobserved for the fish after 96 hours of exposure at 1,000 mg/l and 10,000 mg/l.\r\nThe test media remained turbid throughout the test, indicating that the limit\r\nof solubility of the product was exceeded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With the water flea (<i>Daphnia magna</i>), SAS suspensions\r\nexceeding the limit of solubility were tested.; some immobilisation was\r\nobserved. \u00a0However, no significant immobilisation was observed when a\r\nsolution filtered through microfibre glass filter was tested. The observed\r\neffects were likely caused by physical hampering of the\u00a0<i>Daphnia\u00a0</i>due\r\nto the presence of undissolved particles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A surface-treated SAS (Aerosil R974; 99.9% pure) was tested on\r\nfish and crustaceans.

This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>The synthetic, amorphous silicas are believed to represent a very greatly reduced silicosis hazard compared to crystalline silicas and are considered to be nuisance dusts.</p> <p>When heated to high temperature and a long time, amorphous silica can produce crystalline silica on cooling. Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For isobutane:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Refrigerant Gas: Saturated Hydrocarbons have zero ozone depletion\r\npotential (ODP) and will photodegrade under atmospheric conditions.\r\n&nbsp;[Calor Gas]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental Fate</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Terrestrial fate:&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>&nbsp;An\r\nestimated Koc value of 35 suggests that isobutane will have very high mobility\r\nin soil.

Volatilisation of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07x10-1 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg, and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L. Propane is expected to volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using cell suspensions of microorganisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidised to acetone within 24 hours, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>The estimated Koc value indicates that propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law constant volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are estimated to be 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively. \u00a0An estimated BCF of 13.1 using log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. After 192 hr, the trace concentration of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate</b>:: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour pressure, propane is expected to exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>No health effects were seen in humans exposed at 1,000 ppm isobutane for up to 8 hours or 500 ppm for 8 hours/day for 10 days.

Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic.

Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
