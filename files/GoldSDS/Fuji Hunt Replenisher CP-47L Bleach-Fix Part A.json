The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce toxic effects.</p> <p>The highly irritant properties of ammonia vapour result as the gas dissolves in mucous fluids and forms irritant, even corrosive solutions.</p> <p>Inhalation of the ammonia fumes causes coughing, vomiting, reddening of lips, mouth, nose, throat and conjunctiva while higher concentrations can cause temporary blindness, restlessness, tightness in the chest, pulmonary oedema (lung damage), weak pulse and cyanosis.</p> <p>Inhalation of high concentrations of vapour may cause breathing difficulty, tightness in chest, pulmonary oedema and lung damage. Brief exposure to high concentrations &gt; 5000 ppm may cause death due to asphyxiation (suffocation) or fluid in the lungs.</p> <p>Prolonged or regular minor exposure to the vapour may cause persistent irritation of the eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract. Massive ammonia exposures may produce chronic airway hyperactivity and asthma with associated pulmonary function changes. The average nasal retention of ammonia by human subjects was found to be 83%.</p> <p>If exposure to highly concentrated vapour atmosphere is prolonged this may lead to narcosis, unconsciousness, even coma and unless resuscitated - death.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Mild irritation is produced on moist skin when vapour concentrations of ammonia exceed 10000 ppm. High vapour concentrations (&gt;30000 ppm) or direct contact with solutions produces severe pain, a stinging sensation, burns and vesiculation and possible brown stains.

Very large doses of ammonium salts may produce a drop in blood pressure, collapse, central nervous system disorders, spasms, narcosis, respiratory paralysis and haemolysis.</p> <p>Large doses of ammonium salts may be sufficiently absorbed to produce diuresis and systemic ammonia poisoning. Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p>",

Repeated exposure or prolonged contact may produce dermatitis, and conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Other effects may include ulcerative changes to the mouth and bronchial and gastrointestinal disturbances. Adaptation to usually irritating concentrations may result in tolerance. In animals, repeated exposures to sub-lethal levels produces adverse effects on the respiratory tract, liver, kidneys and spleen.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>metal oxides</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Sequestering agents are occasionally used in therapies for various forms of poisoning and are normally injected intravenously. A systemic reaction known as the \"excessive chelation syndrome\" consists mainly of malaise, fatigue, thirst and parathesias, followed by chills and fever. Myalgia, headache, anorexia, nausea and occasionally marked urinary frequency and urgency may also occur. Minor reactions resembling those produced by histamine or the common cold are sometimes seen.</p> <p>Parenteral administration of EDTA and its salts in high doses may produce severe renal lesions with tubular necrosis, internal haemorrhage, transient bone marrow depression and life-threatening hypocalcaemia. Prolonged parenteral exposures produce electrolyte imbalance and possible cardiac arrhythmias.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may result in irritation. EDTA and its metal salts do not permeate the cellular membrane to a significant extent; they remain in the extracellular fluid until excreted. \u00a0(ILO Encyclopaedia)</p> <p>NOTE: Conflicting animal test data is available with regard to the teratogenic potential of EDTA sodium salts. \u00a0Some data indicate that teratogenic effects may occur at extremely high maternal doses.</p> <p>Chronic excessive iron exposure has been associated with haemosiderosis and consequent possible damage to the liver and pancreas. Haemosiderin is a golden-brown insoluble protein produced by phagocytic digestion of haematin (an iron-based pigment). Haemosiderin is found in most tissues, especially in the liver, in the form of granules. Other sites of haemosiderin deposition include the pancreas and skin. A related condition, haemochromatosis, which involves a disorder of metabolism of these deposits, may produce cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, and bronze pigmentation of the skin - heart failure may eventually occur.</p> <p>\u00a0Such exposure may also produce conjunctivitis, choroiditis, retinitis (both inflammatory conditions involving the eye) and siderosis of tissues if iron remains in these tissues. Siderosis is a form of pneumoconiosis produced by iron dusts. Siderosis also includes discoloration of organs, excess circulating iron and degeneration of the retina, lens and uvea as a result of the deposition of intraocular iron. Siderosis might also involve the lungs - involvement rarely develops before ten years of regular exposure. Often there is an accompanying inflammatory reaction of the bronchi. Permanent scarring of the lungs does not normally occur.</p> <p>\u00a0High levels of iron may raise the risk of cancer. This concern stems from the theory that iron causes oxidative damage to tissues and organs by generating highly reactive chemicals, called free radicals, which subsequently react with DNA. Cells may be disrupted and may be become cancerous. People whose genetic disposition prevents them from keeping tight control over iron (e.g. those with the inherited disorder, haemochromatosis) may be at increased risk.</p> <p>Iron overload in men may lead to diabetes, arthritis, liver cancer, heart irregularities and problems with other organs as iron builds up.</p> <p>\u00a0[K.
