In addition, lesions have been observed in the\r\nliver, pancreas, and kidneys of animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental toxicity of zinc in water is dependent upon the\r\nconcentration of other minerals and the pH of the solution, which affect the\r\nligands that associate with zinc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Zinc occurs in the environment mainly in the +2 oxidation state.\r\nSorption is the dominant reaction, resulting in the enrichment of zinc in suspended\r\nand bed sediments. Zinc in aerobic waters is partitioned into sediments through\r\nsorption onto hydrous iron and manganese oxides, clay minerals, and organic\r\nmaterial. The efficiency of these materials in removing zinc from solution\r\nvaries according to their concentrations, pH, redox potential (Eh), salinity,\r\nnature and concentrations of complexing ligands, cation exchange capacity, and\r\nthe concentration of zinc. Precipitation of soluble zinc compounds appears to\r\nbe significant only under reducing conditions in highly polluted water.\r\nGenerally, at lower pH values, zinc remains as the free ion.

In a study of the effect of pH on zinc solubility: When the pH is\r\n&lt;7, an inverse relationship exists between the pH and the amount of zinc in\r\nsolution. As negative charges on soil surfaces increase with increasing pH,\r\nadditional sites for zinc adsorption are activated and the amount of zinc in\r\nsolution decreases. The active zinc species in the adsorbed state is the singly\r\ncharged zinc hydroxide species (i.e., Zn[OH]+). Other investigators have also\r\nshown that the mobility of zinc in soil increases at lower soil pH under\r\noxidizing conditions and at a lower cation exchange capacity of soil. On the\r\nother hand, the amount of zinc in solution generally increases when the pH is\r\n&gt;7 in soils high in organic matter. This is a result of the release of\r\norganically complexed zinc, reduced zinc adsorption at higher pH, or an\r\nincrease in the concentration of chelating agents in soil. For calcareous\r\nsoils, the relationship between zinc solubility and pH is nonlinear. At a high\r\npH, zinc in solution is precipitated as Zn(OH)2, zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), or\r\ncalcium zincate. Clay and metal oxides are capable of sorbing zinc and tend to\r\nretard its mobility in soil.

There are few data regarding the speciation of zinc released to the\r\natmosphere.

This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p><p>Soluble zinc salts produces irritation and corrosion of the alimentary tract (in a manner similar to copper salts) with pain, vomiting, etc. Delayed deaths have been ascribed to inanition (weakness and extreme weight loss resulting from prolonged and severe food insufficiency) following severe strictures of the oesophagus, and pylorus. Vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, in several cases with blood, have been observed after ingestion of zinc sulfate.</p> <p>Several cases of gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported after ingestion of zinc sulfate. A significant reduction in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (47% decrease), hematocrit, and serum ferritin, compared to pretreatment levels, occurred in female subjects who received supplements (as capsules) of 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 10 weeks. A 15% decrease in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was reported in male volunteers receiving 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 6 weeks. Another study reported increases in bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels (~25%) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (~15%), while significant decreases were seen in mononuclear white cell 5'-nucleotidase (~30%) and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activity (~36%) following exposure of postmenopausal women to a combined (dietary+supplemental) 53 mg zinc/day as zinc glycine chelate. Healthy men given 200 mg zinc/day as elemental zinc for 6 weeks showed a reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response to phytohemagglutinin as well as chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.; however, no changes in lymphocyte cell number or in the proportion of lymphocyte populations were noted. Exposure of male volunteers to 0.48 mg zinc/kg/day, as zinc glycine chelate, had no effect on markers of coagulation relative to unexposed subjects. While the changes in</p> <p>hematological end points following long-term zinc exposure in humans are noteworthy, they were subclinical in nature, and therefore, are generally considered to be non-adverse. In animals, following oral administration of zinc compounds, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte, and/or leukocyte levels were observed in rats, mice, rabbits , dogs, ferrets, and preruminant calves A number of intermediate-duration studies have demonstrated renal effects in animals exposed to zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc acetate. Zinc sulfate caused an increase in the absolute and relative kidney weights and regressive kidney lesions (not specified) in female mice that consumed 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day in the diet for 13 weeks, but no effects occurred in rats that consumed 565 mg zinc/kg/day or in mice that consumed 104 mg zinc/kg/day under similar conditions. Severe diffuse nephrosis was</p> <p>observed in ferrets exposed to 195 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet . In rats exposed to 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 3 months, epithelial cell damage in the glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubules and increased plasma creatinine and urea levels were observed. Zinc plays a role in the normal development and maintenance of the immune system, such as in the lymphocyte response to mitogens and as a cofactor for the thymic hormone thymulin. Oral exposure to zinc at levels much higher than the recommended daily dose has impaired immune and inflammatory responses. This was observed in in vivo investigations of the immune competence of blood components taken from 11 healthy adult men after ingestion of 4.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 6 weeks. The mitogenic response elicited from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the chemotactic and phagocytic responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were impaired after zinc ingestion. No effects were seen on total numbers of lymphocytes or relative numbers of T cells, T cell subsets, or B cells. The relationship between these observations and decreased levels of immune competence that might lead to increased susceptibility to disease is unknown. A later study reported no effects of supplementation of male volunteers with 30 mg zinc/day (0.43 mg zinc/kg/day assuming a reference male body weight of 70 kg) as zinc glycine chelate for 14 weeks on levels of peripheral blood leucocytes or on the frequency of lymphocyte subsets.</p> <p>Zinc appears to be necessary for normal brain function, but excess zinc is toxic. A 16-year-old boy who ingested .86 mg zinc/kg/day of metallic zinc over a 2-day period in an attempt to promote wound healing, developed signs and symptoms of lethargy, light-headedness, staggering, and difficulty in writing clearly . Lethargy was also observed in a 2-year-old child who ingested a zinc chloride solution (.1,000 mg zinc/kg). It is not known whether these observations represent direct effects on the nervous system. Very limited data were located regarding neurological effects in animals. Minor neuron degeneration and proliferation of oligodendroglia occurred in rats dosed with 487 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 10 days. Rats receiving 472 mg zinc/kg/day for 10 days had increased levels of secretory material in the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus. Mice exposed postnatally to 0.5 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 28 days showed no changes in memory formation, but showed a gradual decrease in learning extinction throughout the study.</p>",

Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents.

The risk\r\nis greatest when there is sufficient molten metal to entrap or seal off water.\r\nWater and other forms of contamination on or contained in scrap or remelt ingot\r\nare known to have caused explosions in melting operations. While the products\r\nmay have minimal surface roughness and internal voids, there remains the\r\npossibility of moisture contamination or entrapment.

First, through cation\r\nexchange reactions, manganese ions and the charged surface of soil particles\r\nform manganese oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides which in turn form\r\nabsorption sites for other metals. Secondly, manganese can be adsorbed to other\r\noxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides through ligand exchange reactions. When\r\nthe soil solution becomes saturated, these manganese oxides, hydroxides, and\r\noxyhydroxides can precipitate into a new mineral phase and act as a new surface\r\nto which other substances can absorb. &nbsp;The tendency of soluble manganese\r\ncompounds to adsorb to soils and sediments depends mainly on the cation\r\nexchange capacity and the organic composition of the soil. The soil adsorption\r\nconstants (the ratio of the concentration in soil to the concentration in\r\nwater) for Mn(II) span five orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.2 to 10,000\r\nmL/g, increasing as a function of the organic content and the ion exchange\r\ncapacity of the soil; thus, adsorption may be highly variable. In some cases,\r\nadsorption of manganese to soils may not be a readily reversible process. At\r\nlow concentrations, manganese may be &quot;fixed&quot; by clays and will not be\r\nreleased into solution readily. At higher concentrations, manganese may be\r\ndesorbed by ion exchange mechanisms with other ions in solution. For example,\r\nthe discharge of waste water effluent into estuarine environments resulted in\r\nthe mobilization of manganese from the bottom sediments. The metals in the\r\neffluent may have been preferentially adsorbed resulting in the release of\r\nmanganese. The oxidation state of manganese in soil and sediments may be\r\naltered by microbial activity; oxidation may lead to the precipitation of\r\nmanganese. Bacteria and microflora can increase the mobility of manganese.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The transport and partitioning of manganese in water is controlled\r\nby the solubility of the specific chemical form present, which in turn is\r\ndetermined by pH, Eh (oxidation-reduction potential), and the characteristics\r\nof the available anions.

The principal anion associated with Mn(II) in\r\nwater is usually carbonate (CO3.2), and the concentration of manganese is\r\nlimited by the relatively low solubility (65 mg/L) of MnCO3. In relatively\r\noxidized water, the solubility of Mn(II) may be controlled by manganese oxide\r\nequilibria, with manganese being converted to the Mn(II) or Mn(IV) oxidation\r\nstates. In extremely reduced water, the fate of manganese tends to be\r\ncontrolled by formation of a poorly soluble sulfide. Manganese in water may\r\nundergo oxidation at high pH or Eh and is also subject to microbial activity.\r\nFor example, Mn(II) in a lake was oxidized during the summer months, but this\r\nwas inhibited by a microbial poison, indicating that the oxidation was mediated\r\nby bacteria .

Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

                "Environment": "<p>Metal-containing inorganic substances generally have negligible vapour pressure and are not expected to partition to air. Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>|The primary route of entry is via inhalation of dust or fume.

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Later signs may include cloudy urine, conjunctivitis, decreased sex drive, calcium deposits in tissue, high fever, high blood pressure, increased sensitivity of eyes to light or eye irritation, runny nose, confusion, and weight loss<br />Prolonged administration of 2.5-3.75 mg ergocalciferol daily in adults or 1 mg or more in children is liable to give rise to toxic symptoms. Repeated ingestion of Vitamin D may produce elevated blood levels of calcium (hypercalcaemia). Early symptoms include weakness, nervousness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea or constipation, abdominal pain and cramping, dry mouth, polydypsia, metallic taste, paraesthesia, muscle and bone pain and pruritus. Late symptoms include rhinorrhea, hyperthermia, decreased libido, polyuria, nocturia, hypercalciuria, proteinuria and decreased renal function. Other effects include hyperphosphataemia, hypercholesterolaemia, anaemia, elevated non-protein nitrogen, acidosis and hypertension. Metastatic calcification may occur in the heart, blood vessels including the aorta, skin and other soft tissue. Calcium may deposit in the cornea and conjunctiva.<br />On rare occasions, strabismus, epicanthal folds, papilloedema, photophobia, slow pupillary response to light, iritis and cataracts may occur. Kidney calcification may produce nephrolithiosis, diffuse nephrocalcinosis and possible renal failure and death. Demineralisation of the bones and periarterial calcification may also result. Asthma, pancreatitis, parathyroid hyperplasia, cardiac arrhythmias and overt psychosis (rarely) may occur. Excessive doses of Vitamin D during pregnancy may produce retardation, congenital heart failure and suppression of thyroid function with hypocalcaemia, tetany and seizure in children.</p> <p>Primary hyperparathyroidism and renal impairment may be complicating factors associated with hypercalcaemia (elevated blood-borne levels of calcium)</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis have occurred only in premature infants with low birthweight. A syndrome of ascites, hepatomegaly, and thrombocytopenia resulting in death occurred in the 1980s in association with an intravenous vitamin E preparation used in premature infants with low birthweight. Presumably, the cause was a polysorbate carrier of the vitamin, and the syndrome has not occurred since its removal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased risk of sepsis occurred in one clinical trial (14% vs 6%) of premature neonates with a birth weight less than 1500 g to whom vitamin E was administered. When high-dose vitamin E of up to 30 mg/kg/d was administered to this population to prevent retrolental fibroplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis occurred. Incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis increased 2-fold (12%) in 2 studies; however, others have shown no difference. These findings may be secondary to the compounding effects of prematurity and the effect of the vitamin on the immune system. No other population has demonstrated these findings.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0One study has shown that alpha-tocopherol, at dosages of 50 mg/d, increased the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage by 50% (95% confidence interval [CI],\u00a0<i>P</i>\u00a0= 0.07) and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage by 181% (95% CI,\u00a0<i>P</i>\u00a0= 0.01) in men aged 50-69 years who smoked cigarettes compared to placebo. The risk of cerebral infarction was decreased 14% in the same patients. These results have not been found in any previous studies.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

Recommended pH values for test species listed in OECD guidelines are between 6.0 and almost 9. Acute testing with fish showed 96h-LC50 at about pH 3.5</p> <p>Iodine is an important element in studies of environmental protection and human health, global-scale hydrologic processes and nuclear nonproliferation. Biogeochemical cycling of iodine is complex, because iodine occurs in multiple oxidation states and as inorganic and organic species that may be hydrophilic, atmophilic, and biophilic. Experiments illustrate complex behavior with various processes occurring, including iodate reduction, irreversible retention or mass loss of iodide, and rate-limited and nonlinear sorption. There was an appreciable iodate reduction to iodide, presumably mediated by the structural Fe(II) in some clay minerals; therefore, careful attention must be given to potential interconversion among species when interpreting the biogeochemical behavior of iodine in the environment.</p> <p>Iodine (I2) is electrochemically reduced to ionic iodide by natural processes but humic acid appears to promote the reaction. The different oxidation species of iodine have markedly different sorption properties. Hence, changes in iodine redox states can greatly affect the mobility of iodine in the environment. A major microbial role has been suggested in the past to account for at least some of these redox changes. Both soluble ferrous iron and sulfide, as well as iron monosulfide (FeS) were shown to abiologically reduce iodate to iodide. These results indicate that ferric iron and/or sulfate reducing bacteria are capable of mediating both direct, enzymatic, as well as abiotic reduction of iodate in natural anaerobic environments.</p> <p>Environmental and geological evidence indicates that iodine can become associated with natural organic matter (NOM) in soils and sediments. Previous studies have shown that iodine (including\u00a0129II) can be strongly retained in organic-rich surface soils and sediment and that soluble iodine may be associated with dissolved humic material. Iodine and iodate undergo an abiotic pseudo first-order reaction with peat leading to either reduction of iodate or iodine to iodide or incorporation of the iodine atoms into the organic matrix. Iodine appears to be incorporated in sphagnum peat by aromatic substitution for hydrogen on phenolic constituents of the peat.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>|Toxicity Fish: LC50(96)36-200mg/L|Nitrif. inhib.  : slight inhib",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> #Iodine is an intense irritant to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin and a respiratory irritant in animals.

Excessive\r\nexposures may cause pulmonary conditions similar to those caused by exposure to\r\nchlorine gas (asphyxiation caused by cramps in the muscles of the larynx,\r\nfainting, coughing of blood, shortness of breath, cyanosis and chest pain).\r\nDelayed pulmonary oedema should be anticipated.</span></p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Irritation of the eyes may produce a heavy secretion of tears (lachrymation).</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The vapour when concentrated has pronounced eye irritation effects and this gives some warning of high vapour concentrations. If eye irritation occurs seek to reduce exposure with available control measures, or evacuate area.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>|Contact may result in rashes and rarely cutaneous hypersensitisation. Application of tincture to one third of the body has resulted in death.",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be seriously damaging to the health of the individual; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>Animal experiments suggest iodates are nephrotoxic, cause kidney damage. and may be haemolytic i.e. blood cell damage. Large doses produce vomiting. Iodate salts are 3-6 times more toxic to mice than are iodide salts.</p>|Ingestion may cause burns to the mouth, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Ingestion of amounts exceeding 2 gm may result in severe gastroenteritis, stupor, shock and death.",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, on the basis that similar materials tested in appropriate animal studies provide some suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Iodine and iodides may produce goitre and hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism. A mild toxic syndrome resulting from chronic iodide overdose and from repeated administration of small amounts of iodine (\"iodism\") is characterised by salivation, coryza, sneezing, conjunctivitis, headache, fever, laryngitis, bronchitis, stomatitis, parotitis (iodine mumps), and various skin rashes (iododerma*, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). Swelling and inflammation of the throat, irritated and swollen eyes and pulmonary oedema may also occur. Oedema of the glottis, necessitating tracheotomy has been reported. Occasional use of iodides for asthma in pregnancy has resulted in foetal death, severe goiter, hypothyroidism and the cretinoid appearance of the new-born. *Iododerma may vary from mild erythema and acneform eruptions to urticaria and suppurative or haemorrhagic rashes</p> <p>Iodine and iodides, whether applied topically or administered systemically, may produce allergic reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, cutaneous haemorrhage or purpuras, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p>|Long-term exposure will affect the respiratory system, eyes, skin, central nervous system, and cardiovascular system.  Diseases of the lungs, thyroid and kidneys will be aggravated by long-term exposure to iodine.|* Preplacement and periodic medical examinations of workers exposed to iodine should emphasize the lungs, kidneys and the thyroid.",

Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Copper is unlikely to accumulate in the atmosphere due to a short residence time for airborne copper aerosols. Airborne coppers, however, may be transported over large distances. Copper accumulates significantly in the food chain.</p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>3000 ug/l (UK max)</p> <p>2000 ug/l (WHO provisional Guideline)</p> <p>1000 ug/l (WHO level where individuals complain)</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: Dutch Criteria</p> <p>36 mg/kg (target)</p> <p>190 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: no data available.</p> <p>\u00a0The toxic effect of copper in the aquatic biota depends on the bio-availability of copper in water which, in turn, depends on its physico-chemical form (ie.speciation). \u00a0Bioavailability is decreased by complexation and adsorption of copper by natural organic matter, iron and manganese hydrated oxides, and chelating agents excreted by algae and other aquatic organisms. Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival. For high bioavailability waters, effect concentrations for several sensitive species may be below 10 ug Cu/litre.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In fish, the acute lethal concentration of copper ranges from a few ug/litre to several mg/litre, depending both on test species and exposure conditions. Where the value is less than 50 ug Cu/litre, test waters generally have a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) level, low hardness and neutral to slightly acidic pH. Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival. Lower effect concentrations are generally associated with test waters of high bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In summary:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Responses expected for high concentration ranges of copper *</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Total dissolved Cu concentration range (ug/litre)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Effects of high availability in water</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1-10</p>  </td> <td> <p>Significant effects are expected for diatoms and sensitive invertebrates, notably cladocerans.</p> <p>Effects on fish could be significant in freshwaters with low pH and hardness.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>10-100</p>  </td> <td> <p>Significant effects are expected on various species of microalgae, some species of macroalgae, and a range of invertebrates, including crustaceans, gastropods and sea urchins. \u00a0Survival of sensitive fish will be affected and a variety of fish show sublethal effects.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>100-1000</p>  </td> <td> <p>Most taxonomic groups of macroalgae and invertebrates will be severely affected. \u00a0Lethal levels for most fish species will be reached.</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>&gt;1000</p>  </td> <td> <p>Lethal concentrations for most tolerant organisms are reached.</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* Sites chosen have moderate to high bioavailability similar to water used in most toxicity tests.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In soil, copper levels are raised by application of fertiliser, fungicides, from deposition of highway dusts and from urban, mining and industrial sources. Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

Reports of allergic contact dermatitis following contact with copper and its salts have appeared in the literature, however the exposure concentrations leading to any effect have been poorly characterised. In one study, patch testing of 1190 eczema patients found that only 13 (1.1%) cross-reacted with 2% copper sulfate in petrolatum.

                "AcuteIngestion": "If vomiting does not occur immediately, systemic copper poisoning may occur; capillary damage, headache, cold sweat, weak pulse, kidney and liver damage may be the result of poisoning.|51nil<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Metals\r\nwhich form part of massive metals and their alloys, are &quot;locked&quot; into\r\na metal lattice; as a result they are not readily bioavailable following\r\ningestion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Secondary\r\nprocesses (e.g. change in pH or intervention by gastrointestinal\r\nmicroorganisms) may allow certain substances to be released in low\r\nconcentrations.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Not normally a hazard due to the physical form of product. The material is a physical irritant to the gastro-intestinal tract</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Numerous cases of a single oral exposure to high levels of copper have been reported. Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "Chronic exposure to copper dusts may result in runny nose, irritation of mucous membranes and atrophic changes with resultant dementia. Pre-existing skin, kidney, liver and pulmonary disorders may be aggravated by acute exposure.|55r33#? <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p>",

Therefore, pH would be an important\r\nfactor affecting the migration of cobalt in surface water.

In clay soil, adsorption may be\r\ndue to ion exchange at the cationic sites on clay with either simple ionic\r\ncobalt or hydrolysed ionic species such as CoOH+. Adsorption of cobalt onto\r\niron and manganese increases with pH. In addition, as pH increases, insoluble\r\nhydroxides or carbonates may form, which would also reduce cobalt mobility.\r\nConversely, sorption onto mobile colloids would enhance its mobility. In most\r\nsoils, cobalt is more mobile than lead, chromium (II), zinc, and nickel, but\r\nless mobile than cadmium. In several studies, the Kd of cobalt in a variety of\r\nsoils ranged from 0.2 to 3,800. The soil properties showing the highest\r\ncorrelation with Kd were exchangeable calcium, pH, water content, and cation\r\nexchange capacity. Organic complexing agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic\r\nacid (EDTA), which are used for decontamination operations at nuclear\r\nfacilities, greatly enhance the mobility of cobalt in soil.

Exposure to 9 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt hydrocarbonyl for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 months resulted in 16 deaths out of 75 rats. Death was reported in rats and mice exposed to 19 mg cobalt/m3 (but not 1.9 mg cobalt/m3) as cobalt sulfate over 16 days, but exposure to 11.4 mg cobalt/m3 over 13 weeks was lethal only to mice and not to rats.

As with exposures in humans, exposures of animals to cobalt-containing aerosols have resulted in pronounced respiratory effects. Animals exposed to aerosols of cobalt oxides and cobalt sulfate developed respiratory effects that varied in severity with exposure level and duration. A single 30-minute exposure of rats to relatively high levels (26-236 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt hydrocarbonyl) resulted in congestion, edema, and hemorrhage of the lung. Prolonged exposure (3-4 months) of rats and rabbits to mixed cobalt oxides (0.4-9 mg cobalt/m3) resulted in lesions in the alveolar region of the respiratory tract characterised histologically by nodular accumulation of Type II epithelial cells, accumulations of enlarged highly vacuolated macrophages, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis In at least one instance, the lesions appeared to regress when exposure was terminated . Guinea pigs sensitized to cobalt by repeated dermal application and then exposed to 2.4 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt chloride showed pulmonary inflammatory changes (altered BAL fluid recovery, increased neutrophils and eosinophils in the recovered BAL fluid) that were different than those in exposed animals not sensitised to cobalt. Decreased lung compliance was found in pigs exposed to 0.1 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt dust for 3 months. Lifetime exposure of hamsters to 7.9 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt oxide resulted in emphysema. Necrosis and inflammation of the respiratory tract epithelium (nasal turbinates, larynx, trachea, bronchioles) were reported in rats exposed to 19 mg cobalt/m3 and mice exposed to 1.9 mg cobalt/m3 or greater as cobalt sulfate over 16 days.

Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur.

Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>In general, available cohort studies in humans have not reported a significant increase in total mortality as a result of cobalt exposure. Several studies have noted increased mortality rates resulting from lung cancer following occupational exposure to cobalt, either as a mixture of cobalt compounds or as hard metal, a metal alloy with a tungsten carbide and cobalt matrix. \u00a0Fatal cases of hard metal disease and cardiomyopathy believed to have resulted from occupational cobalt exposure have also been reported. However, in the majority of these and other reported occupational studies, co-exposure to other substances was common, and was unable to be corrected for in the analysis.</p> <p>The effects of chronic occupational exposure to cobalt and cobalt compounds on the respiratory system in humans are well-documented. These effects include respiratory irritation, diminished pulmonary function, wheezing, asthma, pneumonia, and fibrosis and occurred at exposure levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.893 mg cobalt/m3 (exposure from 2 to 17 years). These effects have been observed in workers employed in cobalt refineries, as well as hard metal workers, diamond polishers, and ceramic dish painters (painting with cobalt blue dye).</p> <p>Occupational asthma attributed to the inhalation of cobalt powder has been confirmed following bronchial challenge tests. Chest tightness and chronic bronchitis have been recorded in hard-metal workers exposed to cobalt. Cobalt is known to function as a hapten, resulting in the generation of antibodies against cobalt-protein complexes. Although the minimum exposure level associated with cobalt sensitisation has not been determined, sensitisation has been demonstrated in hard metal workers with work-related asthma who have experienced prolonged occupational exposure (&gt;3 years) to levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.893 mg cobalt/m3. The sensitisation phenomenon includes the production of IgE and IgA antibodies to cobalt. Exposure to inhaled cobalt chloride aerosols can precipitate an asthmatic attack in sensitised individuals believed to be the result of an allergic reaction within the lungs.</p> <p>Allergic dermatitis of an erythematous papular type may also occur following occupational exposure. Dermatitis is a common result of dermal exposure to cobalt in humans that has been verified in a large number of studies. Using patch tests and intradermal injections, it has been demonstrated that the dermatitis is probably caused by an allergic reaction to cobalt. Contact allergy was reported in 22 of 223 (9.9%) nurses who were tested with a patch test of 1.0% cobalt chloride as well as 16 of 79 (20.3%) of examined dentists. Persons with body piercings showed an increased prevalence of allergy to cobalt, with the incidence of contact allergy being proportional to number of piercings The prevalence of sensitivity to cobalt following exposure to cobalt as a component of metal implants is low, with only 3.8% of patients developing a new sensitivity to cobalt following insertion of the implant</p> <p>Exposure levels associated with the development of dermatitis have not been identified. It appears that the allergic properties of cobalt result mainly from exposure to the metal itself, rather than a salt, as it has been demonstrated that daily repeated exposure to aqueous cobalt salts did not result in hand eczema in patients known to have cobalt allergy.</p> <p>Occupational exposure to cobalt in humans has been reported to cause several effects on the nervous system, including memory loss , nerve deafness, and a decreased visual acuity. It should be noted though, that both of the studies reporting on these findings, \u00a0had small numbers of subjects, and exposure characterization was not reported.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to cobalt produces polycythaemia (increase in blood haemoglobin), increased production of cells of the bone marrow and thyroid gland, pericardial effusion and damage to the alpha cells of the pancreas. Chronic exposure to cobalt compounds may result in pericardial effusion, polycardial effusion, cardiac failure, vomiting, convulsions and thyroid enlargement.</p> <p>Chronic administration of cobaltous chloride has produced goiter, reduced thyroid activity and lowered synthesis rates and levels of cytochrome P-450, an enzymatic system responsible for chemical detoxification, in the liver. \u00a0A toxic nephritis (kidney disease) may also develop.</p> <p>Epidemic cardiomyopathy (heart disease) among heavy beer drinkers in the 1960's in Canada, the USA and Belgium has been attributed to the addition of up to 1.5 ppm of cobalt as a foam restorative and stabiliser. Other factors are probably implicated as therapeutic doses of cobalt, up to 50 mg/day (in the treatment of refractory anaemias) do not produce this effect. Inadequate protein or vitamin intake amongst heavy drinkers, or the effects of alcohol in rendering the heart more susceptible to disease may be important.</p> <p>\u00a0Single and repeated subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of cobalt powder and salts to rats may cause sarcoma at the injection site but evidence for carcinogenicity by any other route of exposure does not exist. A number of single cases of malignant tumours, mostly sarcomas, have been reported at the site of orthopedic implants containing cobalt.</p> <p>\u00a0Animals, exposed to cobalt compounds also exhibit an increase in respiration, as well as tremor and convulsion. Exposure of rats and mice to aerosols of cobalt (as cobalt sulfate) at concentrations from 0.11 to 1.14 mg cobalt/m3 for 2 years resulted in a spectrum of inflammatory, fibrotic, and proliferative lesions in the respiratory tract of male and female rats and mice. Squamous metaplasia of the larynx occurred in rats and mice at exposure concentrations of .0.11 mg cobalt/m3, with severity of the lesion increasing with increased cobalt concentration. Hyperplastic lesions of the nasal epithelium occurred in rats at concentrations of .0.11 mg cobalt/3, and in mice at concentrations of .0.38 mg cobalt/m3. Both sexes of rats had greatly increased incidences (&gt;90% incidence) of alveolar lesions at all exposure levels, including inflammatory changes, fibrosis, and metaplasia. Similar changes were seen in mice at all exposure levels, though the changes in mice were less severe.</p> <p>\u00a0Cobalt metal dust inhalations by miniature swine resulted in early marked decrease in lung compliance and increases in septal collagen. After a one-week \"sensitising period\", followed by a 10-day lapse period, further exposures resulted in wheezing produced by hypersensitivity reactions.</p> <p>Sensitisation may give severe responses to very low levels of exposure, in situations where exposure may occur.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Feeding of plants from seleniferous rocks has been the cause of toxic effects in livestock. Environmental redistribution of selenium due to man's activity is due to copper smelting; lead, zinc, phosphate, and uranium mining; manufacture of glass ceramics and pigments; and burning of fuels.</p> <p>\u00a0Early concerns about selenium toxicity have given way to recognition of certain beneficial properties. Selenium is thought to possess some anti-carcinogenic activity and to protect against the toxicity of heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury and silver.</p> <p>Sediment micro-organisms produce dimethyl selenide and dimethyl diselenide from both inorganic and organic sources and contribute to its biogeochemical cycling. Bacteria and cyanobacteria have two possible mechanisms for the uptake and transformation of selenate. The uptake mechanism involves the reduction of selenate to elemental selenium that will be physically held within the biological mat. The microorganisms are also found to cause the transformation of soluble selenium into volatile alkyl selenium compounds. Aquatic organisms can convert selenium to both inert and soluble forms. Duckweed, phytoplankton,bacteria, and fungi have been demonstrated to synthesise selenoamino acids from absorbed inorganic selenium compounds. These selenoamino acids are not likely to be found at significant dissolved concentrations in water, however, because amino acids are rapidly catabolised by\u00a0bacteria.\u00a0Benthic bacteria and fungi are capable of methylating elemental and inorganic selenium salts</p> <p>Hydrogen selenide can be formed in a reducing environment. Both hydrogen selenide and the methylated forms of selenium are unstable in water and would be expected to rapidly volatilise to the atmosphere</p> <p>The behavior of selenium in the environment is influenced to a large degree by its oxidation state and the consequent differences in the behavior of its different chemical compounds. The oxidation state of selenium in the environment is dependent on ambient conditions, particularly on pH, pE, and biological activity. The volatile selenium compounds that partition into the atmosphere include the inorganic compounds, selenium dioxide and hydrogen selenide, and the organic compounds, dimethyl selenide and dimethyl diselenide. Hydrogen selenide is highly reactive in air and is rapidly oxidised to elemental selenium and water, but the other compounds can persist in air. Selenium compounds released to the atmosphere can be removed by dry or wet deposition to soils or to surface water. The forms of selenium expected to be found in surface water and the water contained in soils are the salts of selenic and selenious acids. Selenic acid (H2SeO4) is a strong acid. The soluble selenate salts of this acid are expected to occur in alkaline waters. Sodium selenate is one of the most mobile selenium compounds in the environment because of its high solubility and inability to adsorb onto soil particles. Selenious acid (H2SeO3) is a weak acid, and the diselenite ion predominates in waters between pH 3.5 and 9. Most selenites are less soluble in water than the corresponding selenates.</p> <p>Selenium in an aquatic environment is bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms; \u00a0bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 150-1,850 and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of 1,746-,975 have been reported for selenium in freshwater. The degree of bioaccumulation of selenium exhibited a stable pattern over several years, with selenium concentrations (wet weight) as follows: fish (6-35 mg/kg) &gt; benthic insects (12-15 mg/kg) &gt; annelids (10-12 mg/kg) &gt; molluscs and crustaceans (5-9 mg/kg) &gt; periphyton (4-6 mg/kg). In fish, selenium was concentrated in visceral tissue (25-35 mg/kg wet weight) more than in skeletal muscle (6-11 mg/kg wet weight). The BCFs and BAFs for selenium in visceral tissue (i.e., heart, hepatopancreas, spleen, and gonads) of fish have been estimated to range from 35 to 1,850 and from 1,058 to 3,980, respectively. Selenite was more concentrated than selenate for algae and daphnids, whereas bluegills concentrated both inorganic species about equally . Selenium accumulation from selenomethionine occurred more readily than from selenite or selenate.\u00a0Some evidence indicates that selenium might biomagnify in aquatic organisms under natural conditions.\u00a0Biomagnification is evidenced by progressively higher concentrations of an element or substance in organisms at successively higher trophic levels. More than 50% of the selenium contained in sediments in ponds and reservoirs appears to occurs in organic forms, resulting from the synthesis and bioaccumulation of organic selenium before the plants die and decay on the bottom.</p> <p>In soils, pH and Eh are determining factors in the transport and partitioning of selenium. Elemental selenium is essentially insoluble and may represent a major inert \"sink\" for selenium introduced into the environment under anaerobic conditions. Heavy metal selenides and selenium sulfides, which are also insoluble, predominate in acidic (low pH) soils and in soils with high amounts of organic matter. Selenium in this form is immobile and will remain in the soil. The selenides of other metals such as copper and cadmium are of low solubility. Sodium and potassium selenites dominate in neutral, well-drained mineral soils, where some soluble metal selenites may be found as well. In alkaline (pH&gt;7.5), well-oxidized soil environments, selenates are the major selenium species. Because of their high solubility and low tendency to adsorb onto soil particles, the selenates are very mobile and are readily taken up by biological systems or leached through the soil. The reported Kd values (distribution coefficient = [concentration of selenium sorbed on soil or rock]/[concentration of selenium in solution]) are 14.9 mL/g for sandy loam and 5.91 mL/g for sludge treated sandy soils. Selenite forms stable ferric oxide-selenite adsorption complexes in acid or neutral soils.</p> <p>When environments favor the soluble forms of selenium (alkaline and oxidizing conditions), these forms can be accumulated by plants. In addition, although both selenite (Se4+) and selenate (Se6+) are soluble forms of selenium, selenate was found to be the preferred form of selenium taken up by plants. Preferential uptake of selenate may be caused by its tendency to be less strongly adsorbed to soil particles and organic matter than selenite. Selenium uptake by plants is influenced by many factors including soil type, pH, colloidal content, concentration of organic material, oxidation-reduction potentials in the root-soil environment, and total level of selenium in the soil. In acidic soils (pH 4.5-6.5) and under high moisture conditions, selenium is in the form of selenite and is bound to colloids as iron hydroxide selenium complexes. These complexes are insoluble and generally not bioavailable to plants. In basic soils (pH 7.5-8.5), selenium is present as soluble selenate. The use of lime and plant ash as fertilizers, which would raise the pH of the soil and favor the formation of selenate, has been implicated as a contributing factor in the accumulation of selenium in crops grown in high selenium soil found in certain regions of China.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur. Tolerance to the fumes develops rapidly, but is quickly lost. All symptoms usually subside within 24-36 hours following removal from exposure.</p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Acute selenium poisoning produces nervousness, convulsions, drowsiness, frontal headaches and in extreme cases, death from respiratory depression. Skin eruptions, lassitude, gastrointestinal disturbance and discolouration of teeth are also symptomatic of selenium intoxication. An odorous garlic breath and partial loss of hair and nails may also indicate over-exposure. The gastrointestinal absorption of selenium (as selenites, selenates or seleniferous compounds) is rapid.Acute toxicity of soluble selenite compounds is high ( &gt; selenates and insoluble inorganic salts). Consumption of 1-5 mg of sodium selenite by 5 adults caused nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tremor which resolved</p> <p>in 24 hours. Most absorbed selenium is complexed by plasma protein and is subsequently deposited in the liver and kidneys. Excretion is by urine, faeces, sweat and breath. The major urinary metabolite is probably trimethylselenonium ion. Selenates (and to a lesser degree selenites) are general protoplasmic poisons attacking sulfhydryl enzymes. As with arsenic they cause degenerative lesions of the kidney, heart, spleen, stomach, and bowels. Accidental exposure of several female laboratory workers to selenite resulted in several miscarriages; this result is equivocal as epidemiological studies actually suggest that neonatal deaths declined as environmental selenium rose.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or long-term occupational exposure is likely to produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Chronic exposures to selenium and its salts and compounds produce bronchial irritation, gastrointestinal problems, nasopharyngeal irritation and a persistent garlic odour on the breath (this odour is thought to be due respiratory excretions of the metabolite dimethylselenium). A metallic taste is frequently reported by workers. Pallor, irritability, excessive fatigue are also thought to be symptomatic of industrial exposures over a number of years. Renal and hepatic lesions, produced in experimental animals, are occasionally mentioned in case histories. Both experimental and epidemiologic studies support the proposition that selenium increases dental caries. Excessive intake of selenium in farm animals results in blind staggers, anorexia, emaciation and collapse. Lower concentrations produce hair and hoof loss and a reduction of reproductive capacity. Liver damage, nephritis, hyperemia and ulceration of the upper gastrointestinal tract are evident at autopsy.</p> <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
