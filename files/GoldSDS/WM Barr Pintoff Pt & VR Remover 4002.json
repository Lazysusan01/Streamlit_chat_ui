In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Volatilisation of\r\nmethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process\r\ngiven a Henry's Law constant of 4.55x10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for\r\nvolatilisation of methanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon a vapor\r\npressure of 127 mm Hg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate\r\nprocess for methanol based on half-lives of 1 and 3.2 days measured in a sandy\r\nsilt loam and sandy loam from Texas and Mississippi, respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">AQUATIC FATE: The estimated Koc indicates that methanol is not\r\nexpected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water\r\nsurfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law\r\nconstant estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake\r\nare 3 and 35 days, respectively. A BCF of less than 10 measured in fish, suggests\r\nbioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in\r\nsunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate\r\nprocess for methanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse\r\nor absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Methanol has been\r\nshown to undergo rapid biodegradation in a variety of screening studies using\r\nsewage seed and activated sludge inoculum, which suggests that biodegradation\r\nwill occur in aquatic environments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle\r\npartitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour\r\npressure, methanol is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient\r\natmosphere. Vapour-phase methanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction\r\nwith photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this\r\nreaction in air is estimated to be 17 days, calculated from its rate constant\r\nof 9.4x10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h) fathead minnow\u00a0<i>(Pimephales promelus)</i>\u00a029000\r\nmg/l; rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhyncus mykiss</i>) 19000 mg/l; bluegill (<i>Lepomis\r\nmacrochirus</i>) 15400 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (7 d): guppy 10860 mg/l (14 d): 11.5 mg/l (semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia pulex LC50 (18 h): 19500 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brine shrimp (<i>Artemia salina</i>) LC50 24 h): 1101.46-1578.84\r\nmg/l (static)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brown shrimp (<i>Crangon crangon</i>) LC50 (96 h): 1340 mg/l\r\n(semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) LC50 (96 h): 15900 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Marine bacterium (<i>Photobacterium posphoreum</i>) LC50 (4 h):\r\n7690 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Protozoa (<i>Tetrahymena pyriformis</i>) LC50 (48 h) 18756 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

NPEs are a\r\nclear to light orange coloured liquid. They are amphipathic, meaning they have\r\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, which allows them to surround\r\nnon-polar substances like oil and grease, isolating them from water</span></p>",

It is not readily\r\nbiodegradable, and it can take months or longer to degrade in surface waters,\r\nsoils, and sediments. Nonbiological degradation is negligible. Many products\r\nthat contain nonylphenol have \"down-the-drain\" applications, such as laundry\r\nand dish soap, so the contaminants are frequently introduced into the water\r\nsupply. In sewage treatment plants, nonylphenol ethoxylate degrades into\r\nnonylphenol, which is found in river water and sediments as well as soil and\r\ngroundwater. Nonylphenol photodegrades in sunlight, but its half-life in\r\nsediment is estimated to be more than 60 years. Although the concentration of\r\nnonylphenol in the environment is decreasing, it is still found at\r\nconcentrations of 4.1 \u00b5g/L in river waters and 1 mg/kg in sediments. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A major concern is that\r\ncontaminated sewage sludge is frequently recycled onto agricultural land. The\r\ndegradation of nonylphenol in soil depends on oxygen availability and other\r\ncomponents in the soil. Mobility of nonylphenol in soil is low.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation is significant in\r\nwater-dwelling organisms and birds, and nonylphenol has been found in internal\r\norgans of certain animals at concentrations of 10 to 1,000 times greater than\r\nthe surrounding environment. Due to this bioaccumulation and persistence of nonylphenol,\r\nit has been suggested that nonylphenol could be transported over long distances\r\nand have a global reach that stretches far from the site of contamination.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenol is not persistent in\r\nair, as it is rapidly degraded by hydroxyl radicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenol is considered to be\r\nan endocrine disruptor due to its ability to mimic estrogen and in turn disrupt\r\nthe natural balance of hormones in affected organisms.The effect is weak\r\nbecause nonylphenols are not very close structural mimics of estradiol, but the\r\nlevels of nonylphenol can be sufficiently high to compensate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The effects of nonylphenol in the\r\nenvironment are most applicable to aquatic species. Nonylphenol can cause\r\nendocrine disruption in fish by interacting with estrogen receptors and\r\nandrogen receptors. Studies report that nonylphenol competitively displaces\r\nestrogen from its receptor site in rainbow trout. It has a stronger affinity to\r\nthe E2 receptor than estrogen. Nonylphenol causes the feminization of aquatic\r\norganisms, decreases male fertility, and decreases survival in young fish.\r\nStudies show that male fish exposed to nonylphenol have lower testicular\r\nweight. Nonylphenol can disrupt steroidogenesis in the liver. One function of\r\nendogenous estrogen in fish is to stimulate the liver to make vitellogenin,\r\nwhich is a phospholipoprotein. Vitellogenin is released by the maturing female\r\nand sequestered by developing oocytes to produce the egg yolk. Males do not\r\nnormally produce vitellogenin, but when exposed to nonylphenol they produce similar\r\nlevels of vitellogenin to females. The concentration needed to induce\r\nvitellogenin production in fish is 10 ug/L for NP in water. Nonylphenol can\r\nalso interfere with the level of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) being\r\nreleased from the pituitary gland. Concentrations of NP that inhibit\r\nreproductive development and function in fish also damages kidneys, decreases\r\nbody weight, and induces stressed behavior.</span></p> <p>Surfactants are in general toxic to aquatic organisms due to their surface-active properties. Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For high boiling ethylene glycol ethers;</p> <p>These chemicals form a category based on similar structural, physiochemical and toxicological properties. Triethylene- and tetraethylene- glycol ethers represent typical members of the category. All category members can be represented by the generic molecular formula:</p> <p>HO(CH2CH2O)nR - n=2,3,4,5,6 and higher ethylene units and R=alkyl(methyl, ethyl, butyl etc.)</p> <p>All are high boiling liquids of low volatility and high water solubility. Higher molecular weight species and surrogates may be solids at ambient temperatures.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Estimated photodegradation hydroxyl radical rate constants \u00a0for category members are in close agreement. Photodegradation half-lives of triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE), tetraethylene glycol methyl ether (TetraME), and tetraethylene glycol butyl ether (TetraBE) (estimated using the EPIWIN/AOP model) have atmospheric photodegradation half-lives of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 hours respectively.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Ether groups are generally stable to water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. The ether function is hydrolysed by heating in the presence of halogen acids, particularly hydrogen iodide.</p> <p><b>Volatilisation</b>: The category members are highly soluble to miscible in water, possess high boiling points (in excess of 250 C) and low vapour pressures. The estimated Henry's Law Constants, fall in the narrow range of 3.54 E-14 to 3.67 E-13 m3* atm/mol at 25 C point to a limited volatilisation potential.</p> <p><b>Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The ethers in this category possess physical properties that suggest that once they enter the aqueous compartment, they tend to remain dissolved in water. Soil/sediment partition coefficients (Koc) of 10 have been estimated for TGBE, TetraME and TetraBE . These results suggest that the category members have uniformly high soil mobility. Thus, these products can leach from soil deposits to groundwater, but can also be transported to environments where aerobic biodegradation can take place.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>When released to water, some studies show that biodegradation of category members is reasonably rapid . OECD guideline studies indicate biodegradability (&gt; 90%) for TGBE (ready or inherent) and TetraME (inherent). However,another comparative biodegradation study of triethylene glycol methyl ether (TGME), triethylene glycol ethyl ether (TGEE) and triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE) indicate slower rates of biodegradation (from 47-71%). Altogether, the data suggest that different study methodologies provide variable results for the tri- and tetraethylene glycol ethers. No category members or surrogates that were tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>The category members have a limited potential to bioaccumulate (based on log Kow's ranging from -1.73 to +0.51, 20 C), and predicted bioconcentration factors, log BCF = ca. 0.50</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The data suggest that trimethyl, -ethyl and -butyl ethers and are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.</p> <p>The LC50 values for fish, Daphnia, and algae are 2,400 mg/l, \u00a02,210 mg/l, and &gt; 500 mg/l, respectively. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers. Due to the structural and physical similarities of TetraME and TetraBE with the other glycol ethers in the category, it is likely that these glycol ethers are also of low toxicity to aquatic species</p> <p>The toxicity of TGBE, TetraME, TGEE and TGME to bacteria also has been tested. In sewer microorganisms exposed to TGBE, TGEE and TGME for 16 hours, the LD50 values were &gt; 5,000, &gt;10,000 and &gt;5,000 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of TetraME required to cause inhibition of respiration of activated sludge is reportedly &gt; 12,500 mg/kg for 3 hours\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">The production and use of\r\nnonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates is prohibited in the European Union due\r\nto its effects on health and the environment. In Europe, due to environmental\r\nconcerns, they also have been replaced by more expensive alcohol ethoxylates,\r\nwhich are less problematic for the environment due to their ability to degrade\r\nmore quickly than nonylphenols. The European Union has also included NP on the\r\nlist of priority hazardous substances for surface water in the Water Framework\r\nDirective. They are now implementing a drastic reduction policy of NP's in\r\nsurface waterways. The Environmental quality standard for NP was proposed to be\r\n0.3 ug/l. Nonylphenols are registered on the REACH candidate list. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the US, the EPA set criteria\r\nwhich recommends that nonylphenol concentration should not exceed 6.6 ug/l in\r\nfresh water and 1.7 ug/l in saltwater. In order to do so, the EPA is supporting\r\nand encouraging a voluntary phase-out of nonylphenol in industrial laundry\r\ndetergents. Similarly, the EPA is documenting proposals for a \"significant\r\nnew use\" rule, which would require companies to contact the EPA if they\r\ndecided to add nonylphenol to any new cleaning and detergent products. They\r\nalso plan to do more risk assessments to ascertain the effects of nonylphenol\r\non human health and the environment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In other Asian and South American\r\ncountries nonylphenol is still widely available in commercial detergents, and\r\nthere is little regulation</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for alcohol ethoxylates</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alcohol (alkyl) ethoxylates (AEs) are generally biodegradable and do not persist for any substantial period in the environment. They are not usually present a concentrations which might produce problems. Contamination of natural waters, however, should be avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The biodegradability of the alcohol ethoxylates (AE) is relatively unaffected by the alkyl carbon chain length and the number of EO units. The linear AE are normally easily degraded under aerobic conditions. Only small differences are seen in the time needed for ultimate degradation of linear AE with different alkyl chain lengths. AE with a typical alkyl chain (e.g., C12 to C15) will normally reach more than 60% degradation in standardized tests for \"ready\" biodegradability. The rate of biodegradation may however be determined by the length of the ethylene oxide (EO) chain. Longer EO chains decrease the bioavailability of the AE (to microorganism) due to increased hydrophilicity and molecular size, which limits the transport of the molecule through the cell wall. The biodegradation of branched AE tends to be slower than biodegradation of linear AE. The biodegradability of AE depends on degree and structure of the branching. The general trend is that the biodegradation decreases considerably with an increasing branching of the carbon chain. The biodegradability of alcohol alkoxylates (AA), similarly, generally decreases with an increasing number of PO units. AA containing 6 PO units did not pass the level required for ready biodegradability whereas the same alcohol containing 2 PO units attained 83% ThOD in the closed bottle test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mineralization observed in experiments with 14C-labelled surfactants suggests that almost complete degradation of linear AE may be expected in anaerobic digesters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available information suggests that alcohol ethoxylates can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic organisms. These effects vary by carbon chain length. Typical alcohol ethoxylate surfactant chain length ranges from 9 to 18 carbons and 3 to 8 ethoxylate groups. Toxicity generally declines as the number of ethoxylates increases</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A summary of chronic toxicity data from 60 studies conducted between 1977 and 2004 on fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plant and algae species states that alcohol ethoxylates\u2019 effects on aquatic species include reduced growth rates, impaired reproduction, and reduced survival of neonates, as well as acute mortality. Alcohol ethoxylates may cause diminished growth rates and reduced cell counts in algae species at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg/L .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The concentrations at which alcohol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality in aquatic species are similar to the concentrations at which nonylphenol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality. However, alcohol ethoxylates degrade more quickly in the aquatic environment to relatively non-toxic compounds, whereas nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation typically yields nonylphenol, which is toxic as well as persistent in the aquatic environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Algae constitute the group of aquatic organisms which appears to be the most sensitive to AE. The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. For the linear AE, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length of C13 ) and decreasing EO chain length. The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to invertebrates varies with EC50 values from 0.1 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.5 mg/l to 50 mg/l for the branched types. The toxicity is species specific and may vary between 0.29 mg/l to 270 mg/l for the same linear AE The most commonly used invertebrates for testing are\u00a0Daphnia magna\u00a0and\u00a0Daphnia pulex, and they are also among the most sensitive invertebrates to AE. Apparently, the toxicity of AE to invertebrates was not related to hydrophobicity as it is the case for algae. Some AE are very toxic to invertebrates, i.e., linear AE of C12-15 EO1-8 and branched AE with a low degree of branching, i.e. &lt; 10-25%. Branching of the alkyl chain reduces the toxicity of AE to invertebrates as also observed for algae.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to fish varies with LC50 values from 0.4 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.25 mg/l to 40 mg/l for the branched AE. For linear AE the toxicity increases with decreasing EO units. AE containing 7-11 EO groups are considered to be very toxic to fish (EC/LC50: 1 mg/l).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special interest are the aryl alcohol ethoxylates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A EU Risk Assessment Report (RAR) concluded that octyl- and nonyl- phenol ethoxylates are\u00a0not readily biodegradable but are inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As a group, these materials are generally toxic to fish with LC50s ranging, typically, between 1-6 mg/l.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special concern are the following families which are classified as\u00a0\"Environmentally Hazardous Substances\"\u00a0(Dangerous Goods Class 9) by either or both the ADR (Accord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Merchandises Dangerous par Route) and the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C 6-17 (secondary) with 3-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C12-15 with 1-3 moles of ethoxylation (1-6 moles of ethoxylation IMDG)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C13-15 with 1-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">New aquatic data suggests that alcohols C 8-9 branched with 3-10 moles of ethoxylation alcohols C 8-9 branched with &gt; 10 moles of ethoxylation should also be classified as\u00a0'harmful to the environment\".</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These alcohols may also be found linked to aromatic structures (in nonylphenol ethoxylates for example).

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.
