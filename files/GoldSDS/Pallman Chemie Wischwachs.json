This should not be confused however with bees wax, which consists primarily of esters.Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen (asphalt), used for example in road surfacing.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

Higher molecular weight (higher carbon\r\nnumber) components are even less water soluble. Based on water solubility\r\nmodeling for C13 components of complex mixtures, aqueous solubilities of these\r\nwaxes are typically much less than 1 ppm, due to differential partitioning of\r\ncomponents between the aqueous and organic phases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrolysis:\r\n</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Materials in the waxes category are not subject to hydrolysis, as\r\nthey lack these reactive groups with which a water molecule or hydroxide ion\r\nreacts to form a new carbon-oxygen bond.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Photodegradation:\r\n</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Although waxes typically have low vapour pressures, volatilisation\r\nof some lower molecular weight components exhibit relatively high atmospheric\r\noxidation half-lives.

Percent distribution estimates were modeled with C13 to\r\nC29 branched paraffins as this class of wax hydrocarbons shows the greater\r\ndistribution to air. Aromatic compounds with carbon numbers from C13 through\r\nC85 will partition principally to soil. Linear paraffins and naphthenes\r\ndistribute to both soil and air, with increasing partitioning to soil for\r\nhydrocarbons greater than C20 as vapour pressure decreases. Since the majority\r\nof hydrocarbon components in waxes are primarily normal paraffins of C20. and\r\ngreater, with moderate to minimal amounts of naphthenics, isoparaffins and\r\ntrace amounts of aromatics, volatility is not a significant fate process for\r\nthese petroleum substances due to negligible vapor pressures at ambient\r\ntemperatures and their high molecular weight. As hydrocarbon number increases\r\nabove C20, partitioning to soil is the predominant behavior of these compounds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradation:\r\n</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Not readily biodegradable; inherently biodegradable and\r\nextensively biodegradable in long-term exposures.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",

This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p>|Large doses may act as a laxative.",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Implantation studies in rats show that paraffin oils may be tumourigen. As a general rule the highly refined paraffins contain a lower level of suspect polyaromatic hydrocarbons than less refined grades and also less than waxes derived from naphthenic base-stocks.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Principal route of exposure is by skin contact; lesser exposures include inhalation of fumes from hot oils, oil mists or droplets. Prolonged contact with mineral oils carries with it the risk of skin conditions such as oil folliculitis, eczematous dermatitis, pigmentation of the face (melanosis) and warts on the sole of the foot (plantar warts). \u00a0With highly refined mineral oils no appreciable systemic effects appear to result through skin absorption.</p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to oil mists frequently elicits respiratory conditions, such as asthma; the provoking agent is probably an additive. High oil mist concentrations may produce lipoid pneumonia although clinical evidence is equivocal. In animals exposed to concentrations of 100 mg/m3 oil mist, for periods of 12 to 26 months, the activity of lung and serum alkaline phosphatase enzyme was raised; 5 mg/m3 oil mist did not produce this response. These enzyme changes are sensitive early indicators of lung damage. Workers exposed to vapours of mineral oil and kerosene for 5 to 35 years showed an increased prevalence of slight basal lung fibrosis.</p>",
