Very large doses of ammonium salts may produce a drop in blood pressure, collapse, central nervous system disorders, spasms, narcosis, respiratory paralysis and haemolysis.</p> <p>Large doses of ammonium salts may be sufficiently absorbed to produce diuresis and systemic ammonia poisoning. Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated minor exposure to ammonia gas/vapour may cause long-term irritation to the eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract. Repeated exposure or prolonged contact may produce dermatitis, and conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Other effects may include ulcerative changes to the mouth and bronchial and gastrointestinal disturbances. Adaptation to usually irritating concentrations may result in tolerance. In animals, repeated exposures to sub-lethal levels produces adverse effects on the respiratory tract, liver, kidneys and spleen. Exposure at 675 ppm for several weeks produced eye irritation in dogs and rabbits; corneal opacity, covering between a quarter to one half of the total surface area, was evident in rabbits.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">The polymer contained in this\r\nproduct has a reactive group generally considered to be of high concern (US\r\nEPA).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are health concerns for\r\npolymers containing pendant acrylates, based on the sensitisation properties of\r\nacrylates in general and the carcinogenicity of some members of the group. e.g.\r\nethyl acrylate Whilst it is generally accepted that polymers with a molecular\r\nweight exceeding 1000 are unlikely to pass through biological membranes,\r\noligomers with lower molecular weight and specifically, those with a molecular\r\nweight below 500, may. Estimations based on a \"highly\" dispersed\r\npolymer population suggest that a polymer of approximate molecular weight 5000\r\ncould contain no more than one reactive group of high concern for it to be\r\nregulated as a polymer of low concern (a so-called PLC) Polymers with a\r\nmolecular weight above 10000 are generally considered to be PLCs because these\r\nare not expected to be absorbed by biological systems. The choice of 10000 as a\r\ncut-off value is thought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as\r\nreasonable in light of limited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which\r\neffects are seen, and extrapolation from animals to humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ingredients in the Acrylates\r\nCopolymer group all contain the monomers acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or\r\none of their salts or esters. These ingredients are considered similar in that\r\nthey are uniformly produced in chemical reactions that leave very little\r\nresidual monomer. Although residual acrylic acid may be as high as 1500 ppm,\r\ntypical levels are 10 to 1000 ppm. There is sufficient odor if residual\r\nmonomers are present to cause producers to keep levels as low as possible.\r\nThese ingredients function in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair\r\nfixatives, suspending agents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion\r\nstabilizers. Concentrations may be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film\r\nformer, or fixative; or as low as 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent,\r\nsuspending agent, or emulsion stabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit\r\nlittle toxicity. In rabbits and guinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce\r\nirritation, but no evidence of sensitization was found. The principle concern\r\nregarding the use of these polymer ingredients is the presence of toxic\r\nresidual monomers. In particular, although 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ngenotoxic, it was carcinogenic when applied at a concentration of 21% to the\r\nskin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations (2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high\r\nconcentrations (43%) were not carcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ncarcinogenic in studies using NMRI mice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis\r\nwas seen or not, there was evidence of severe dermal irritation in these\r\n2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another concern regarding residual monomers was\r\ninhalation toxicity. Although the acrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant,\r\nexposure to the monomer from use of these polymers in cosmetic formulations\r\nwould always be less than the established occupational exposure limits for\r\nnasal irritation. Although there appears to be a huge variation in the mix of\r\nmonomers used in the synthesis of these polymers, they are similar in that the\r\npolymers, except for dermal irritation, are not significantly toxic, and\r\nresidual monomer levels are kept as low as possible. Although the monomers may\r\nbe toxic, the levels that would be found in cosmetic formulations are not\r\nconsidered to present a safety risk. Accordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are\r\nconsidered safe for use in cosmetic formulations when formulated to avoid\r\nirritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>",
