Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Exposure to doses sufficiently high to produce intoxication and unconsciousness also produces transient liver and kidney toxicity.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard.

In addition the US EPA's procedures for risk assessment for hazard identification and dose-response assessment as applied by NIOSH were used in the creation of such limits.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Volatilisation of n-butyl acetate is expected from moist soil surfaces given its Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilisation from dry soil surfaces is expected based on a measured vapor pressure of 11.5 mm Hg. Using a standard BOD dilution technique and a sewage inoculum, theoretical BODs of 56 % to 86 % were observed during 5-20 day incubation periods, which suggests that n-butyl acetate may biodegrade in soil.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value indicates that n-butyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Butyl acetate is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on a Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 127, hours respectively. An estimated BCF value of 10 based on the log Kow, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using a filtered sewage seed, 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 58 % and 83 % were measured in freshwater dilution tests; 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 40 % and 61 % were measured in salt water. A 5-day theoretical BOD of 56.8 % and 51.8 % were measured for n-butyl acetate in distilled water and seawater, respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate for this compound based upon experimentally determined hydrolysis half-lives of 114 and 11 days at pH 8 and 9 respectively.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, n-butyl acetate, which has a vapour pressure of 11.5 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase n-butyl acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 4 days</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h, 23 C): island silverside (Menidia beryllina) 185 ppm (static bioassay in synthetic seawater, mild aeration applied after 24 h); bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 100 ppm (static bioassay in fresh water, mild aeration applied after 24 h)</p> <p>Fish EC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 18 mg/l (affected fish lost equilibrium prior to death)\u00a0</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (48 h): 44 ppm</p> <p>Algal LC50 (96 h): Scenedesmus 320 ppm</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

These effects become greater as the molecular weights and boiling points increase. Central nervous system depression , headache, drowsiness, dizziness, coma and neurobehavioral changes may also be symptomatic of overexposure. Respiratory tract involvement may produce mucous membrane irritation, dyspnea, and tachypnea, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis and, in massive exposures, pulmonary oedema (which may be delayed). Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Liver and kidney damage may result from massive exposures.</p> <p>Prolonged exposure may cause headache, nausea and ultimately loss of consciousness.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Ethylbenzene is volatile and when released will quickly vaporize. Photodegradation is the primary route of removal in the environment. Photodegradation is estimated with a half-life of 1 day. Ethylbenzene is considered inherently biodegradable and removal from water occurs primarily by evaporation but in the summer biodegradation plays a key role in the removal process. Level I and Level III fugacity modeling indicate that partitioning is primarily to the air compartment, 98 and 96%, respectively.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "StorageIncompatability": "<ul> <li>Glycol ethers may form peroxides under certain conditions; the potential for peroxide formation is enhanced when these substances are used in processes such as distillation where they are concentrated or even evaporated to near-dryness or dryness; storage under a nitrogen atmosphere is recommended to minimise the possible formation of highly reactive peroxides\u00a0</li> <li>Nitrogen blanketing is recommended if transported in containers at temperatures within 15 deg C of the flash-point and at or above the flash-point - large containers may first need to be purged and inerted with nitrogen prior to loading\u00a0</li> <li>In the presence of strong bases or the salts of strong bases, at elevated temperatures, the potential exists for runaway reactions.\u00a0</li> <li>Contact with aluminium should be avoided; release of hydrogen gas may result- glycol ethers will corrode scratched aluminium surfaces.\u00a0</li> <li>May discolour in mild steel/ copper; lined containers, glass or stainless steel is preferred\u00a0</li> <li>Glycols and their ethers undergo violent decomposition in contact with 70% perchloric acid. This seems likely to involve formation of the glycol perchlorate esters (after scission of ethers) which are explosive, those of ethylene glycol and 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol being more powerful than glyceryl nitrate, and the former so sensitive that it explodes on addition of water . Investigation of the hazards associated with use of 2-butoxyethanol for alloy electropolishing showed that mixtures with 50-95% of acid at 20 deg C, or 40-90% at 75 C, were explosive and initiable by sparks. Sparking caused mixtures with 40-50% of acid to become explosive, but 30% solutions appeared safe under static conditions of temperature and concentration.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Avoid reaction with oxidising agents\u00a0</li> </ul>",

Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr).

Toxic doses cause red blood cell lysis, and in consequence, haemoglobinuria and sometimes, kidney damage.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of the glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decrease significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats. This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure. Ethylene glycol ethers and acetates are mainly metabolised to alkoxyacetic acids but there is also a minor pathway through ethylene glycol to oxalic acid. The main pathway of ethylene glycol ethers is associated with significant clinical or experimental health effects, but the minor pathway is also interesting because formation of urinary stones depends principally upon urinary concentration of oxalate and calcium. In one study (1) the tendency to form urinary stones was 2.4 times higher amongst silk-screen printers exposed to ethylene glycol ethers, than among office workers.

Tolerance is reported to be acquired over the workweek and lost during the weekend.</p> <p>Exposure to high concentrations (&gt;1000 ppm) can produce central nervous system depression and narcosis. Lower doses (80-500 ppm) can cause weakness, headache and nausea.</p> <p>Rats, mice, dogs and monkeys that inhaled 100 or 200 ppm MIBK 24 hrs/day showed no outward adverse effects during 2 weeks of exposure. At 200 ppm rats showed increased absolute liver and kidney weights and increased organ-to-body weight ratios. Examination of the proximal tubules showed toxic nephrosis (hyaline droplet degeneration and occasional focal tubular necrosis) in rats exposed to 100 ppm. This damage was considered transient and reversible. Discriminatory behaviour and memory in baboons was effected at exposures of 50 ppm for 7 days.</p> <p>Exposure to ketone vapours may produce nose, throat and mucous membrane irritation. High concentrations of vapour may produce central nervous system depression characterised by headache, vertigo, loss of coordination, narcosis and cardiorespiratory failure. Some ketones produce neurological disorders (polyneuropathy) characterised by bilateral symmetrical paresthesia and muscle weakness primarily in the legs and arms.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>At concentrations of 100-200 ppm MIBK, the vapour may irritate the eyes and respiratory tract</p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause severe eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Experiments with rats exposed to MIBK have shown nerve changes characteristic of neuropathy (disease of the peripheral nerves usually causing weakness and numbness).</p> <p>Chronic occupational exposure to 500 ppm MIBK in air (20-30 mins/day, and 80 ppm for the remainder of the workday resulted in nausea, headache, burning eyes, and weakness in over half the workers. Some workers reported somnolence, insomnia and intestinal pain, and 4/19 appeared to have enlarged livers. This study was continued 5 years after MIBK concentrations had been reduced to 100-105 ppm for the 20-30 minutes exposures and 50 ppm for the general exposure. A few workers still experienced gastrointestinal and neurological problems and slight liver enlargement was found in two individuals.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "AcuteInhaled": "Mice exposed to vapours of cumene showed dilation of cutaneous blood vessels and grades of central nervous system depression, and death, depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. Narcosis was characterised by slow induction and long duration in comparison to that|produced by toluene and benzene.|Daily exposure by rats to 500 ppm for 5 months produced no significant changes in peripheral blood, however hyperaemia and congestion were noted in the lungs, liver and kidneys.|51r37ii<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression.

Calculated lifetimes for the reaction of d-limonene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals range from 0.3-2 h based on experimentally determined rate constants. \u00a0The oxidation of limonene may contribute to aerosol and photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>Calculated lifetimes for the night-time reaction of d-limonene with nitrate radicals range form 0.9 to 9 minutes. \u00a0The daytime atmospheric lifetime of d-limonene is estimated to range from 12 to 48 min. depending upon local hydroxyl rate and ozone concentrations. Products produced from hydroxy radical reaction with limonene are 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene, a keto-aldehyde, formaldehyde, 3-oxobutanal, glyoxal and a C10 dicarbonyl. The same carbonyls, along with formic acid and C8 and C9 carboxylic acids, \u00a0may form in reactions with ozone. Ozonolysis of limonene may also lead to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides, which have various toxic effects on plant cells and may damage forests.</p> <p>Products of ozonolysis include bis(hydroxmethyl)peroxide, a precursor to hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of d-limonene with ozone in the dark results in the formation of 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene and formaldehyde. Reactions with nitrogen oxides produce aerosol formation as well as lower molecular weight products such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone and peroxyacetyl nitrate.</p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>\u00a0When released to the ground limonene is expected to have low to very low mobility in soil based on its physicochemical properties. The soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) calculated on the basis of solubility (13.8 mg/l, 25 C) and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (4.23) ranges from 1030 and 4780. The Henry's law constant indicates that limonene will rapidly volatilise from both dry and moist soil; however its absorption to soil may slow the process.</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate</b>: In the aquatic environment, limonene is expected to evaporate to a significant extent owing \u00a0to its high volatility. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of limonene from a model river ( 1 m deep, flow 1 m/s and wind speed 3 m/s) is 3.4 h. Some limonene is expected to absorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation and bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Limonene does not have functional groups for hydrolysis and its cyclohexene ring and ethylene group are known to resist hydrolysis. Therefore, hydrolysis of limonene is not expected in terrestrial or in aquatic environments. The hydrolytic half-life of d-limonene is estimated to be &gt;1000 days. Biotic degradation of limonene has been shown with some species of microorganisms such as\u00a0<i>Penicillium digitatum, Corynespora cassiicola, Diplodia gossyppina</i>\u00a0and a soil strain of<i>\u00a0Pseudomonans sp (SL strain).\u00a0</i>Limonene is readily biodegradable (41-98% degradation by biological oxygen demand in 14 d) under aerobic conditions in a standard test (OECD 301 C \"Modified MITI Test (1)\", OECD, 1981a; MITI, 1992). Also in a test simulating aerobic sewage treatment (OECD 303 A \"Simulation Test - Aerobic Sewage Treatment: Coupled Units Test\"; OECD, 1981b), limonene disappeared almost completely (&gt;93.8%) during 14 days of incubation.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation has been assessed under anaerobic conditions; there was no indication of any metabolisms, possibly because of the toxicity to micro-organisms.\u00a0</p> <p>The bioconcentration factor, calculated on the basis of water solubility and the log octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Kow) is 246-262, suggesting that limonene may bioaccumulate in fish and other aquatic species.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b>\u00a0Technical limonene is practically nontoxic to birds on a subacute dietary basis, and is slightly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates on an acute basis.\u00a0</p> <p>for d-limonene:</p> <p>LD50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 16 weeks old) oral &gt;2000 mg/kg</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 10 day old) dietary &gt;5620 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Colinus virginianus (Bobwhite quail, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Anas platyrhynchos (Mallard duck, 14 day old) dietary &gt;5000 ppm/8 days</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 80 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 71.4-88.7 ppm); static /92% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout) 568 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 437-852 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>EC50 Daphnia magna (Water flea, &lt;24 hr old; intoxication, immobilization) 17 ppm/48 hr (95% confidence limit: 11-33 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 966 ppm/96 hr (95% confidence limit: 740-1652 ppm); static /4.0% AI formulated product</p> <p>LC50 Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow) 38.5 mg/L/96 hr; flow through /from table/ LC50</p> <p>Leuciscus idus (Golden orfe) 32 mg/L/48 hr /Conditions of bioassay not specified in source examined</p> <p>The acute toxicity of \u00a0d-limonene ranges from slight to high for aquatic organisms.

In its pure form it is not a sensitiser but is irritating to the skin. Although there is clear evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats, the effect has been attributed to an alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G) renal toxicity which is both species and gender specific. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G, and metabolism studies indicate that 75% to 95% of d-limonene is excreted in 2-3 days with different metabolites identified between humans and rats.

Antioxidants can in most cases minimise the oxidation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Fragrance terpenes are generally easily oxidised in air. \u00a0Non-oxidised limonene, linalool and caryophyllene turned out to be very weak sensitizers, however after oxidation limonene hydroperoxide and linalool hydroperoxide are strong sensitizers. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidised limonene, 1.3% to oxidised linalool, 1.1% to linalool hydroperoxide, 0.5% to oxidised caryophyllene, while testing with caryophyllene oxide and oxidised myrcene resulted in few positive patch tests. 2/3 of the patients reacting positive to oxidised terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for adverse reactions to fragrances.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>As well as the hydroperoxides produced by linalol, limonene and delta-3-carene other oxidation and resinification effects progressively causes other fairly major changes in essential oil quality over time. Autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes greatly to fragrance allergy, which emphasizes the need of testing with compounds that patients are actually exposed to and not only with the ingredients originally applied in commercial formulations.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hydroperoxides of d-limonene are potent contact allergens when studied in guinea pigs. They may result when d-limonene is unstabilised against oxidation, or upon prolonged standing at room temperature and/ or upon exposure to light, or when stabiliser levels diminish. The two major hydroperoxides in auto-oxidised d-limonene, \u00a0are cis- and trans- limonene-2-hydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-p-mentha-6,8-diene). In photo-oxidised d-limonene, they represent a minor fraction. Hydroperoxides may bind to proteins of the skin to make antigens either via a radical mechanism or after reactions to give epoxides. The cross-reactivity between the epoxide limonene-1,2-oxide, a potent contact allergen, and the hydroperoxides is NOT significant, indicating different mechanisms of sensitisation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0d-Limonene was considered to be weakly carcinogenic for the mouse fore-stomach epithelium, but not tumour producing. In 13-week and 2-year gavage-studies, male rats showed a range of compound-related kidney lesions including exacerbation of age-related nephropathy, mineralisation in the renal medulla, hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium overlying the renal papilla and proliferation of the renal tubular epithelium. Neoplasms were believed to be caused by progression to tubular cell hyperplasia to tubular cell adenomas and, with increasing size, to adenocarcinomas or carcinomas. The similarity of the nephrotoxicity caused by trichloroethylene and N-(4'-fluoro-4-biphenyl)acetamide, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate in rats and the species specific nature of the response suggests that degeneration and necrosis of convoluted tubules may be associated with the accumulation of alpha-2u-globin (a2u-G). Since a2u-G is a species and gender-specific protein that is causal for both the cytotoxic and carcinogenic response in male rats, extrapolation of d-limonene carcinogenicity data from rat studies to other species (including humans) is probably not warranted. Humans do not synthesise a2u-G; they do however produce other related low molecular weight proteins capable of binding chemicals that cause a2u-G nephropathy in rats but this does not necessarily connote human risk. The Risk Assessment Forum of the USA EPA concluded;</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0Male renal rat tumours arising as a result of a process involving a2u-G accumulation do not contribute to the qualitative weight-of-evidence that the chemical poses a human carcinogenic hazard. Such tumours are included in dose-response extrapolations for the estimation of human carcinogenic risk.\u00a0</li> <li>If the chemical induces a2u-G accumulation in male rats, the associated nephropathy is not to be used as an end-point for determining non-carcinogenic hazard.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Peroxidisable terpenes and terpenoids should only be used when the level of peroxides is kept to the lowest practicable level, for instance by adding antioxidants at the time of production.
