When released into water the material readily evaporates and is biodegradable.</p> <p>Ethanol does not bioaccumulate to an appreciable extent.</p> <p>The material is readily degraded by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxy radicals; release into air will result in photodegradation and wet deposition.</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p>TERRESTRIAL FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of ethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. The potential for volatilisation of ethanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mmHg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for ethanol based on half-lives on the order of a few days for ethanol in sandy soil/groundwater microcosms.</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method, volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 39 days, respectively.An estimated BCF= 3, from a log Kow of -0.31 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in sunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for ethanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse or absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Ethanol was degraded with half-lives on the order of a few days in aquatic studies conducted using microcosms constructed with a low organic sandy soil and groundwater, indicating it is unlikely to be persistent in aquatic environments(8).\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: Ethanol, which has an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase ethanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days, calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-12 m3/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>log Kow: -0.31- -0.32</p> <p>Half-life (hr) air: 144</p> <p>Half-life (hr) H2O surface water: 144</p> <p>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 6.29E-06</p> <p>BOD 5 if unstated: 0.93-1.67,63%</p> <p>COD: 1.99-2.11,97%</p> <p>ThOD: 2.1</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For ethanol:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 49-716 ppm (detection), 101 ppm (recognition)</p> <p>Eye and respiratory tract irritation do not appear to occur at exposure levels of less than 5000 ppm and the TLV-TWA is thought to provide an adequate margin of safety against such effects. Experiments in man show that inhalation of 1000 ppm caused slight symptoms of poisoning and 5000 ppm caused strong stupor and morbid sleepiness. Subjects exposed to 5000 ppm to 10000 ppm experienced smarting of the eyes and nose and coughing. Symptoms disappeared within minutes. Inhalation also causes local irritating effects to the eyes and upper respiratory tract, headaches, sensation of heat intraocular tension, stupor, fatigue and a need to sleep. At 15000 ppm there was continuous lachrymation and coughing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The most common signs of inhalation overexposure to ethanol, in animals, include ataxia, incoordination and drowsiness for those surviving narcosis. The narcotic dose for rats, after 2 hours of exposure, is 19260 ppm.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"X-NONE\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Dusts\r\nwith Minimum Ignition Energies (MIEs) ranging between 10 and 20 mJ are highly\r\nsensitive to ignition.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

In a\r\nwater solution at neutral pH, polyacrylic acid is an anionic polymer, i.e. many\r\nof the side chains of PAA will lose their protons and acquire a negative\r\ncharge. This makes PAAs polyelectrolytes, with the ability to absorb and retain\r\nwater and swell to many times their original volume.

In the dry powder\r\nform, the positively charged sodium ions are bound to the polyacrylate.\r\nHowever, in aqueous solutions the sodium ions are free to move since they are\r\nreplaced by positively charged hydrogen ions.

Sewage sludge\r\nis frequently stabilised by anaerobic digestion and subsequently used as\r\nfertiliser in agriculture. Therefore, degradation and elimination processes in\r\nsewage treatment plants, surface waters and soils are of main interest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Aerobic biodegradability:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Polycarboxylates\r\nare generally not rapidly biodegradable, and no evidence for short-term\r\nbiodegradation has been obtained when polyacrylic acid (P(AA)) 3,000-4,000 MW\r\nwas evaluated for BOD5, BOD10 and DOC removal in test systems inoculated with\r\neffluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant. A respirometric screening\r\ntest with P(AA-MA) 70,000 showed a biodegradability corresponding to &lt; 14%\r\nbiodegradation. A number of 14C-labelled P(AA)1,000; 2,000; 4,500; 10,000 and\r\nP(AA-MA)12,000; 70,000 were tested in flasks fitted with CO2 absorbers. The\r\npolycarboxylates (test concentration: 0.1 and 1 mg/l) were incubated for up to\r\n19 weeks in river water, pre-adapted river water or a mixture of river water\r\nand sediment. Mineralisation in river water was &lt; 20% for all polymers\r\ntested. The P(AA) were mineralised to a higher degree in pre-adapted river\r\nwater and river water plus sediments than in river water alone: 63% and 58% for\r\nP(AA)1,000 and 15% and 12% for P(AA)10,000). The results for P(AA-MA) were not\r\nsignificantly different in the three test waters and indicate that their\r\ndegradation is slow (&lt; 20%) under discontinuous test conditions</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A partial biodegradation of polycarboxylates with a molecular\r\nweight of 1,000-70,000 has been indicated in tests with activated sludge\r\ninoculum. P(AA)1,000 was mineralised to an average extent of 43%, whereas\r\nP(AA)2,000 and P(AA-MA)70,000 were mineralised 19% and 15%, respectively .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The fate of radiolabelled P(AA-MA)70,000 has been examined in a\r\nsewage-treatment plant model system using pre-adapted sewage sludge. Both by\r\ncontinuous and pulse loading more than 90% of the 14C was recovered in the\r\nsludge, while 2-3% remained in the supernatant .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Several studies have shown that the biodegradation of polycarboxylates\r\nin soils is poor. e.g., the 14CO2 production was followed for 1 year in a\r\nstandard soil which was treated with 14C-labelled P(AA-MA)70,000. The total\r\nformation of 14CO2 was 4-7% of the added 14C, and it occurred mainly within the\r\nfirst month .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Anaerobic biodegradability:</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0No\r\nevidence exists for the biodegradation of high molecular weight\r\npolycarboxylates under anoxic conditions.

The most toxic form is when the acid is on alternating carbons of the polymer backbone, with the 96 h EC50 for green algae ranging from 3.13 to 37.4 mg/L with a geometric mean of 8.6 mg/L.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Glycerin alkoxides such as ethoxylated mono and  diglycerides are frequently isolated from this mixture and represent a  separate commercial entity.<br />Ethoxylated glycerides are nonionic  emulsifiers. Ethoxylated glycerides\u00a0 are used as solubilising agents for  essential oils, active ingredients and liposoluble substance. They have  been used in applications as diverse as food processing, textile  applications, fiber finishes, leather processing, metal working,  cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,and as agricultural agents. In addition to  their\u00a0 emulsifying properties for oils, fats and solvents, ethoxylated  triglycerides are widely recognized for their favorable human and  ecotoxicological profiles. They are a preferred choice whenever  sensitive environments must be protected and in cosmetic applications  where they are known to mitigate the irritation potential of more  aggressive surfactants.<br />The water solubility and surfactant  properties of triglycerides (triglycerin esterified with fatty acids)  can be improved by adding ethylene oxide. Vegetable oil ethoxylates  (VOE) are extremely simple to make and consume 100% of the starting  vegetable oil. The resulting product has very low levels of residual EO  and 1,4-dioxane that are typically removed during the drying step. VOEs  can be made in several different ways. At high temperature and alkaline  conditions, triglycerides will hydrolyze to fatty acids and partially  hydrolyzed glycerides. Ethylene oxide reacts with the fatty acids and  hydroxyl groups of the glyceride in a random fashion. The reaction  product is a complex mixture of ethoxylated esters, glycerides, and  polyethylene glycol (PEG). This approach is used to make castor oil  ethoxylates that are used as emulsifiers in cosmetics, textile  processing, and crop protection <br />A second approach is to use ester  insertion catalysts originally developed to ethoxylate methyl esters .  The fatty acids are ethoxylated but still retain their glyceride ester  configuration. The reaction requires high temperature (160-180 deg C)  and exhibits an induction period. The reaction products are dark  coloured, hard waxy solids at room temperature. Soybean oil with 45 mol  of EO (SOE-45) is completely water-soluble The critical micelle  concentration (CMC) of these products is very low with surface tensions  in the high 30 mN/m. Dynamic surface tension is high with relatively  poor wetting kinetics. Interfacial tension against mineral oil is  relatively low and decreases with increasing degree of ethoxylation. The  foam height is about half that of alcohol ethoxylates and increases  with increasing degree of ethoxylation. The water solubility of VOE can  be improved by partially saponifying the ester with sodium hydroxide to  obtain a roughly equal mixture of mono-, di-, and triglyceride  ethoxylates; fatty acid soap; and glycerol ethoxylates. The reaction  mixture shows good surface tension reduction with a low CMC. Microtox  tests and human patch tests show the partially saponified VOEs to be  exceptionally mild and nontoxic.<br />Yet another approach is to react  ethylene oxide with glycerin followed by esterification with fatty acid  or methyl ester to produce polyoxyethylene (ethoxylated) glycerin  esters. In the case of fatty acids, the reaction is run using a strong  acid catalyst, and water of reaction is removed to drive the reaction to  completion. This type of surfactant is widely used in cosmetic products  as a foam boosters, emulsifier, and emollient to help reduce  transdermal water loss. PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate is a well-known example  of this type of surfactant. The wetting properties of ethoxylated  glycerin esters have been determined by cotton disk wetting. The wetting  properties improve with decreasing moles of EO and show synergy with  short-chain alcohol ethoxylates.<br />A similar product is obtained by  transesterifying triglycerides with ethoxylated glycerin using a  conventional base catalyst. The reaction occurs at low temperature (100  deg C) and produces a light colored liquid product after bleaching. VOE  prepared by this reaction are extremely water-soluble and exhibit almost  no gel-phase in water. The reaction product is a complex mixture of  mono-, di-, and triacyl ethoxylated glycerides; glycerin ethoxylate; and  soap. The species distribution can be controlled by changing the ratio  of triglyceride to ethoxylated glycerin used in the reaction. The main  species formed is the monoacyl ethoxylated glyceride\u00a0 The reaction can  be run with any purified triglyceride. The surface properties of  coconut, olive, avocado, and soybean oil ethoxylates show low CMC values  around 10 ppm and surface tension near 30 mN/m. CMC, surface tension,  and foam increase with increasing degree of ethoxylation. Interfacial  tension of soybean oil ethoxylates against mineral oil undergoes a  minimum around 10 mol of EO. Detergency measurements under standard US  wash conditions show optimum cleaning is inversely related to the  interfacial tension.<br />Ethoxylated mono and diglycerides (EMG) are  emulsifiers, produced by an interaction between glycerides and ethylene  oxide. The are some of the oldest and widely used food emulsifiers,  derived from the glycerol found in plant oils and animal fat. Their  dough strengthening properties are exploited in productionof\u00a0 for crusty  breads with a chewy texture. However, they are found in biscuits,  coffee whiteners, ice cream, and salad dressings as well. They also  improve shelf life for baked goods. Their HLB value falls between 9 and  10. EMG typically are sold as glycerin flakes. They must be dissolved in  oil, compared to most ingredients that can be mixed with water. The oil  must be at a temperature above 60 degrees C or 140 degrees F to be  easily mixed in. When used as an emulsifier, 0.5 to 2 percent mono and  diglycerides is best. In bread products, glycerides have strong  hydrophilic surfactant properties and will improve gluten elasticity and  extensibility. They will also produce a greater loaf volume with a  finer crumb.The water solubilization in oil that takes place during  microemulsions decreases with the increasing of ethoxylated content in  mixed surfactants<br />Current United States Environmental Protection  Agency regulations restrict the choices available to agricultural  formulators to a single triglyceride, castor oil, with between 5 and 54  moles of ethoxylation on growing crops, raw agricultural commodities and  animals.</p>",

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>For aliphatic fatty acids and\nalcohols:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental fate:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Saturated fatty acids are very\nstable in air, whereas unsaturated (C=C bonds) fatty acids are susceptible to\noxidation.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Unsaturation increases the rate of\nmetabolism although the degree of unsaturation and positioning of double bonds\nis not highly significant.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>The available data indicate all\nfatty acid salt chain lengths up to and including C18 can be metabolised under\naerobic conditions and can be considered to be readily biodegradable</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>All tests showed that fatty acids\nand lipids are readily biodegradable</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>The  aliphatic acids are of \nsimilar very weak acid strength (approximately  pKa 5), i.e., partially\ndissociate in aqueous solution; the salts of the aliphatic acids are highly\ndissociated in water solution such that the anion is the same for homologous\nsalts and acids.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Slight (although inconsistent)\neffects on the trend for decreasing vapour pressure are also are also observed\nwith the mono-, di-and tri-unsaturated substances as compared to the\ncorresponding saturated substances.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Dicarboxylic  acids: Compared to\ntheir corresponding single acid substances (C8-10 single component, saturated),\nthe dicarboxylic acids exhibit modestly higher melting/ boiling points and\nwater solubility, and lower partition coefficients and  vapour  pressures.

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

Pre-adapted microorganisms can degrade glycerol rapidly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.<br /> Bioaccumulation: Based on Log Kow -1.76, glycerol will have a low bioaccumulation potential and is not expected to bioaccumulate.<br /> Photodegradation: The calculated half-life for the photo-oxidation (reaction with hydroxyl radicals) of glycerol in air is 6.8 hours (EPIWIN vs 3.04).<br /> Stability in Water:\u00a0 Glycerol does not contain functional groups that are expected to react with water.<br /> Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0 From the EQC model (Mackay level III), it can be deduced that 100% of glycerol will end up in the water phase. Negligible amounts will be distributed towards soil, air and sediment<br /> Ecotoxicity:<br /> Fish LC50: &gt;5000 mg/l<br /> Algae IC50: &gt;2900 mg/l<br /> Bacteria EC50: .10000 mg/l (Pseudomonas putida)<br /> The weight of evidence indicates that glycerol is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms and this conclusion is supported by QSAR predictions. The lowest LC50 for fish is a 24-h LC50 of &gt;5000 mg/l for Carassius auratus (Goldfish) and for aquatic invertebrates, a 24 h EC50 of &gt;10000 mg/l for Daphnia magna is the lowest EC50. Several tests on algae are available, which suggest very low toxicity to a range of species, however their validity is uncertain. A QSAR prediction for the 96h EC50 to algae was 78000 mg/l. No toxicity towards the microorganism Pseudomonas putida was observed at 10000 mg/l after exposure for 16 hours. No long-term aquatic toxicity data is available. Screening studies are available on frog and carp embryos which indicate some effects on growth and hatching rates respectively at very high concentrations of glycerol, &gt;7000 mg/l. However, their ecological relevance is not clear.</p><br /> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

OSHA concluded that the nuisance particulate limit would protect the worker form kidney damage and perhaps, testicular effects.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p>",

Lactic acidosis may result.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Propylene glycol is though, by some, to be a sensitising principal following the regular use of topical creams by eczema patients. A study of 866 persons using a formulation containing propylene glycol in a patch test indicated that propylene glycol caused primary irritation in 16% of exposed individuals probably caused by dehydration. Undiluted propylene glycol was tested on 1556 persons in a 24 hour patch test. 12.5% showed reactions which were largely toxic (70%) or allergic in nature (30%). Reaction responses reached their maximum on the second day or later. Reactions were seasonal in nature ranging from 17.8% in winter to 9.2% in other seasons. In a patch-test using 25 standard allergens conducted on 500 individuals, propylene glycol ranked fourth in sensitising response. 84 subjects were patch tested using 100% propylene glycol. as well as 2% and 5% in water. With undiluted material, 15% demonstrated a reaction, with 40% of the reactions being allergic in nature and 60% being irritant. In dilute solutions 5 of 248 subjects exhibited a reaction.</p> <p>Undiluted propylene glycol tested on the skin of man produced no irritation under open conditions but when applied under occlusive conditions, for 2 weeks, it produced severe erythema, oedema and vesicles, probably due to sweat retention and weak primary irritation.</p> <p>Predictive contact skin sensitisation tests indicate that propylene glycol is an intermediate grade sensitiser with an index of 1% of tested subjects.</p> <p>\u00a0Groups of cats fed 5 gm/kg/day of propylene glycol for 14 weeks showed a significant dose-related increase in red blood cell Heinz body formation without any marked signs of haemolytic anaemia. The no-effect-level for cats without formation of Heinz bodies is 100-500 ml/kg. There is no evidence of anaemia or degenerative change. Groups of rats dosed orally with 0.5 or 10 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks had lowered food intake but no adverse effects on body weights. Erythrocytes were more fragile. Heinz bodies were not apparent.</p>",

It is chemically related to imidazolidinyl urea which is used in the same way. Diazolidinyl urea acts as a formaldehyde releaser.|It is used in many cosmetics, skin care products, shampoos and conditioners, as well as a wide range of products including bubble baths, baby wipes and household detergents. Diazolidinyl urea is found in the commercially available preservative Germaben.|Commercial diazolidinyl urea is a mixture of different formaldehyde addition products including polymers|<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazoles have been frequently discovered as a vital component of\r\nnovel and structurally diverse natural products that exhibit a wide variety of\r\nbiological activities. The exceptional range of antitumour, antiviral, and\r\nantibiotic activities, as well as their presence in peptides, or ability to\r\nbind to proteins, DNA, and RNA, has directed numerous synthetic studies and new\r\napplications of these azole heterocycles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While other azole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of\r\nbioactive natural products, the imidazole ring occurs largely in the context of\r\nthe natural amino acid histidine. In addition, the imidazole ring appears as a\r\ncomponent of unnatural cyclic peptides and is used as an ester isostere in\r\npeptidomimetic studies. However, the applications of imidazole are not limited\r\nto the realm of peptides and peptidomimetics. Imidazoles are present in the\r\nlarge family of bromopyrrole-imidazole alkaloids isolated from marine sponges\r\nbased on the common metabolite oroidin that feature significant biological\r\nactivities. The imidazole ring is also present in the pilocarpine alkaloids, as\r\nwell as potential therapeutic agents for thrombosis, cancer, and inflammatory\r\ndiseases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Various compounds that possess an imidazoline or guanidinium\r\nmoiety, along with a number of chemically related compounds, elicit a variety\r\nof pharmacological effects on cardiovascular/cerebrovascular function,\r\nmetabolism, insulin secretion and ion transport. These compounds include the\r\nalpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, mixed alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist/alpha2-adrenoceptor\r\nantagonists and an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist and an ion transport\r\ninhibitor and other structurally related ligands. Although such ligands\r\ninteract with known receptor systems, some of their functional effects, such as\r\ntheir centrally-mediated effects on blood pressure and their ability to augment\r\nglucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, are\r\npharmacologically ill-defined. Indeed, several studies indicate that these\r\nmolecules interact with distinct imidazoline binding sites. These sites share\r\nthe common property of not recognizing endogenous agonists for known monoamine\r\nreceptors and exhibiting high affinity for selected compounds containing an\r\nimidazoline, guanidinium or structurally-related substituent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most bio-active derivatives bear a substituent (aryl or alkyl\r\ngroup) on the carbon between the nitrogen centres.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of substituted imidazoles are selective inhibitors of\r\nnitric oxide synthase, which makes them interesting drug targets in\r\ninflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system.\r\nOther biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the\r\ndownregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with\r\ntranslation initiation</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolines are biologically active pharmacophores and synthetic\r\nintermediates in medicinal chemistry.

These salts have been used as ionic liquids and precursors to stable\r\ncarbenes. Salts where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known;\r\nthese salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate,\r\nNaC3H3N2)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolate (C3H3N-2) is the conjugate base of imidazole. It is a\r\nnucleophile and a strong base. The free anion has C2v symmetry.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Any individual may be predisposed to such antibody mediated reaction if other chemical agents have caused prior sensitisation (cross-sensitivity).</p> <p>\u00a0Chronic exposure to the salicylates (o-hydroxybenzoates) produces a range of effects ranging from metabolic disturbances to kidney and pancreas damage. Hypersensitivity to salicylic acid derivatives have caused reactions which include urticaria and other skin eruptions, rhinitis and severe (even fatal) bronchospasm and dyspnoea.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
