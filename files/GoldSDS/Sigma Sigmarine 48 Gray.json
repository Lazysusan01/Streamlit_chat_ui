The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media.

The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage.

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure. Chronic inhalation in rats by single or\r\nrepeated intratracheal instillation produced a significant increase in the\r\nincidences of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\r\nLifetime inhalation of crystalline silica (87% alpha-quartz) at 1 mg/m3 (74%\r\nrespirable) by rats, produced an increase in animals with keratinising cystic\r\nsquamous cell tumours, adenomas, adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous cell\r\ncarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma and nodular bronchiolar alveolar\r\nhyperplasia accompanied by extensive subpleural and peribronchiolar fibrosis,\r\nincreased pulmonary collagen content, focal lipoproteinosis and macrophage\r\ninfiltration.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The CVD process has found use in the following applications:\nProduction of semiconductor devices \nSynthesis of exotic new powdered/fibrous materials \nFabrication of optical storage media \nProduction of protective coatings, including high temperature-, corrosion-, and wear-resistance coatings \nFormation of ceramic composites, optical fibers and dense structural components. \nThere are a number of CVD forms that include low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD), atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (ACVD), ultrahigh vacuum vapour deposition (UHCVD) and metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). In the case of MOCVD, metal organic species are used as precursors to form thin films of metal oxides, metals, metal nitrides and other kinds of metallic compounds. \nThe ALD process is more popular due to its ability to provide even greater control over the formation of thin films. The unique process has found use in the following applications:\nProduction of new high-k gate dielectrics that hold potential to serve as an alternative to silica in next generation of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors \nDevelopment of electroluminescent device technology \nFabrication of microelectronic devices, including thin-film capacitors, radiation detectors, switches, ferroelectric memories, integrated circuits, and microelectromechanical structures (MEMS). \nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) is a chemically self-limiting deposition technique that is based on the sequential use of a gaseous chemical process. A thin film (as fine as -0.1 Angstrom per cycle) results from repeating the deposition sequence as many times as needed to reach a certain thickness. The major characteristic of the films is the resulting conformality and the controlled deposition manner. Precursor selection is key in ALD processes, namely finding molecules which will have enough reactivity to produce the desired films yet are stable enough to be handled and safely delivered to the reaction chamber.\nProper precursors show promise to develop customised systems for lower-temperature deposition processes, thus preventing the complications related to higher temperatures, including reduced adhesion of mismatching overlayers, interlayer atomic diffusion, and changes in the morphology and crystallinity. Furthermore, they can get rid of halogens, which can be corrosive in the deposition process and even after the formation of the film.\nInitially, metal halides and hydrides were utilised as CVD precursors. Currently, many different metal organic compounds are used as precursors, which include metal carbonyls, metal amidinates, metal diketonates, metal alkoxides, metal alkyls and others.\nMetal Alkoxide Precursors\nMetal alkoxides of copper, silicon, tantalum, vanadium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, and aluminum have been explored as precursors to form oxide thin films using CVD/ALD.\nIn the fabrication of metal oxide thin films utilizing CVD/ALD, a metal organic compound often reacts with H2O2, O3, O2 plasma, or water as the oxygen source. Nonetheless, this approach often involves the formation of interfacial oxide layers between the substrate and the deposited film. On the other hand, in the approach that involves the reaction between metal alkoxides and other metal complexes such as metal chlorides or metal alkyls, the metal alkoxides can serve as the oxygen source as well as the metal. This alternative approach reduces the formation of an undesired interfacial layer as the oxygen is bound to the metal.\nMetal Alkyl Amide Precursors\nMetal alkyl amide precursors include simple amino compounds such as dimethyl- and diethyl- amine and include a large class of compounds but their use in ALD/CVD has been restricted because of their thermal instability.Alkylamides include antimony, aluminium, gallium, germanium, hafnium, niobium, silicon, tantalum, tin, titanium, tungsten, zirconium and yttrium complexes.\nMetal alkyl amides are important as single source CVD precursors for nitride thin films. Basic reagents such as oxygen, water, ozone can react with metal alkyl amides to produce oxide films\nA major driving force for the recent interest is the prospective seen for ALD in scaling down microelectronic devices according to Moore's law. \nALD is considered a subclass of chemical vapour deposition. The majority of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with the surface of a material one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Through the repeated exposure to separate precursors, a thin film is slowly deposited. ALD is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, and part of the set of tools available for the synthesis of nanomaterials. \nIn contrast to chemical vapour deposition, the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but they are inserted as a series of sequential, non-overlapping pulses. In each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a self-limiting way, so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed. Consequently, the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the precursors (a so-called ALD cycle) is determined by the nature of the precursor-surface interaction. By varying the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision on arbitrarily complex and large substrates. <p>Drier.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>metal oxides</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Zirconium is more toxic in soft water than in hard\r\nwater. The toxicity of zirconium salts and zirconium complexes with organic\r\nacids are expected to be related to their water solubilities and their octanol/\r\nwater partition coefficient (Kow). Compounds with molecular weights exceeding\r\n1000 are not expected to be absorbed by aquatic organisms even if they are\r\nwater soluble. Only water-soluble zirconium compounds with a molecular weight\r\nof less than 1000 are expected to be toxic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Zirconium does not bioaccumulate up aquatic\r\nfood chains beyond algae and shellfish. Plants tend to contain far lower\r\nconcentrations of zirconium than the soils in which they are grown, Most\r\nstudies indicate that of the zirconium ingested by mammals little is absorbed\r\nor retained.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><span>For fatty acid salts:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Several tests concerning biodegradation are\r\navailable.

All the evidence points to rapid degradation in\r\nwaste\u2013treatment plants as well.

Beta-oxidation of the parent fatty acid forms\r\nacetate and a new fatty acid of two less carbon atoms. This process repeats\r\nitself until the compound is completely broken down. The hydrocarbon will\r\neventually be degraded to CO2 and H2O. For this reason, the length of the fatty\r\nacid chain does not preclude biodegradation, but it may take longer to achieve\r\ncomplete mineralisation. The beta-oxidation sequence does not necessarily\r\nrequire the presence of molecular oxygen, and fatty acid biodegradation may\r\nproceed under anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Above a certain concentration level these\r\nsoaps will form micelles, which are aggregates of soap molecules into larger,\r\noriented groups.

No\r\nsignificant increase in the micronuclei was observed at doses of 400, 800 or\r\n1,600 mg/kg body weight (Inveresk Research International Ltd, 1994).\r\nFurthermore, <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo </i>genotoxicity data (micronucleus\r\ntest, dominant lethal test) are available for 2-ethylhexanol which is rapidly\r\nand quantitatively converted into 2-EHA in metabolism studies. This data do not\r\nindicate any genotoxic potential which means that such an effect of 2-EHA is\r\nnot likely either. As 2-EHA can induce both DNA synthesis and inhibition of\r\nintercellular communication\u00a0 in hepatic cells, a tumour-promoting potential in\r\nrodents, comparable to that of other peroxisome proliferators, cannot be ruled\r\nout. The carcinogenic effect of peroxisome proliferators in rodents (e.g. of\r\ndi(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, DEHP) is not deemed to be relevant for humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Calcium/zinc and barium/zinc\r\nsalts of 2-EHA are used as thermo-stabilisers for PVC, together with\r\nco-stabilisers like polyols or epoxy compounds, in order to capture the\r\nhydrochloride cleaved during the thermal loading of PVC; in addition various\r\nsalts are used in other food and beverage containers as plasticisers.\u00a0 The\r\nmigration of 2-EHA from the sealing compounds in the metal lids. has been\r\ndemonstrated in food contamination</span><span style=\"color:black\">. </span><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\npotential for human exposure to 2-EHA therefore is significant.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour. A STEL is recommended to prevent mucous membrane and ocular irritation and prevention of acute depression of the central nervous system. Because of the wide variation in molecular weights of its components, the conversion of ppm to mg/m3 is approximate. Sweden recommends hexane type limits of 100 ppm and heptane and octane type limits of 300 ppm. Germany does not assign a value because of the widely differing compositions and resultant differences in toxic properties.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor (OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.042 (gasoline)</p> <p>For white spirit:</p> <p>Low and high odour thresholds of 5.25 and 157.5 mg/m3, respectively, were considered to provide a rather useful index of odour as a warning property.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is calculated from data on the toxicities of the major ingredients and is intended to minimise the potential for irritative and narcotic effects, polyneuropathy and kidney damage produced by vapours.</p> <p>The NIOSH (USA) REL-TWA of 60 ppm is the same for all refined petroleum solvents. NIOSH published an occupational \"action level\" of 350 mg/m3 for exposure to Stoddard solvent, assuming a 10-hour work shift and a 40-hour work-week. The NIOSH-REL ceiling of 1800 mg/m3 was established to protect workers from short-term effects that might produce vertigo or other adverse effects which might increase the risk of occupational accidents. Combined (gross) percutaneous absorption and inhalation exposure (at concentrations associated with nausea) are thought, by some, to be responsible for the development of frank hepatic toxicity and jaundice.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor (OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.042 (white spirit)</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Exposure to white spirit, in a controlled inhalation study using volunteers either at rest or during exercise, (1000 or 2500 mg/m3 for 30 minutes) produced a linear relationship between alveolar and arterial concentrations of the individual solvent components. Pulmonary absorption of the aliphatics ranged from 46-59%, whilst that of aromatic ranged from 58-70%. Although systemic absorption was greater during exercise, the proportion of circulating aliphatic to aromatic components decreased with increased activity. Exposure to 2500 - 5000 mg/m3 produces nausea and vertigo.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience suggests, that the material may cause eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or is expected to produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Petroleum hydrocarbons may produce pain after direct contact with the eyes. Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The vapour when concentrated has pronounced eye irritation effects and this gives some warning of high vapour concentrations. If eye irritation occurs seek to reduce exposure with available control measures, or evacuate area.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis. The material is unlikely to produce an irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives .</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Follicular dermatitis may develop rapidly on repeated immersion of the hands and forearms in white spirits. A Belgian report, produced in 1958, described sub-chronic toxicity amongst workers exposed to white spirit (83% paraffins, 17% aromatics) over a 4 month period. These workers complained of nausea and vomiting and one developed aplastic anaemia; bone marrow depression was confirmed. This employee died several months later as a result of septicaemia. \u00a0Bone marrow depression, associated with human exposure, might be explained by the presence of myelotoxic compounds, the most notable being benzene.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>A significant number of individuals exposed to mixed trimethylbenzenes complained of nervousness, tension, anxiety and asthmatic bronchitis. Peripheral blood showed a tendency to hypochromic anaemia and a deviation from normal in coagulability of the blood. Hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from 10 to 60 ppm. Contamination of the mixture with benzene may have been responsible for the blood dyscrasias.</p> <p>High concentrations of mesitylene vapour (5000 to 9000 ppm) caused central nervous system depression in mice. Similar exposures of pseudocumene also produced evidence of CNS involvement.</p>",

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Exposure to doses sufficiently high to produce intoxication and unconsciousness also produces transient liver and kidney toxicity. Neurologic impairment is NOT evident amongst volunteers inhaling up to 400 ppm though complaints of ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation occur at 200 ppm for 3 to 5 minutes.</p> <p>Exposure to xylene at or below the recommended TLV-TWA and STEL is thought to minimise the risk of irritant effects and to produce neither significant narcosis or chronic injury.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination). Although toluene/ethanol interactions are well recognised, the degree of protection afforded by the TLV-TWA among drinkers is not known.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor(OSF)</p> <p>OSF=17 (TOLUENE)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin. Absorption by skin may readily exceed vapour inhalation exposure. Symptoms for skin absorption are the same as for inhalation. Contact with eyes and mucous membranes may also contribute to overall exposure and may also invalidate the exposure standard.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

In 96-hr algal toxicity testing, results indicate that ethylbenzene inhibits algae growth in\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornatum\u00a0</i>at 3.6 mg/L and in\u00a0<i>Skeletonema costatum\u00a0</i>at 7.7 mg/L.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic).

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",
