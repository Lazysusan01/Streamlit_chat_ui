Hydrolysis of geranyl acetate and neryl acetate is expected both\u00a0<i>in\u00a0</i>vivo and in the environment. The second major constituent of acetylated myrcene, limen, will not hydrolyse in water. The significance of calculated half-life data for geranyl acetate must take into account the experimental data that aliphatic ester, in general, are readily hydrolysed in fish.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Duplicate studies on citronellol and geraniol show these materials to be readily biodegradable (<i>i.e.,\u00a0</i>100% biodegradation [OECD 301B, OECD 301C]. Likewise, a mixture of geranial and neral (citral) exhibits greater than 92% \u00a0and 99.5% biodegradation. Nerol is a stereoisomer of geraniol and would likewise be expected to be readily biodegradable. Geranyl acetate has also been shown to be readily biodegradable (greater than 82% biodegradation) and, therefore, neryl acetate would be as well. The other significant constituent of acetylated myrcene, limen, has not been shown to be readily biodegradable. However, since limen makes up only 10% of the mixture, a ready biodegradation test of the mixture is expected to result in apparent ready biodegradation.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>Terpenes and their oxygen-containing counterparts, the terpenoids, produce a variety of physiological effects. Pine oil monoterpenes, for example, produce a haemorrhagic gastritis characterised by stomach pain and bleeding and vomiting. \u00a0Systemic effects of pine oils include weakness and central nervous depression, excitement, loss of balance, headache, with hypothermia and respiratory failure.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>|Vomiting, shock, cyanosis and convulsions preceded death in a child who consumed an unknown quantity of a preparation consisting mainly of &quot;oil of citronella&quot;. Gastric mucosa was found to be severely damaged. By stomach tube citronellol produced paralysis, coma, death in doses of|about 1-4 ml/kg in rabbits.",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

These symptoms may be treated with steroid creams, although frequent recourse to this treatment produces unwanted side-effects.</p> <p>Intolerance to perfumes, by inhalation, may occur if the perfume contains a sensitising principal. Symptoms may vary from general illness, coughing, phlegm, wheezing, chest-tightness, headache, exertional dyspnoea, acute respiratory illness, hayfever, and other respiratory diseases (including asthma). Perfumes can induce hyper-reactivity of the respiratory tract without producing an IgE-mediated allergy or demonstrable respiratory obstruction. This was shown by placebo-controlled challenges of nine patients to \"perfume mix\". The same patients were also subject to perfume provocation, with or without a carbon filter mask, to ascertain whether breathing through a filter with active carbon would prevent symptoms. The patients breathed through the mouth, during the provocations, as a nose clamp was used to prevent nasal inhalation. The patient's earlier symptoms were verified; breathing through the carbon filter had no protective effect. The symptoms were not transmitted via the olfactory nerve but they may have been induced by trigeminal reflex via the respiratory tract or by the eyes.</p> <p>Cases of occupational asthma induced by perfume substances such as isoamyl acetate, limonene, cinnamaldehyde and benzaldehyde, tend to give persistent symptoms even though the exposure is below occupational exposure limits.</p> <p>Inhalation intolerance has also been produced in animals. The emissions of five fragrance products, for one hour, produced various combinations of sensory irritation, pulmonary irritation, decreases in expiratory airflow velocity as well as alterations of the functional observational battery indicative of neurotoxicity in mice. Neurotoxicity was found to be more severe after mice were repeatedly exposed to the fragrance products, being four brands of cologne and one brand of toilet water.</p>",
