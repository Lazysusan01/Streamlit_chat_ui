It is not readily\r\nbiodegradable, and it can take months or longer to degrade in surface waters,\r\nsoils, and sediments. Nonbiological degradation is negligible. Many products\r\nthat contain nonylphenol have \"down-the-drain\" applications, such as laundry\r\nand dish soap, so the contaminants are frequently introduced into the water\r\nsupply. In sewage treatment plants, nonylphenol ethoxylate degrades into\r\nnonylphenol, which is found in river water and sediments as well as soil and\r\ngroundwater. Nonylphenol photodegrades in sunlight, but its half-life in\r\nsediment is estimated to be more than 60 years. Although the concentration of\r\nnonylphenol in the environment is decreasing, it is still found at\r\nconcentrations of 4.1 \u00b5g/L in river waters and 1 mg/kg in sediments. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A major concern is that\r\ncontaminated sewage sludge is frequently recycled onto agricultural land. The\r\ndegradation of nonylphenol in soil depends on oxygen availability and other\r\ncomponents in the soil. Mobility of nonylphenol in soil is low.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation is significant in\r\nwater-dwelling organisms and birds, and nonylphenol has been found in internal\r\norgans of certain animals at concentrations of 10 to 1,000 times greater than\r\nthe surrounding environment. Due to this bioaccumulation and persistence of nonylphenol,\r\nit has been suggested that nonylphenol could be transported over long distances\r\nand have a global reach that stretches far from the site of contamination.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenol is not persistent in\r\nair, as it is rapidly degraded by hydroxyl radicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Nonylphenol is considered to be\r\nan endocrine disruptor due to its ability to mimic estrogen and in turn disrupt\r\nthe natural balance of hormones in affected organisms.The effect is weak\r\nbecause nonylphenols are not very close structural mimics of estradiol, but the\r\nlevels of nonylphenol can be sufficiently high to compensate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The effects of nonylphenol in the\r\nenvironment are most applicable to aquatic species. Nonylphenol can cause\r\nendocrine disruption in fish by interacting with estrogen receptors and\r\nandrogen receptors. Studies report that nonylphenol competitively displaces\r\nestrogen from its receptor site in rainbow trout. It has a stronger affinity to\r\nthe E2 receptor than estrogen. Nonylphenol causes the feminization of aquatic\r\norganisms, decreases male fertility, and decreases survival in young fish.\r\nStudies show that male fish exposed to nonylphenol have lower testicular\r\nweight. Nonylphenol can disrupt steroidogenesis in the liver. One function of\r\nendogenous estrogen in fish is to stimulate the liver to make vitellogenin,\r\nwhich is a phospholipoprotein. Vitellogenin is released by the maturing female\r\nand sequestered by developing oocytes to produce the egg yolk. Males do not\r\nnormally produce vitellogenin, but when exposed to nonylphenol they produce similar\r\nlevels of vitellogenin to females. The concentration needed to induce\r\nvitellogenin production in fish is 10 ug/L for NP in water. Nonylphenol can\r\nalso interfere with the level of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) being\r\nreleased from the pituitary gland. Concentrations of NP that inhibit\r\nreproductive development and function in fish also damages kidneys, decreases\r\nbody weight, and induces stressed behavior.</span></p> <p>Surfactants are in general toxic to aquatic organisms due to their surface-active properties. Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>for alkylphenols:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The alkylphenolics may be divided into three groups.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Group I: ortho-substituted mono-alkylphenols:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Group II para-substituted mono-alkylphenols</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Group III: di- and tri-substituted mixed alkyl phenols</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>All the phenols have a single, common functional group the\r\nphenolic hydroxyl.

The European Union has also included NP on the\r\nlist of priority hazardous substances for surface water in the Water Framework\r\nDirective.

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>Environmental toxicity is a function of the n-octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Pow, log Kow).

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Inhalation of quantities of liquid mist may be extremely hazardous, even lethal due to spasm, extreme irritation of larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Pulmonary absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Inhalation of phenol and some of its derivatives may produce profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis, hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hyperpnoea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema with pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Phenols may exhibit local anaesthetic properties and, in general, are central nervous system depressants at high concentrations. The dihydroxy derivatives act as simple phenols but their effects are largely limited to local irritation. Trihydroxy derivatives may reduce the oxygen content of blood at sufficient exposure levels. Methyl phenols (cresols) typically do not pose significant inhalation hazards due to relatively low vapour pressures and objectionable odours. Substituted phenols produce similar effects to phenol although such effects may only be evident at high levels of exposure. Alkyl substitution tends to increase toxicity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Irritation of the eyes may produce a heavy secretion of tears (lachrymation).</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Some nonionic surfactants may produce a localised anaesthetic effect on the cornea; this may effectively eliminate the warning discomfort produced by other substances and lead to corneal injury. Irritant effects range from minimal to severe dependent on the nature of the surfactant, its concentration and the duration of contact. Pain and corneal damage represent the most severe manifestation of irritation.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Some phenol derivatives may produce mild to severe eye irritation with redness, pain and blurred vision. Permanent eye injury may occur; recovery may also be complete or partial.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Phenol and some of its derivatives may produce mild to severe skin irritation on repeated or prolonged contact, producing second and third degree chemical burns. Rapid cutaneous absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Absorption through the skin may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hyperpnoea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Nonionic surfactants may produce localised irritation of the oral or gastrointestinal mucosa and induce vomiting and mild diarrhoea.</p> <p>Some phenol derivatives may produce mild to severe damage within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hypernea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Severe phenol ingestions cause hypotension, coma, ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures and white coagulative chemical burns.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Phenol does not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation like dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol and thus does not cause a heat exhaustion-like syndrome. Phenolic groups with ortho and para positions free from substitution are reactive; this is because the ortho and para positions on the aromatic ring are highly activated by the phenolic hydroxyl group and are therefore readily substituted.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>There is sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between human exposure to the material and impaired fertility</p><p>There is sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between human exposure to the material and subsequent developmental toxic effects in the off-spring.</p><p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>The alkyl phenolics (which may occur as breakdown products of some polyethoxylated surfactants) have been implicated in a phenomenon which has apparently occurred since the mid 1960s, namely lower sperm counts and reduced fertility in males. Nonyl phenol acts like an oestrogen hormone which stimulates breast cells to divide in vitro. When pregnant rats are fed nonylphenols at doses comparable to that at which humans might be exposed, male offspring had significantly smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. Although the human foetus is \"bathed\" in naturally occurring oestrogens during pregnancy it is suggested that it has developed a protective mechanism against natural oestrogens but is not safe from synthetic variants. These tend to accumulate in body fats which sets them apart from the natural product. During early pregnancy, fats are broken down and may flood the body with concentrated pollutants. Drinking water may be one source of exposure to alkyl phenols as many polyethoxylated surfactants are discharged to water treatment systems where they undergo degradation.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p> <p>Prolonged exposure to some derivatives of phenol may produce dermatitis, anorexia, weight loss, weakness, muscle aches and pain, liver damage, dark urine, ochronosis, skin eruptions, diarrhoea, nervous disorders with headache, salivation, fainting, increased skin and scleral pigmentation, vertigo and mental disorders. Liver and kidney damage may also ensue. Chronic phenol toxicity was first noted in medical personnel in the late 1800s when 5 and 10% phenol was used as a skin disinfectant. The term carbolic (phenol) marasmus was given to this syndrome.</p> <p>\u00a0Addition of structurally related phenolic compounds to the diet of Syrian golden hamsters induced forestomach hyperplasia and tumours. These compounds included 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxphenol (BHA) (CAS RN: 25013-16-5), 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TBMP) (29759-28-2) and p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) (98-54-4); less active were catechol (154-23-4), p-methylphenol (331-39-5), methylhydroquinone (MHQ) (95-71-6) and pyrogallol (87-66-1), whilst no activity was seen with resorcinol (108-46-3), hydroquinone (123-31-9), propylparaben (94-13-3) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (1948-33-0).</p> <p>\u00a0In autoradiographic studies, intake of BHA, TBMP, catechol, PMOP, PTBP and MHQ resulted in a significant increase in the labelling index of the forestomach epithelium, whilst PMOP induced epithelial damage and pyloric regenerative hyperplasia. Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). A further as yet unexplored mechanism may involve substitution by titanium for several metals (such as vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc) which perform essential biologic functions; all have a similar atomic radius</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

Indeed, once\r\nreleased and dissolved into the environment no distinction can be made between\r\nthe initial forms of silica. At normal environmental pH, dissolved silica\r\nexists exclusively as monosilicic acid [Si(OH)4]. At pH 9.4 the solubility of\r\namorphous silica is about 120 mg SiO2/l . Quartz has a solubility of only 6\r\nmg/l, but its rate of dissolution is so slow at ordinary temperature and\r\npressure that the solubility of amorphous silica represents the upper limit of\r\ndissolved silica concentration in natural waters.

After these organisms\r\ndie, the biogenic silica accumulated in them partly dissolves. The portion of\r\nthe biogenic silica that does not dissolve settles and ultimately reaches the\r\nsediment. The transformation of opal (amorphous biogenic silica) deposits in\r\nsediments through diagenetic processes allows silica to re-enter the geological\r\ncycle.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

It differs greatly from classical silicosis both clinically and pathologically. The disease is rapidly progressive with diffuse pulmonary involvement developing only months after the initial exposure and causing deaths within 1 to 2 years. It is often complicated by an associated tuberculosis. The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage. This causes the macrophage to be digested by its own enzymes and after lysis the free silica is released to be ingested by other macrophages thus continuing initiate collagen formation in the lung tissue producing the characteristic nodule found in classical (chronic) silicosis.</p>",

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media.

The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>aldehydes</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

A number of BPA-degrading bacteria have been\r\nisolated from enrichments of sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The first\r\nstep in the biodegradation of BPA is the hydroxylation of the carbon atom of a\r\nmethyl group or the quaternary carbon in the BPA molecule.

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>All glycidyl ethers show genotoxic potential due their alkylating  properties. Those glycidyl ethers that have been investigated in long  term studies exhibit more or less marked carcinogenic potential.  Alkylating agents may damage the stem cell which acts as the precursor  to components of the blood. Loss of the stem cell may result in  pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells and  platelets) with a latency period corresponding to the lifetime of the  individual blood cells. Granulocytopenia (a reduction in granular  leukocytes) develops within days and thrombocytopenia (a disorder  involving platelets), within 1-2 weeks, whilst loss of erythrocytes (red  blood cells) need months to become clinically manifest. Aplastic  anaemia develops due to complete destruction of the stem cells.<br />Reported  adverse effects in laboratory animals include sensitization, and skin  and eye irritation, as well as mutagenic and tumorigenic activity..<br />Testicular  abnormalities (including testicular atrophy with decreased  spermatogenic activity) following exposure to glycidyl ethers\u00a0 have been  reported. Haemopoietic abnormalities following exposure to glycidyl  ethers, including alteration of the leukocyte count, atrophy of lymphoid  tissue, and bone marrow cytotoxicity have also been reported. These  abnormalities were usually observed along with pneumonia and/or toxemia,  and therefore may be secondary effects. However, especially in light of  the generalized reduction in leukocytes and the atrophy of lymphoid  tissues, the observed haemopoietic abnormalities may have been  predisposing factors to pneumonia. While none of the individual research  reports are conclusive with respect to the ability of glycidyl ethers  to produce permanent changes to the testes or haemopoietic system in  laboratory animals, the pattern of displayed effects is reason for  concern<br />Glycidyl ethers have been shown to cause allergic contact  dermatitis in humans. Glycidyl ethers generally cause skin sensitization  in experimental animals. Necrosis of the mucous membranes of the nasal  cavities was induced in mice exposed to allyl glycidyl ether. \u00a0<br />A  study of workers with mixed exposures was inconclusive with regard to  the effects of specific glycidyl ethers. Phenyl glycidyl ether, but not  n-butyl glycidyl ether, induced morphological transformation in  mammalian cells in vitro. n-Butyl glycidyl ether induced micronuclei in  mice in vivo following intraperitoneal but not oral administration.  Phenyl glycidyl ether did not induce micronuclei or chromosomal  aberrations in vivo or chromosomal aberrations in animal cells in vitro.  Alkyl C12 or C14 glycidyl ether did not induce DNA damage in cultured  human cells or mutation in cultured animal cells. Allyl glycidyl ether  induced mutation in Drosophila. The glycidyl ethers were generally  mutagenic to bacteria.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Bisphenol A exhibits hormone-like\r\nproperties that raise concern about its suitability in consumer products and\r\nfood containers.\u00a0 Bisphenol A is thought to be an endocrine disruptor which can\r\nmimic oestrogen and may lead to negative health effects. More specifically,\r\nbisphenol A closely mimics the structure and function of the hormone oestradiol\r\nwith the ability to bind to and activate the same oestrogen receptor as the\r\nnatural hormone. The presence of the p-hydroxy group on the benzene rings is\r\nthough to be responsible for the oestradiol mimicry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">. Early developmental stages\r\nappear to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects and some studies\r\nhave linked prenatal exposure to later physical and neurological difficulties.\r\nRegulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety\r\nlevels are being questioned or are under review. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A 2009 study on Chinese workers\r\nin bisphenol A factories found that workers were four times more likely to\r\nreport erectile dysfunction, reduced sexual desire and overall dissatisfaction\r\nwith their sex life than workers with no heightened bisphenol A exposure.\r\nBisphenol A workers were also seven times more likely to have ejaculation\r\ndifficulties. They were also more likely to report reduced sexual function\r\nwithin one year of beginning employment at the factory, and the higher the\r\nexposure, the more likely they were to have sexual difficulties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bisphenol A in weak\r\nconcentrations is sufficient to produce a negative reaction on the human\r\ntesticle. The researchers found that a concentration equal to 2 ug/ litre of\r\nbisphenol A in the culture medium, a concentration equal to the average\r\nconcentration generally found in the blood, urine and amniotic fluid of the\r\npopulation, was sufficient to produce the effects. The researchers believe that\r\nexposure of pregnant women to bisphenol A may be one of the causes of\r\ncongenital masculinisation defects of the hypospadia and cryptorchidism types\r\nthe frequency of which has doubled overall since the 70's. They also suggested\r\nthat \"it is also possible that bisphenol A contributes to a reduction in\r\nthe production of sperm and the increase in the incidence of testicular cancer\r\nin adults that have been observed in recent decades\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One review has concluded that\r\nobesity may be increased as a function of bisphenol A exposure, which\r\n\"...merits concern among scientists and public health officials\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">One study demonstrated that\r\nadverse neurological effects occur in non-human primates regularly exposed to\r\nbisphenol A at levels equal to the United States Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA) maximum safe dose of 50 ug/kg/day This research found a\r\nconnection between bisphenol A and interference with brain cell connections\r\nvital to memory, learning, and mood.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A further review concluded that\r\nbisphenol-A has been shown to bind to thyroid hormone receptor and perhaps have\r\nselective effects on its functions. Carcinogenicity studies have shown\r\nincreases in leukaemia and testicular interstitial cell tumours in male rats.\r\nHowever, \"these studies have not been considered as convincing evidence of\r\na potential cancer risk because of the doubtful statistical significance of the\r\nsmall differences in incidences from controls\". Another in vitro study has\r\nconcluded that bisphenol A is able to induce neoplastic transformation in human\r\nbreast epithelial cells.[whilst a further study concluded that maternal oral\r\nexposure to low concentrations of bisphenol A, during lactation, increases\r\nmammary carcinogenesis in a rodent model. In vitro studies have suggested that\r\nbisphenol A can promote the growth of neuroblastoma cells and potently promotes\r\ninvasion and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells. Newborn rats exposed to a\r\nlow-dose of bisphenol A (10 ug/kg) showed increased prostate cancer susceptibility\r\nwhen adults. At least one study has suggested that bisphenol A suppresses DNA\r\nmethylation which is involved in epigenetic changes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bisphenol A is the isopropyl\r\nadduct of 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl oxide (DHDPO). A series of DHDPO analogues\r\nhave been investigated as potential oestrogen receptor/anti-tumour drug\r\ncarriers in the development of a class of therapeutic drugs called\r\n\"cytostatic hormones\". Oestrogenic activity is induced with 1 to 100\r\nmg/kg body weight in animal models. Bisphenol A sealants are frequently used in\r\ndentistry for treatment of dental pits and fissures. Samples of saliva\r\ncollected from dental patients during a 1-hour period following application\r\ncontain the monomer. A bisphenol-A sealant has been shown to be oestrogenic in\r\nvitro; such sealants may represent an additional source of xenoestrogens in\r\nhumans and may be the cause of additional concerns in children.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Concerns have been raised about\r\nthe possible developmental effects on the foetus/embryo or neonate resulting\r\nfrom the leaching of bisphenol A from epoxy linings in metal cans which come in\r\ncontact with food-stuffs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Many drugs, including naproxen,\r\nsalicylic acid, carbamazepine and mefenamic acid can, in vitro, significantly\r\ninhibit bisphenol A glucuronidation (detoxification).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">BPA belongs to the list of\r\ncompounds having this property as the rodent models have shown that BPA\r\nexposure is linked with increased body weigh (obesogens)t. Several mechanisms\r\ncan help explain the effect of BPA on body weight increase.\u00a0 A possible\u00a0 mechanism\r\nleading to triglyceride accumulation is the decreased production of the hormone\r\nadiponectin from all human adipose tissue tested when exposed to very low\r\nlevels (below nanomolar range) of BPA in cell or explant culture settings . The\r\nexpression of leptin as well as several enzymes and transcription factors is\r\nalso affected by BPA exposure in vivo as well as in vitro. Together, the\r\naltered expression and activity of these important mediators of fat metabolism\r\ncould explain the increase in weight following BPA exposure in rodent models.\r\nThese results also suggest that, together with other obesogens, low,\r\nenvironmentally relevant levels of BPA may contribute to the human obesity\r\nphenomenon.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers\r\n(BADGEs) produce sensitisation dermatitis characterised by a papular, vesicular\r\neczema with considerable itching of the back of the hand, the forearm and face\r\nand neck.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Exposure to doses sufficiently high to produce intoxication and unconsciousness also produces transient liver and kidney toxicity.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard.

In addition the US EPA's procedures for risk assessment for hazard identification and dose-response assessment as applied by NIOSH were used in the creation of such limits.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

In 96-hr algal toxicity testing, results indicate that ethylbenzene inhibits algae growth in\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornatum\u00a0</i>at 3.6 mg/L and in\u00a0<i>Skeletonema costatum\u00a0</i>at 7.7 mg/L.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic).

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Isobutanol appears to be more toxic than n-butyl alcohol.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Most liquid alcohols appear to act as primary skin irritants in humans.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>Following a single dose of isobutanol in rats, deaths were delayed for several days and hepatic degeneration was evident.</p>",
