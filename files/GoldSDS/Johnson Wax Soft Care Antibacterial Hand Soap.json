Some triclosan is also likely to end up in river sediments. There are limited data to suggest that triclosan may be persistent in sediments. The toxicity of triclosan to sediment dwelling organisms is unknown.</p> <p>A transformation product of triclosan, methyl triclosan, has been subject to a number of investigations Methyl triclosan can be formed either during the sewage treatment process or in the natural environment. It is typically present at much lower concentrations than triclosan but it is potentially of concern as it is not broken down by sunlight and is therefore more stable than triclosan. It has also been found to bio-accumulate in fish \u00a0Presently there is very little data available on the toxicity of methyl triclosan, so its risk to aquatic life remains uncertain.</p> <p>Other reported transformation products of triclosan which may be a concern for the environment include 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, formed under laboratory conditions using light (photolysis) However the extent to which this takes process takes place in the natural environment is unknown and therefore it is difficult to assess the environmental significance.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>Because of the antibacterial effect of triclosan, degradation tests according to OECD 301 (\"ready degradability\") are not relevant. Thus, data from MITI reporting 0% degradability at a concentration of 100 mg/ml is not valid. Ciba reports results from inherent tests demonstrating degradation, but the removal of triclosan in these studies may be a result of adsorption to sludge. So far, there are no available data to document ready degradability. Based on the insufficient data on degradation, a classification of \"not readily biodegradable\" by default is proposed.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>Triclosan has a log Kow of 4.76, which indicate a high potential for bioaccumulation (molecular weight &lt; 700). Data from Ciba reports BCF-values of 4160 (3 ppb) and 2530 (30 ppb) on Zebra fish (OECD 305C) with 5 weeks exposure. Ciba reports 98% depuration within 2 weeks; most of the triclosan taken up by the fish during the exposure time was excreted.</p> <p>In another study Another study BCF-values in the range of 3730-8400, at various pH-values, have been reported. This study is according to OECD 305, and valid as a study to document a high potential of bioaccumulation</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The impact of triclosan on the aquatic environment depends on its aquatic toxicity and potential bioaccumulation and degradation properties. Work done at the Institute of Applied Environmental Research (ITM) in Sweden has shown that triclosan is bioavailable to fish in the aquatic environment downstream of municipal treatment works, and it has been found in human breast milk.</p> <p>The possible harmful effects of wide-ranging use of antibacterial substances like triclosan are not known well enough. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of bacterial strains to evolve resistance to triclosan and other antibiotics. Moreover, ecotoxicological studies demonstrate that triclosan is very toxic to aquatic organisms and has high potential for bioaccumulation.\u00a0</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): 0.26 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): zebra Fish LC50: 0.5 mg/l\u00a0</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 (48 h): \u00a00.4 mg/l \u00a0OECD 202</p> <p>Daphnia magna L(E)C50 48 h): 0.39 mg/l</p> <p>Algea EC50 (72 h): \u00a00.2 mg/l 72h OECD 201</p> <p>Algae L(E)C50 (72 h): Scenedesmus sub.0.0014 mg/l; \u00a0Anabena flos-acuae 0.000966 mg/l</p> <p>C. dubia (crustacean) L(E)C50 (48 h): 0.13 mg/l</p> <p>Toxicity to bacteria: 20 mg/l (3h) OECD 209</p> <p>Test results from studies with fresh water algae reported to the US EPA for the notification of triclosan (US EPA report NTIS/OTS0573798), demonstrate L(E)C50 values of 0.966 ug/l and 4.46 ug/l..</p> <p>The US EPA studies are performed according to standard methods of EPA and ASTM, except that the algae growth are not measured each day during the exposure period of 4 days, but only at the start and the end. \u00a0The EC50 value is calculated from the cell density after 96 hours growth.\u00a0</p> <p>According to the evaluation of these studies by The Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), the ca 300x increased cell density of the control (growth rate 1.42d exp-1) within 96 h, indicate an exponential growth during most of the incubation period the\u00a0<i>Selenastrum</i>\u00a0study. Thus, the reported EC50 value (4.46 ug/l) corresponds to EbC50 as defined in the OECD Guideline 201. Although the exposure time of 96 hours in the study is longer than the recommended time of 72 hours in the OECD Guideline, the 72h EbC50 will probably not exceed a factor of 2 compared to the 96h EbC50. Based on raw data from the study, the 96h ErC50 (inhibition of growth rate) is calculated to 15.7 ug/l. The EfC50 do not depend on the exposure time like the EbC50</p> <p>The evaluation of the\u00a0<i>Selenastrum</i>\u00a0study thus concludes that the study is valid to document EC50 &lt;&lt; 1mg/l for algae.</p> <p>Most PCBs are volatile enough to cycle between the air, water, and soil at environmental temperatures, and that atmospheric transport is the most important mechanism for the global movement of PCBs.</p> <p>PCBs are globally circulated and are present in all environmental media. Atmospheric transport is the most important mechanism for global dispersion of PCBs. Biphenyls with 0-1 chlorine atoms remain in the atmosphere, those with 1-4 chlorines gradually migrate toward polar latitudes in a series of volatilisation/deposition cycles, those with 4-8 chlorines remain in mid-latitudes, and those with 8-9 chlorines remain close to the source of contamination. PCBs enter the atmosphere from volatilisation from both soil and water surfaces. Once in the atmosphere, PCBs are present in both the vapor phase and sorbed to particles. PCBs in the vapor phase appear to be more mobile and transported further than particle-bound PCBs. Wet and dry deposition remove PCBs from the atmosphere. The dominant source of PCBs to surface waters is atmospheric deposition; however, redissolution of sediment-bound PCBs also accounts for water concentrations. PCBs in water are transported by diffusion and currents. PCBs are removed from the water column by sorption to suspended solids and sediments as well as from volatilisation from water surfaces. Higher chlorinated congeners are more likely to sorb, while lower chlorinated congeners are more likely to volatilize. PCBs also leave the water column by concentrating in biota. PCBs accumulate more in higher trophic levels through the consumption of contaminated food, a \u00a0strong binding to soil. Volatilisation from soil appears to be an important loss mechanism; it is more important for the lower chlorinated congeners than for the higher chlorinated congeners. Vapor-phase PCBs accumulate in the aerial parts of terrestrial vegetation and food crops by vapor-to-plant transfer.</p> <p>PCBs are strongly sorbed to soils as a result of low water solubility and high Kow, and will not leach extensively The tendency to leach will be greatest among the least chlorinated congeners and is expected to be greatest in soil with low organic carbon. The mechanisms involved in the soil-to-air transfer of PCBs will involve a combination of direct soil organic matter-to-air transfer and soil pore water-to-air transfer. Volatilisation rates are greatest in moist soils from the co-vaporisation of PCBs and water.</p> <p>The ability of PCBs to be degraded or transformed in the environment depends on the degree of chlorination of the biphenyl molecule as well as on the isomeric substitution pattern. The vapor-phase reaction of PCBs with hydroxyl radicals is the dominant transformation process in the atmosphere, while photolysis appears to be the only viable abiotic degradation process in water. Biodegradation in the environment, although slow, occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In sediments, aside from the aerobic surface layer, anaerobic microbial degradation will be primarily responsible for transformation, particularly of the more highly chlorinated congeners. Aerobic biodegradation in soil, surface water, and sediments is limited to the less chlorinated congeners.</p> <p>\u00a0In the atmosphere, the vapor-phase reaction of PCBs with hydroxyl radicals (photochemically formed by sunlight) is the dominant transformation process. The calculated tropospheric lifetime values for this reaction increases as the number of chlorine substitutions increases. The tropospheric lifetime values (determined using the calculated OH radical reaction rate constant and assuming an annual diurnally averaged OH radical concentration of 5x105 molecule/cm3) are: 5-11 days for monochlorobiphenyls, 8-17 days for dichlorobiphenyls, 14-30 days for trichlorobiphenyls, 25-60 days for tetrachlorobiphenyls, and 60-120 days for pentachlorobiphenyls.</p> <p>Experiments with both pure and mixed microbial cultures show that some congeners of PCBs, usually containing from one to four chlorine substituents, are readily biodegraded aerobically although biodegradation of congeners containing up to six or seven chlorine atoms has been shown under enrichment conditions. The most common process for the aerobic degradation of PCBs by bacterial cultures proceeds in two distinct steps: first bioconversion to the corresponding chlorinated benzoic acid and secondly, mineralization of the chlorobenzoate to carbon dioxide and inorganic chlorides.</p> <p>\u00a0PCBs and other polyhalogenated polyaromatic hydrocarbons (including the dioxins and brominated species) are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and because of their solubility in fats and oils they tend to be bioconcentrated in living organisms. The highly chlorinated PCBs are retained in animals longer and seem to delay the excretion of the lower chlorinated PCBs. This is presumably true of other halogenated species and halogenated polyaromatic systems. They have become widely dispersed in the world environment and in the food-chain since their introduction. They are now recognised internationally to be a major environmental pollutant, their persistence causing ecological damage via water pollution. Consequently the loss of these materials to the environment is to be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>\u00a0PCBs are exceptionally persistent in the food chain, some even more so than the organochlorine insecticides with which they are often confused. In general the higher the degree of chlorination, the more resistant to degradation and more persistent environmentally they become.</p> <p>\u00a0Bioconcentration factors of PCBs in aquatic species such as fish, shrimp, and oysters range from 26000 to 60000. The health effects of PCBs are well established. These include interference with reproduction in wildlife and experimental animals and effects in birds and mammals including microsomal enzyme induction, porphyrogenic activity, tumour promotion, oestrogen activity and immunosuppression. Because of their high lipophilicity and their stability, the potential to bioaccumulate is great and long-term effects may be significant.</p> <p><b>Environmental Limits:</b></p> <p>PCB limit for Marine water = 0.004 ugm/litre equals 0.000004 mg/L.</p> <p>Classification of waste materials contaminated by PCB's are:</p> <p>PCB Materials: PCB content greater than 10%</p> <p>Scheduled Wastes: PCB content greater than 0.005% = 50 mg/kg or 50 ppm.</p> <p>Non Scheduled Wastes : PCB content greater than 0.0002% = 2 mg/kg or 2ppm.</p> <p>PCB Free Wastes: PCB content less than 0.0002% = 2 mg/kg or 2 ppm.</p> <p>[Polychlorinated Biphenyls Management Plan - Waste Management Secretariat]</p> <p>Materials with more than 0.005% = 50 ppm. are Workplaces</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

PCBs may penetrate into the human body following cutaneous, respiratory or digestive exposure. People occupationally exposed to PCBs have relatively high PCB residue levels in blood plasma. Symptoms include chloracne dermatitis and degreasing of the skin, pigmentation of the skin and nails, excessive eye discharge, erythema, transient visual disturbances, distinctive hair follicles, alopecia, and oedema (swelling) of the eyelids, face and hands. Pigmentation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes has also been noted. Disturbances affecting the mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, nervous system and various enzyme systems have also been recorded. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Dermatological effects include erythematous eruptions with pruritus, skin thickening, and alopecia (generalised hair-loss). The mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth may become pigmented. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. PCBs are hepatotoxins producing liver damage which may be indicated by jaundice. Other signs of liver damage, reported in humans, include cirrhosis, fatty degeneration, necrosis and yellow atrophy. Severe liver damage may result in coma and death. Concurrent exposure with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) may enhance their hepatotoxic effect. Neurological effects include headache, dizziness, irritability, depression, fatigue, impotence, and joint and muscle pain. Additional effects reported in humans following ingestion of PCBs contaminated with dioxins (specifically polychlorinated biphenyls) include fever, hearing difficulties, immunosuppression and menstrual disorders. Enzyme activities may be variously induced or inhibited resulting in the disturbance of normal biological function. Upper respiratory tract irritation, decreased forced vital capacity, chest tightness, and persistent body odour have also been reported. PCBs accumulate in tissues, especially those rich in lipid (fats). They cross the placenta and are excreted in breast milk with resultant toxic effects on the foetus or infant. In infants born to woman with a history of high exposure to PCBs, there is evidence of low mean birth weights and mean gestational ages. As pregnancy depletes reserves of fatty tissue in the mother, exposure to accumulated PCBs by the foetus is artificially enhanced. Extended dermal contact in Rhesus monkeys produced an increase in spontaneous abortions and stillbirth. Maternal toxicity is indicated by alopecia, erythema and oedema of the eyelids. Intrauterine exposure to dioxin-contaminated PCBs produced still-births, \"cola-coloured\" skin, low birth weight, elevated bilirubin, conjunctivitis, enlarged meibomian glands, chloracne, hypoplastic nails, scalp calcification, natal teeth, retarded growth and neurological deficits. Growth retardation and neurological symptoms persisted for several years. Transplacental transfer coupled with exposure through lactation caused locomotor problems, hyperactivity and learning errors in monkeys; these correlated with PCB body levels. Epidemiological data suggests a relationship exists between exposure to PCBs and the development of malignant melanoma, and cancers of the hepatobiliary and digestive systems and the lymphatic and haemopoietic tissues. Several PCBs are carcinogenic to mice and rats following oral administration, producing benign and malignant liver neoplasms. Oral administration of certain PCBs increased the incidence of liver neoplasms in rats previously exposed to the cancer initiator, N-nitrosodiethylamine. In common with other polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, the chlorinated biphenyls exhibit dioxin-like behaviour.</p>",

Methanol  was commonly used both because its boiling point is close to that of ethanol and because it is toxic. Another typical denaturant was pyridine. Often the denatured alcohol is dyed with methyl violet.|The formulation for completely denatured alcohol, according to 2005 British regulations was as follows:|Completely denatured alcohol must be made in accordance with the following formulation: with every 90 parts by volume of alcohol mix 9.5 parts by volume of wood naphtha or a substitute and 0.5 parts by volume of crude pyridine, and to the resulting mixture add mineral naphtha (petroleum oil) in the proportion of 3.75 litres to every 1000 litres of the mixture and synthetic organic dyestuff (methyl violet) in the proportion of 1.5 grams to every 1000 litres of the mixture.",

When released into water the material readily evaporates and is biodegradable.</p> <p>Ethanol does not bioaccumulate to an appreciable extent.</p> <p>The material is readily degraded by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxy radicals; release into air will result in photodegradation and wet deposition.</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p>TERRESTRIAL FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of ethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. The potential for volatilisation of ethanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mmHg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for ethanol based on half-lives on the order of a few days for ethanol in sandy soil/groundwater microcosms.</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method, volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 39 days, respectively.An estimated BCF= 3, from a log Kow of -0.31 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in sunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for ethanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse or absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Ethanol was degraded with half-lives on the order of a few days in aquatic studies conducted using microcosms constructed with a low organic sandy soil and groundwater, indicating it is unlikely to be persistent in aquatic environments(8).\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: Ethanol, which has an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase ethanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days, calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-12 m3/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>log Kow: -0.31- -0.32</p> <p>Half-life (hr) air: 144</p> <p>Half-life (hr) H2O surface water: 144</p> <p>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 6.29E-06</p> <p>BOD 5 if unstated: 0.93-1.67,63%</p> <p>COD: 1.99-2.11,97%</p> <p>ThOD: 2.1</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",
