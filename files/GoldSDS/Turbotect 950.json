Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteEye": "<p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause severe eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>The material is not thought to be a skin irritant (i.e. is unlikely to produce irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives using animal models). Temporary discomfort, however, may result from prolonged dermal exposures. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>There are indications that diethylene glycol monobutyl ether is absorbed through intact skin. Toxic effects only occur at very high doses.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Cyanosis, rapid breathing and heart beat, low blood pressure, muscle tenderness and unconsciousness may follow ingestion of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether. \u00a0Swallowing large or repeated doses may affect kidney function.</p> <p>At sufficiently high doses the material may be nephrotoxic (i.e. poisonous to the kidney).\u00a0</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Studies with some glycol ethers (principally the monoethylene glycols) and their esters indicate reproductive changes, testicular atrophy, infertility and kidney function changes. The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p>",

Alcohol alkoxylates (AA) are used as weakly foaming and foam-mitigating surfactants in household cleaning agents, dishwashing agents and cleaning agents designed for the food industry. Other applications of AA include textile lubricants, agricultural chemicals, and rinse aid formulations</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Alcohol ethoxylates (AE) are nonionic surfactants composed of a hydrophobic alkyl chain (fatty alcohol) which is combined with a number of ethoxylate, or ethylene oxide, units via an ether linkage. Alcohol alkoxylates (AA) normally contain both ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) in their hydrophilic moiety, whereas butylene oxide (BO) is less frequently used. The abbreviation AA has been used to designate nonionic surfactants with a hydrophilic part containing PO (or BO), frequently in combination with EO.\u00a0</p>",

Triethylene- and tetraethylene- glycol ethers represent typical members of the category. All category members can be represented by the generic molecular formula:</p> <p>HO(CH2CH2O)nR - n=2,3,4,5,6 and higher ethylene units and R=alkyl(methyl, ethyl, butyl etc.)</p> <p>All are high boiling liquids of low volatility and high water solubility. Higher molecular weight species and surrogates may be solids at ambient temperatures.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Estimated photodegradation hydroxyl radical rate constants \u00a0for category members are in close agreement. Photodegradation half-lives of triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE), tetraethylene glycol methyl ether (TetraME), and tetraethylene glycol butyl ether (TetraBE) (estimated using the EPIWIN/AOP model) have atmospheric photodegradation half-lives of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 hours respectively.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Ether groups are generally stable to water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. The ether function is hydrolysed by heating in the presence of halogen acids, particularly hydrogen iodide.</p> <p><b>Volatilisation</b>: The category members are highly soluble to miscible in water, possess high boiling points (in excess of 250 C) and low vapour pressures. The estimated Henry's Law Constants, fall in the narrow range of 3.54 E-14 to 3.67 E-13 m3* atm/mol at 25 C point to a limited volatilisation potential.</p> <p><b>Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The ethers in this category possess physical properties that suggest that once they enter the aqueous compartment, they tend to remain dissolved in water. Soil/sediment partition coefficients (Koc) of 10 have been estimated for TGBE, TetraME and TetraBE . These results suggest that the category members have uniformly high soil mobility. Thus, these products can leach from soil deposits to groundwater, but can also be transported to environments where aerobic biodegradation can take place.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>When released to water, some studies show that biodegradation of category members is reasonably rapid . OECD guideline studies indicate biodegradability (&gt; 90%) for TGBE (ready or inherent) and TetraME (inherent). However,another comparative biodegradation study of triethylene glycol methyl ether (TGME), triethylene glycol ethyl ether (TGEE) and triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE) indicate slower rates of biodegradation (from 47-71%). Altogether, the data suggest that different study methodologies provide variable results for the tri- and tetraethylene glycol ethers. No category members or surrogates that were tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>The category members have a limited potential to bioaccumulate (based on log Kow's ranging from -1.73 to +0.51, 20 C), and predicted bioconcentration factors, log BCF = ca. 0.50</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The data suggest that trimethyl, -ethyl and -butyl ethers and are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.</p> <p>The LC50 values for fish, Daphnia, and algae are 2,400 mg/l, \u00a02,210 mg/l, and &gt; 500 mg/l, respectively. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers. Due to the structural and physical similarities of TetraME and TetraBE with the other glycol ethers in the category, it is likely that these glycol ethers are also of low toxicity to aquatic species</p> <p>The toxicity of TGBE, TetraME, TGEE and TGME to bacteria also has been tested. In sewer microorganisms exposed to TGBE, TGEE and TGME for 16 hours, the LD50 values were &gt; 5,000, &gt;10,000 and &gt;5,000 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of TetraME required to cause inhibition of respiration of activated sludge is reportedly &gt; 12,500 mg/kg for 3 hours\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for alcohol ethoxylates</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alcohol (alkyl) ethoxylates (AEs) are generally biodegradable and do not persist for any substantial period in the environment. They are not usually present a concentrations which might produce problems. Contamination of natural waters, however, should be avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The biodegradability of the alcohol ethoxylates (AE) is relatively unaffected by the alkyl carbon chain length and the number of EO units. The linear AE are normally easily degraded under aerobic conditions. Only small differences are seen in the time needed for ultimate degradation of linear AE with different alkyl chain lengths. AE with a typical alkyl chain (e.g., C12 to C15) will normally reach more than 60% degradation in standardized tests for \"ready\" biodegradability. The rate of biodegradation may however be determined by the length of the ethylene oxide (EO) chain. Longer EO chains decrease the bioavailability of the AE (to microorganism) due to increased hydrophilicity and molecular size, which limits the transport of the molecule through the cell wall. The biodegradation of branched AE tends to be slower than biodegradation of linear AE. The biodegradability of AE depends on degree and structure of the branching. The general trend is that the biodegradation decreases considerably with an increasing branching of the carbon chain. The biodegradability of alcohol alkoxylates (AA), similarly, generally decreases with an increasing number of PO units. AA containing 6 PO units did not pass the level required for ready biodegradability whereas the same alcohol containing 2 PO units attained 83% ThOD in the closed bottle test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mineralization observed in experiments with 14C-labelled surfactants suggests that almost complete degradation of linear AE may be expected in anaerobic digesters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available information suggests that alcohol ethoxylates can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic organisms. These effects vary by carbon chain length. Typical alcohol ethoxylate surfactant chain length ranges from 9 to 18 carbons and 3 to 8 ethoxylate groups. Toxicity generally declines as the number of ethoxylates increases</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A summary of chronic toxicity data from 60 studies conducted between 1977 and 2004 on fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plant and algae species states that alcohol ethoxylates\u2019 effects on aquatic species include reduced growth rates, impaired reproduction, and reduced survival of neonates, as well as acute mortality. Alcohol ethoxylates may cause diminished growth rates and reduced cell counts in algae species at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg/L .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The concentrations at which alcohol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality in aquatic species are similar to the concentrations at which nonylphenol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality. However, alcohol ethoxylates degrade more quickly in the aquatic environment to relatively non-toxic compounds, whereas nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation typically yields nonylphenol, which is toxic as well as persistent in the aquatic environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Algae constitute the group of aquatic organisms which appears to be the most sensitive to AE. The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. For the linear AE, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length of C13 ) and decreasing EO chain length. The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to invertebrates varies with EC50 values from 0.1 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.5 mg/l to 50 mg/l for the branched types. The toxicity is species specific and may vary between 0.29 mg/l to 270 mg/l for the same linear AE The most commonly used invertebrates for testing are\u00a0Daphnia magna\u00a0and\u00a0Daphnia pulex, and they are also among the most sensitive invertebrates to AE. Apparently, the toxicity of AE to invertebrates was not related to hydrophobicity as it is the case for algae. Some AE are very toxic to invertebrates, i.e., linear AE of C12-15 EO1-8 and branched AE with a low degree of branching, i.e. &lt; 10-25%. Branching of the alkyl chain reduces the toxicity of AE to invertebrates as also observed for algae.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to fish varies with LC50 values from 0.4 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.25 mg/l to 40 mg/l for the branched AE. For linear AE the toxicity increases with decreasing EO units. AE containing 7-11 EO groups are considered to be very toxic to fish (EC/LC50: 1 mg/l).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special interest are the aryl alcohol ethoxylates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A EU Risk Assessment Report (RAR) concluded that octyl- and nonyl- phenol ethoxylates are\u00a0not readily biodegradable but are inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As a group, these materials are generally toxic to fish with LC50s ranging, typically, between 1-6 mg/l.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special concern are the following families which are classified as\u00a0\"Environmentally Hazardous Substances\"\u00a0(Dangerous Goods Class 9) by either or both the ADR (Accord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Merchandises Dangerous par Route) and the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C 6-17 (secondary) with 3-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C12-15 with 1-3 moles of ethoxylation (1-6 moles of ethoxylation IMDG)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C13-15 with 1-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">New aquatic data suggests that alcohols C 8-9 branched with 3-10 moles of ethoxylation alcohols C 8-9 branched with &gt; 10 moles of ethoxylation should also be classified as\u00a0'harmful to the environment\".</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These alcohols may also be found linked to aromatic structures (in nonylphenol ethoxylates for example).

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
