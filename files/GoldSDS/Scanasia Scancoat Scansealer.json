Investigation of the hazards associated with use of 2-butoxyethanol for alloy electropolishing showed that mixtures with 50-95% of acid at 20 deg C, or 40-90% at 75 C, were explosive and initiable by sparks.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p>",
