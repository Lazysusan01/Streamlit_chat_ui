Triethylene- and tetraethylene- glycol ethers represent typical members of the category. All category members can be represented by the generic molecular formula:</p> <p>HO(CH2CH2O)nR - n=2,3,4,5,6 and higher ethylene units and R=alkyl(methyl, ethyl, butyl etc.)</p> <p>All are high boiling liquids of low volatility and high water solubility. Higher molecular weight species and surrogates may be solids at ambient temperatures.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Estimated photodegradation hydroxyl radical rate constants \u00a0for category members are in close agreement. Photodegradation half-lives of triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE), tetraethylene glycol methyl ether (TetraME), and tetraethylene glycol butyl ether (TetraBE) (estimated using the EPIWIN/AOP model) have atmospheric photodegradation half-lives of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 hours respectively.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Ether groups are generally stable to water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. The ether function is hydrolysed by heating in the presence of halogen acids, particularly hydrogen iodide.</p> <p><b>Volatilisation</b>: The category members are highly soluble to miscible in water, possess high boiling points (in excess of 250 C) and low vapour pressures. The estimated Henry's Law Constants, fall in the narrow range of 3.54 E-14 to 3.67 E-13 m3* atm/mol at 25 C point to a limited volatilisation potential.</p> <p><b>Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The ethers in this category possess physical properties that suggest that once they enter the aqueous compartment, they tend to remain dissolved in water. Soil/sediment partition coefficients (Koc) of 10 have been estimated for TGBE, TetraME and TetraBE . These results suggest that the category members have uniformly high soil mobility. Thus, these products can leach from soil deposits to groundwater, but can also be transported to environments where aerobic biodegradation can take place.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>When released to water, some studies show that biodegradation of category members is reasonably rapid . OECD guideline studies indicate biodegradability (&gt; 90%) for TGBE (ready or inherent) and TetraME (inherent). However,another comparative biodegradation study of triethylene glycol methyl ether (TGME), triethylene glycol ethyl ether (TGEE) and triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE) indicate slower rates of biodegradation (from 47-71%). Altogether, the data suggest that different study methodologies provide variable results for the tri- and tetraethylene glycol ethers. No category members or surrogates that were tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>The category members have a limited potential to bioaccumulate (based on log Kow's ranging from -1.73 to +0.51, 20 C), and predicted bioconcentration factors, log BCF = ca. 0.50</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The data suggest that trimethyl, -ethyl and -butyl ethers and are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.</p> <p>The LC50 values for fish, Daphnia, and algae are 2,400 mg/l, \u00a02,210 mg/l, and &gt; 500 mg/l, respectively. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers. Due to the structural and physical similarities of TetraME and TetraBE with the other glycol ethers in the category, it is likely that these glycol ethers are also of low toxicity to aquatic species</p> <p>The toxicity of TGBE, TetraME, TGEE and TGME to bacteria also has been tested. In sewer microorganisms exposed to TGBE, TGEE and TGME for 16 hours, the LD50 values were &gt; 5,000, &gt;10,000 and &gt;5,000 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of TetraME required to cause inhibition of respiration of activated sludge is reportedly &gt; 12,500 mg/kg for 3 hours\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for alcohol ethoxylates</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alcohol (alkyl) ethoxylates (AEs) are generally biodegradable and do not persist for any substantial period in the environment. They are not usually present a concentrations which might produce problems. Contamination of natural waters, however, should be avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The biodegradability of the alcohol ethoxylates (AE) is relatively unaffected by the alkyl carbon chain length and the number of EO units. The linear AE are normally easily degraded under aerobic conditions. Only small differences are seen in the time needed for ultimate degradation of linear AE with different alkyl chain lengths. AE with a typical alkyl chain (e.g., C12 to C15) will normally reach more than 60% degradation in standardized tests for \"ready\" biodegradability. The rate of biodegradation may however be determined by the length of the ethylene oxide (EO) chain. Longer EO chains decrease the bioavailability of the AE (to microorganism) due to increased hydrophilicity and molecular size, which limits the transport of the molecule through the cell wall. The biodegradation of branched AE tends to be slower than biodegradation of linear AE. The biodegradability of AE depends on degree and structure of the branching. The general trend is that the biodegradation decreases considerably with an increasing branching of the carbon chain. The biodegradability of alcohol alkoxylates (AA), similarly, generally decreases with an increasing number of PO units. AA containing 6 PO units did not pass the level required for ready biodegradability whereas the same alcohol containing 2 PO units attained 83% ThOD in the closed bottle test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mineralization observed in experiments with 14C-labelled surfactants suggests that almost complete degradation of linear AE may be expected in anaerobic digesters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available information suggests that alcohol ethoxylates can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic organisms. These effects vary by carbon chain length. Typical alcohol ethoxylate surfactant chain length ranges from 9 to 18 carbons and 3 to 8 ethoxylate groups. Toxicity generally declines as the number of ethoxylates increases</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A summary of chronic toxicity data from 60 studies conducted between 1977 and 2004 on fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plant and algae species states that alcohol ethoxylates\u2019 effects on aquatic species include reduced growth rates, impaired reproduction, and reduced survival of neonates, as well as acute mortality. Alcohol ethoxylates may cause diminished growth rates and reduced cell counts in algae species at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg/L .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The concentrations at which alcohol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality in aquatic species are similar to the concentrations at which nonylphenol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality. However, alcohol ethoxylates degrade more quickly in the aquatic environment to relatively non-toxic compounds, whereas nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation typically yields nonylphenol, which is toxic as well as persistent in the aquatic environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Algae constitute the group of aquatic organisms which appears to be the most sensitive to AE. The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. For the linear AE, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length of C13 ) and decreasing EO chain length. The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to invertebrates varies with EC50 values from 0.1 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.5 mg/l to 50 mg/l for the branched types. The toxicity is species specific and may vary between 0.29 mg/l to 270 mg/l for the same linear AE The most commonly used invertebrates for testing are\u00a0Daphnia magna\u00a0and\u00a0Daphnia pulex, and they are also among the most sensitive invertebrates to AE. Apparently, the toxicity of AE to invertebrates was not related to hydrophobicity as it is the case for algae. Some AE are very toxic to invertebrates, i.e., linear AE of C12-15 EO1-8 and branched AE with a low degree of branching, i.e. &lt; 10-25%. Branching of the alkyl chain reduces the toxicity of AE to invertebrates as also observed for algae.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to fish varies with LC50 values from 0.4 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.25 mg/l to 40 mg/l for the branched AE. For linear AE the toxicity increases with decreasing EO units. AE containing 7-11 EO groups are considered to be very toxic to fish (EC/LC50: 1 mg/l).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special interest are the aryl alcohol ethoxylates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A EU Risk Assessment Report (RAR) concluded that octyl- and nonyl- phenol ethoxylates are\u00a0not readily biodegradable but are inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As a group, these materials are generally toxic to fish with LC50s ranging, typically, between 1-6 mg/l.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special concern are the following families which are classified as\u00a0\"Environmentally Hazardous Substances\"\u00a0(Dangerous Goods Class 9) by either or both the ADR (Accord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Merchandises Dangerous par Route) and the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C 6-17 (secondary) with 3-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C12-15 with 1-3 moles of ethoxylation (1-6 moles of ethoxylation IMDG)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C13-15 with 1-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">New aquatic data suggests that alcohols C 8-9 branched with 3-10 moles of ethoxylation alcohols C 8-9 branched with &gt; 10 moles of ethoxylation should also be classified as\u00a0'harmful to the environment\".</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These alcohols may also be found linked to aromatic structures (in nonylphenol ethoxylates for example).

On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly.

If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or irritation of the respiratory tract (as classified by EC Directives using animal models).

                "AcuteEye": "<p><br /></p> <p>Some nonionic surfactants may produce a localised anaesthetic effect on the cornea; this may effectively eliminate the warning discomfort produced by other substances and lead to corneal injury. Irritant effects range from minimal to severe dependent on the nature of the surfactant, its concentration and the duration of contact. Pain and corneal damage represent the most severe manifestation of irritation.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
