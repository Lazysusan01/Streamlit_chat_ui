                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For isobutane:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Refrigerant Gas: Saturated Hydrocarbons have zero ozone depletion\r\npotential (ODP) and will photodegrade under atmospheric conditions.\r\n&nbsp;[Calor Gas]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental Fate</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Terrestrial fate:&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>&nbsp;An\r\nestimated Koc value of 35 suggests that isobutane will have very high mobility\r\nin soil.

When isobutane was exposed to sunlight for 6 hr in a tedlar bag filled with\r\nLos Angeles air, 6% of the isobutane degraded The air contained 4529 ppb-C\r\nhydrocarbons and 870 ppb of NOX. The tropospheric loss of volatile hydrocarbons\r\nsuch as isobutane by wet and dry deposition are believed to be of minor\r\nimportance. Indeed, isobutane assimilated into precipitation may evaporate\r\nduring transport as well as being reemitted into the atmosphere after\r\ndeposition. Isobutane is a contributor to the production of PAN (peroxyacyl\r\nnitrates) under photochemical smog conditions</span></p> <p>For propane:</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate</b></p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>: An estimated Koc value of 460 determined from a log Kow of 2.36 indicates that propane is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Volatilisation of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07x10-1 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg, and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L. Propane is expected to volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using cell suspensions of microorganisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidised to acetone within 24 hours, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>The estimated Koc value indicates that propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law constant volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are estimated to be 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively. \u00a0An estimated BCF of 13.1 using log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. After 192 hr, the trace concentration of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate</b>:: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour pressure, propane is expected to exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>No health effects were seen in humans exposed at 1,000 ppm isobutane for up to 8 hours or 500 ppm for 8 hours/day for 10 days. Isobutane can have anaesthetic and asphyxiant effects at high concentrations, well above the lower explosion limit of 1.8% (18,000 ppm).</p> <p>Butane is a simple asphyxiant and is mildly anaesthetic at high concentrations (20-25%). 10000 ppm for 10 minutes causes drowsiness.</p> <p>Narcotic effects may be accompanied by exhilaration, dizziness, headache, nausea, confusion, incoordination and unconsciousness in severe cases</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays.

Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Hydrocarbons may sensitise the heart to adrenalin and other circulatory catecholamines; as a result cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation may occur. Abrupt collapse may produce traumatic injury. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may be evident early. Symptoms of moderate poisoning may include giddiness, headache, dizziness and nausea. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation. Symptoms include rapid respiration, mental dullness, lack of coordination, poor judgement, nausea and vomiting. The onset of cyanosis may lead to unconsciousness and death.</p>",

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
