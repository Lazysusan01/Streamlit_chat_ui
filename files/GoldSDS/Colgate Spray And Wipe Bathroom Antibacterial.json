The two isomeric forms are shown above. The di- and tripropylene glycol ethers may form up to 4 and 8 isomeric forms, respectively. Even so, all isomers exhibit either the \"alpha\" or \"beta\" configuration, existing as secondary or primary alcohols, respectively. The distribution of isomeric forms for the di- and tripropylene glycols, as with the mono-PGEs, also results in predominantly the alpha form (i.e., a secondary alcohol). It should be noted that only the alpha isomer and isomeric mixtures (consisting predominantly of the alpha isomer) are produced commercially; the purified beta isomer is not produced at this time.</p>",

This seems likely to involve formation of the glycol perchlorate esters (after scission of ethers) which are explosive, those of ethylene glycol and 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol being more powerful than glyceryl nitrate, and the former so sensitive that it explodes on addition of water . Investigation of the hazards associated with use of 2-butoxyethanol for alloy electropolishing showed that mixtures with 50-95% of acid at 20 deg C, or 40-90% at 75 C, were explosive and initiable by sparks. Sparking caused mixtures with 40-50% of acid to become explosive, but 30% solutions appeared safe under static conditions of temperature and concentration.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Avoid reaction with oxidising agents\u00a0</li> </ul>",

Calculated BCFs range from 1.47 for DPnB to 3.16 for DPMA and TPM, indicating low bioaccumulation. Henry's Law Constants, which indicate propensity to partition from water to air, are low for all category members, ranging from 5.7 x 10-9 atm-m3/mole for TPM to 2.7 x10-9 atm-m3/mole for PnB. Fugacity modeling indicates that most propylene glycol ethers are likely to partition roughly equally into the soil and water compartments in the environment with small to negligible amounts remaining in other environmental compartments (air, sediment, and aquatic biota). Propylene glycol ethers are unlikely to persist in the environment. Once in air, the half-life of the category members due to direct reactions with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals, range from 2.0 hours for TPM to 4.6 hours for PnB. In water, most \u00a0members of this family \u00a0are \"readily biodegradable\" under aerobic conditions. (DPMA degraded within 28 days (and within the specified 10-day window) but only using pre-adapted or \"acclimated\" inoculum.). In soil, biodegradation is rapid for PM and PMA.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute aquatic toxicity testing indicates low toxicity for both ethers and acetates.

For acetates, effect concentrations are &gt; 151 mg/L.</p> <p>For glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Ether groups are generally stable to hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. OECD guideline studies indicate ready biodegradability for several glycol ethers although higher molecular weight species seem to biodegrade at a slower rate. No glycol ethers that have been tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes. Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr). When released to water, glycol ethers undergo biodegradation (typically 47-92% after 8-21 days) and have a low potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow ranges from -1.73 to +0.51).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic toxicity data indicate that the tri- and tetra ethylene glycol ethers are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage.

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "Use": "<p>alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) are useful building blocks in organic synthesis. For example, alpha-hydroxy acids are generally useful as precursors in the preparation aldehydes via oxidative cleavage. Compounds of this class are used on the industrial-scale and include glycolic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, and mandelic acid.] They are susceptible to acid-catalyzed decarbonylation to give, in addition to carbon monoxide, a ketone/aldehyde and water.<br />Although these compounds are related to the ordinary carboxylic acids, and therefore are weak acids, their chemical structure allows for the formation of an internal hydrogen bond between the hydrogen at the hydroxyl group and one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group. Two effects emerge from this situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the \"occupation\" of electrons of the carboxylic oxygens in the hydrogen bonding, the acidic proton is held less strongly, as the same electrons are used in bonding that hydrogen too. So the pKa of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is a full unit lower compared to that of propionic acid itself</li>\n<li>The internal bridging hydrogen is locked in its place on the NMR timescale: in mandelic acid (2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetic acid) this proton couples to the one on carbon in the same way and magnitude as hydrogens on geminal carbon atoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Racemic alpha-hydroxy acids are classically prepared by addition of hydrogen cyanide to a ketone or aldehyde, followed by acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile function of the resulting cyanohydrin product.<br />alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) are often found in products that aid in the reduction of wrinkles as well as to soften strong, defining lines and improve the overall look and feel of the skin. They are also used as chemical peels available in a dermatologist's office, beauty and health spas and home kits, which usually contain a lower concentration of around 4%. ..<br />AHAs most commonly used in cosmetic applications are typically similar to those found in food products including glycolic acid (found in sugar cane), lactic acid (found in sour milk), malic acid (found in apples), citric acid (found in citrus fruits) and tartaric acid (found in grape wine) - though the source of the AHAs in cosmetics is predominantly synthetic or from bacterial or fungal fermentations. For any topical compound to be effective, including AHA, it must penetrate into the skin where it can act on living cells. Bioavailability (influenced primarily by small molecular size) is an important factor in a compound's ability to penetrate the top layer of the skin. Glycolic acid, having the smallest molecular size, is the AHA with greatest bioavailability and penetrates the skin most easily; this largely accounts for the popularity of this product in cosmetic applications.<br />AHAs have a profound effect on keratinization; which is clinically detectable by the formation of a new stratum corneum. It appears that AHAs modulate this formation through diminished cellular cohesion between corneocytes at the lowest levels of the stratum corneum.<br />AHAs with greater bioavailability appear to have deeper dermal effects. Glycolic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid, on topical application to photodamaged skin, have been shown to produce increased amounts of mucopolysaccharides and collagen and increased skin thickness without detectable inflammation, as monitored by skin biopsies<br />alpha-Hydroxy acids (AHAs), are a class of chemical compounds that consist of a carboxylic acid substituted with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon.\u00a0</p>|Cultured dairy products, as an acidulant additive in foods, manufacture of lactate chemicals (salts, plasticizers, adhesives, pharmaceuticals), mordant in dyeing wool.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p>|Clinical studies indicate even dilute preparations have some corrosive action in the human oesophagus and stomach [Gosselin]|Ingestion may produce vomiting, perspiration and shortness of breath.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
