QASs generally act\r\nby disruption of the cytosolic membrane and outer lipid bilayer via replacement\r\nof bivalent ions and attachment to the membrane, followed by the incorporation\r\nof the hydrophobic side chain into the phospholipid bilayer and the creation of\r\na mixed micelle with the phospholipids, resulting ultimately in cytosol\r\nleakage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Whereas bacterial membranes are\r\ncomposed predominantly of negatively charged phospholipids, eukaryotic\r\nmembranes mostly contain zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol. Such a difference\r\nin composition is a good precondition for a selective effect against microbes,\r\nand therefore, QAS should exhibit selectivity to microorganisms over eukaryotic\r\ncells\u00a0 Indeed, selectivity is obvious even among microorganisms. Gram-positive\r\n(G+) bacteria are more sensitive than Gram-negative (G-). The increased\r\nresistance of G- is most likely a consequence of the presence of the outer\r\nmembrane layer which grants the cells stronger physicochemical protection.\r\nInterestingly, the relationship between the alkyl side-chain length and\r\nantibacterial activity is nonlinear. Optimal bioactivity is exhibited by\r\nC12-C14 chains for G+, and C14-C16 chains for G- bacteria However, the\r\nlipophilicity of the side chains seems to be a crucial factor, although the\r\nprecise mechanism of action and structure\u2013activity relationship is not yet\r\nfully understood</span></p> <p>Synthetic polymer.\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Acrylate polymers are a group of\r\npolymers noted for their transparency, resistance to breakage, and elasticity.\r\nThey are also commonly known as acrylics or polyacrylates. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The term \u2018acrylic\u2019 resin is\r\ngenerally applied to the polymers and copolymers of methacrylic and acrylic\r\nacid. Frequently the copolymers of one or more of these esters with nonacrylic\r\nmonomers such as styrene, butadiene or vinyl acetate are also referred to as\r\nacrylic resins, but usage of the term is usually reserved for those resins\r\nwhich are predominantly of the characteristic acrylic or methacrylic structure\r\n. The main properties imparted by the acrylics as a class are: outstanding\r\noutdoor durability, water white colour, excellent clarity, resistance to\r\ndiscoloration at high temperatures, excellent flexibility and toughness,\r\nresistance to chemical fumes, alkalies, acids and water, high gloss and\r\nexcellent gloss retention and, finally, minimum pigment reactivity. Acrylic\r\nresins used in the surface coatings industry can be divided into two main\r\ngroups: (a) thermoplastic resins and (b) thermosetting resins. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyacrylate describes a number\r\nof synthetic resins produced by the polymerization of acrylic esters. The\r\npolyacrylates are employed primarily in paints and other surface coatings, in\r\nadhesives, and in textiles. Acrylate polymer is commonly used in cosmetics such\r\nas nail polish as an adhesive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyacrylate formulations are\r\nhardened by copolymerizing the acrylate with other monomers such as methyl\r\nmethacrylate or styrene. Polyacrylates can be modified to produce a specialty\r\nrubber known as polyacrylate elastomer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyacrylates are often added to\r\nrigid PVC as impact modifiers and processing aids.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyacrylate adhesives are\r\npredominately copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates with small amounts of\r\nthe acids. Glass transition (and stiffness) of the copolymer is controlled by\r\nthe type and amounts of comonomers. Adhesives with higher stiffness are used in\r\nceramic tile bonding and lamination of plastic films to wood, for example. The\r\nmore flexible (lower Tg) polymers, made cross-linkable by copolymerization\r\nwith, for example, N-hydroxymethylacrylamide, are used in textile treatment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The main advantages of\r\nthermosetting (TSA) resins arise from: (1) the variety of functional monomers\r\nthat can be incorporated into the polymer, allowing them to be cured with\r\nseveral different crosslinking agents and provide specific properties such as\r\nadhesion to diverse substrates, efficient pigment-wetting and controlled\r\ncrosslink-density; (2) the variety of nonfunctional monomers available for\r\nimparting a desirable balance of hardness, toughness and resistance properties;\r\nand (3) the excellent inherent property advantages of acrylics as mentioned\r\nabove.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">TSA coatings are used in a\r\nvariety of applications such as automotive finishes, appliance finishes,\r\ncoatings for the exterior surfaces of coils, can coating and metal decoration.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyquaterniums are reported to\r\nbe used as coagulants and flocculants for water and wastewater treatment, pulp\r\nand paper production and oil field applications. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyquaterniums find particular\r\napplication in conditioners, shampoo, hair mousse, hair spray, hair dye,\r\npersonal lubricant, and contact lens solutions. Because they are positively\r\ncharged, they neutralize the negative charges of most shampoos and hair\r\nproteins and help hair lie flat. Their positive charges also ionically bond\r\nthem to hair and skin. Some have antimicrobial properties. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polyquaternium is the\r\nInternational Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients designation for several\r\npolycationic polymers that are used in the personal care industry. Different\r\npolymers are distinguished by the numerical value that follows the word\r\n\"polyquaternium\". Polyquaternium-5, polyquaternium-7, and\r\npolyquaternium-47 are three examples, each a chemically different type of\r\npolymer. The numbers are assigned in the order in which they are registered\r\nrather than because of their chemical structure. </span></p> <p>Polyacrylamide derivative<br />Polyacrylamides are used in such  applications as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the manufacture  of soft contact lens. In the straight-chain form, polyacrylamide is used  as a thickener and suspending agent. Polyacrylamide is used\u00a0 to  flocculate solids in a liquid.<br />Another common use of polyacrylamide  and its derivatives is in subsurface applications such as Enhanced Oil  Recovery. High viscosity aqueous solutions can be generated with low  concentrations of polyacrylamide polymers, and these can be injected to  improve the economics of conventional waterflooding. More recently, it  has been used as a subdermal filler for aesthetic facial surgery <br />Polyacrylamide  are called \"ghost crystals\" when cross-linked, The cross-linked form  which retains water is often used for horticultural and agricultural <br />The  anionic form of linear, water soluble polyacrylamide is frequently used  as a soil conditioner on farm land and construction sites for erosion  control, in order to protect the water quality of nearby rivers and  streams.<br />The ionic form of polyacrylamide has found an important role  in the potable water treatment industry. Trivalent metal salts, like  ferric chloride and aluminum chloride, are bridged by the long polymer  chains of polyacrylamide. This results in significant enhancement of the  flocculation rate. This allows water treatment plants to greatly  improve the removal of total organic content (TOC) from raw water.<br />Polyacrylamide  is also often used in molecular biology applications as a medium for  electrophoresis of proteins and nucleic acids in a technique known as  PAGE.<br />It was also used in the synthesis of the first Boger fluid (elastic fluids with constant viscosity).</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

The degree of interaction depends on both the properties of the polymer and properties of the soil. They are often effective in stabilising soil aggregates, reducing soil erosion, and increasing water infiltration, and also have an indirect significant impact upon crop growth and yield.The ionic charge properties of polyacrylamides play an integral part absorption to soil. cationic polyacrylamides are toxic to aquatic organisms and are not used to amend soils. Anionic polyacrylamides, being negatively charged like clay surfaces,bind to negatively charged clays through a process called cation bridging. Divalent cation s are able to bridge the two negative species together. Each positive charge of the divalent cation binds to one of the negative sites, either the clay surface or the anionic polyacrylamide. Divalent cations may occur naturally on the clay surface or may be introduced in the polyacrylamide solution.</p> <p>For the most part, polyacrylamide is resistant to microbial attack, and its degradation is mainly through physical breakdown. Polyacrylamide has been shown to be non-toxic to humans, animals, fish, and plants; the only concern has been the toxicity of its residual monomer (acrylamide) content, which is a known neurotoxin to humans. Polyacrylamide can also degrade to acrylamide under environmental conditions The monomer \u00a0is bio-degradable and does not accumulate in soils. .</p> <p>Surfactants are in general toxic to aquatic organisms due to their surface-active properties. Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">For high molecular weight\r\nsynthetic polymers: (according to the Sustainable Futures (SF) program (U.S.\r\nEPA 2005b; U.S. EPA 2012c) polymer assessment guidance.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">High MW polymers are expected:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">to have low vapour pressure and are not expected to undergo\r\nvolatilization .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0to adsorb strongly to soil and sediment </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">to be non-biodegradable (not anticipated to be assimilated by\r\nmicroorganisms.- therefore, biodegradation is not expected to be an important\r\nremoval process.

It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.</p> <p>Very little is known about biodegradation pathways of alkyltrimethylammonium \u00a0(ATMA) salts. Two potential points of attack have been proposed. The degradation may either be initiated by a fission of the C-N bond in which the alkyl chain or a methyl group is cleaved from a tertiary amine, or by an omega-oxidation in which the far end of the alkyl chain is first oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Biodegradation can then proceed via beta-oxidation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants. The toxicity of ATMAB and ATMAC (alkyltrimethylammonium bromide and chloride) to algae is characterized by EC50 values below 1 mg/l.</p> <p>ATMAC are acutely toxic to aquatic invertebrates as indicated by EC/LC50 values below 1 mg/l for alkyl chain lengths of C16 \u00a0exposed artificial stream mesocosms housing the freshwater clam\u00a0<i>Corbicula fluminea\u00a0</i>with C12 ATMAC. Minor and transient effects on length gain were observed at 43 ug/l during weeks 2-4 and 6-7, but these effects were not evident at the end of the experiment after 8 weeks. One study with the species\u00a0<i>Idus melatonus\u00a0</i>indicates that some ATMAC are also toxic to fish Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Low molecular weight QACs are very soluble in water, but slightly or not at all soluble in solvents such as ether, petrol and benzene. As the molecular weight and chain lengths increases, the solubility in polar solvents (e.g. water) decreases and the solubility in non-polar solvents increases.\u00a0</p> <p>  <b>Environmental fate</b></p> <p>A major part of the QACs is discharged into wastewater and removed in the biological processes of sewage treatment plant. A 90% reduction of the QACs in the water phase of sludge has been reported and alkyl di-/ trimethyl ammonium and alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium compounds seem almost completely degraded in sewage sludge.</p> <p>However, the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of QACs is not well investigated. Only sparse data are available concerning stability, solubility and biodegradability. In general, it seems that the biodegradability decreases with increasing numbers of alkyl chains: R(CH3)3N+ &gt; R2(CH3)2N+ &gt; R3(CH3)N+ . Within each category the biodegradability seems inversely proportional to the alkyl chain length.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure.

Estimations based on a \"highly\" dispersed\r\npolymer population suggest that a polymer of approximate molecular weight 5000\r\ncould contain no more than one reactive group of high concern for it to be\r\nregulated as a polymer of low concern (a so-called PLC) Polymers with a\r\nmolecular weight above 10000 are generally considered to be PLCs because these\r\nare not expected to be absorbed by biological systems. The choice of 10000 as a\r\ncut-off value is thought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as\r\nreasonable in light of limited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which\r\neffects are seen, and extrapolation from animals to humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ingredients in the Acrylates\r\nCopolymer group all contain the monomers acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or\r\none of their salts or esters. These ingredients are considered similar in that\r\nthey are uniformly produced in chemical reactions that leave very little\r\nresidual monomer. Although residual acrylic acid may be as high as 1500 ppm,\r\ntypical levels are 10 to 1000 ppm. There is sufficient odor if residual\r\nmonomers are present to cause producers to keep levels as low as possible.\r\nThese ingredients function in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair\r\nfixatives, suspending agents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion\r\nstabilizers. Concentrations may be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film\r\nformer, or fixative; or as low as 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent,\r\nsuspending agent, or emulsion stabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit\r\nlittle toxicity. In rabbits and guinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce\r\nirritation, but no evidence of sensitization was found. The principle concern\r\nregarding the use of these polymer ingredients is the presence of toxic\r\nresidual monomers. In particular, although 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ngenotoxic, it was carcinogenic when applied at a concentration of 21% to the\r\nskin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations (2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high\r\nconcentrations (43%) were not carcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ncarcinogenic in studies using NMRI mice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis\r\nwas seen or not, there was evidence of severe dermal irritation in these\r\n2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another concern regarding residual monomers was\r\ninhalation toxicity. Although the acrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant,\r\nexposure to the monomer from use of these polymers in cosmetic formulations\r\nwould always be less than the established occupational exposure limits for\r\nnasal irritation. Although there appears to be a huge variation in the mix of\r\nmonomers used in the synthesis of these polymers, they are similar in that the\r\npolymers, except for dermal irritation, are not significantly toxic, and\r\nresidual monomer levels are kept as low as possible. Although the monomers may\r\nbe toxic, the levels that would be found in cosmetic formulations are not\r\nconsidered to present a safety risk. Accordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are\r\nconsidered safe for use in cosmetic formulations when formulated to avoid\r\nirritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p> <p>Most undiluted cationic surfactants satisfy the criteria for classification as Harmful (Xn) with R22 and as Irritant (Xi) for skin and eyes with R38 and R41.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed.

After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <p>Experience indicates that the following polymers are suitable as glove materials for protection against undissolved, dry solids, where abrasive particles are not present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>polychloroprene. </li>\n<li>nitrile rubber. </li>\n<li>butyl rubber. </li>\n<li>fluorocaoutchouc. </li>\n<li>polyvinyl chloride. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gloves should be examined for wear and/ or degradation constantly.</p>"

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
