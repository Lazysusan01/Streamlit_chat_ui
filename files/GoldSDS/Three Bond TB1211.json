In unsaturated topsoil containing organic material, it has been estimated that 97% of the toluene is adsorbed to the soil and only about 2% is in the soil-water phase and transported with flowing groundwater. There is little retardation in sandy soils and 2-13% of the toluene was estimated to migrate with flowing water; the remainder was volatilised, biodegraded, or unaccounted for. In saturated deep soils with no soil-air phase, about 48% may be transported with flowing groundwater.</p> <p><b>Transformation/Persistence:</b></p> <p><b>Air\u00a0</b>- The main degradation pathway for toluene in the atmosphere is reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The estimated atmospheric half life for toluene is about 13 hours. Toluene is also oxidised by reactions with atmospheric nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and ozone, but these are minor degradation pathways. Photolysis is not considered a significant degradative pathway for toluene\u00a0</p> <p><b>Soil\u00a0</b>- In surface soil, volatilisation to air is an important fate process for toluene. Biodegradation of toluene has been demonstrated in the laboratory to occur with a half life of about 1 hour. In the environment, biodegradation of toluene to carbon dioxide occurs with a typical half life of 1-7 days.</p> <p><b>Water\u00a0</b>- An important fate process for toluene is volatilization, the rate of which depends on the amount of turbulence in the surface water .The volatilisation of toluene from static water has a half life of 1-16 days, whereas from turbulent water the half life is 5-6 hours. Degradation of toluene in surface water occurs primarily by biodegradation with a half life of less than one day under favorable conditions (presence of microorganisms, microbial adaptation, and optimum temperature). Biodegradation also occurs in shallow groundwater and in salt water at a reduced rate). No data are available on anaerobic degradation of toluene in deep ground water conditions where aerobic degradation would be minimal .</p> <p><b>Biota\u00a0</b>- Bioaccumulation in most organisms is limited by the metabolism of toluene into more polar compounds that have greater water solubility and a lower affinity for lipids.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Chronic toluene habituation occurs following intentional abuse (glue sniffing) or from occupational exposure. Ataxia, incoordination and tremors of the hands and feet (as a consequence of diffuse cerebral atrophy), headache, abnormal speech, transient memory loss, convulsions, coma, drowsiness, reduced colour perception, frank blindness, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye-movements), hearing loss leading to deafness and mild dementia have all been associated with chronic abuse. Peripheral nerve damage, encephalopathy, giant axonopathy electrolyte disturbances in the cerebrospinal fluid and abnormal computer tomographic (CT scans) are common amongst toluene addicts. Although toluene abuse has been linked with kidney disease, this does not commonly appear in cases of occupational toluene exposures. Cardiac and haematological toxicity are however associated with chronic toluene exposures. Cardiac arrhythmia, multifocal and premature ventricular contractions and supraventricular tachycardia are present in 20% of patients who abused toluene-containing paints. Previous suggestions that chronic toluene inhalation produced human peripheral neuropathy have been discounted. However central nervous system (CNS) depression is well documented where blood toluene exceeds 2.2 mg%. Toluene abusers can achieve transient circulating concentrations of 6.5 %. Amongst workers exposed for a median time of 29 years, to toluene, no subacute effects on neurasthenic complaints and psychometric test results could be established.\u00a0</p> <p>The prenatal toxicity of very high toluene concentrations has been documented for several animal species and man. Malformations indicative of specific teratogenicity have not generally been found. Neonatal toxicity, described in the literature, takes the form of embryo death or delayed foetal growth and delayed skeletal system development. Permanent damage of children has been seen only when mothers have suffered from chronic intoxication as a result of \"sniffing\".</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

The relationship between energy of decomposition and processing hazards has been the subject of discussion; it is suggested that values of energy released per unit of mass, rather than on a molar basis (J/g) be used in the assessment. For example, in \"open vessel processes\" (with man-hole size openings, in an industrial setting), substances with exothermic decomposition energies below 500 J/g are unlikely to present a danger, whilst those in \"closed vessel processes\" (opening is a safety valve or bursting disk) present some danger where the decomposition energy exceeds 150 J/g.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>BRETHERICK: Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 4th Edition</p> <ul> <li>Avoid any contamination of this material as it is very reactive and any contamination is potentially hazardous\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Ketones in this group:</p> <ul> <li>are reactive with many acids and bases liberating heat and flammable gases (e.g., H2).\u00a0</li> <li>react with reducing agents such as hydrides, alkali metals, and nitrides to produce flammable gas (H2) and heat.\u00a0</li> <li>are incompatible with isocyanates, aldehydes, cyanides, peroxides, and anhydrides.\u00a0</li> <li>react violently with aldehydes, HNO3 (nitric acid), HNO3 + H2O2 (mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide), and HClO4 (perchloric acid).\u00a0</li> <li>may react with hydrogen peroxide to form unstable peroxides; many are heat- and shock-sensitive explosives.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>A significant property of most ketones is that the hydrogen atoms on the carbons next to the carbonyl group are relatively acidic when compared to hydrogen atoms in typical hydrocarbons.

At 20 C, MEKO is hydrolytically unstable at pH 4, whereas no hydrolysis occurs at pH 9. At pH 7, 14% of the substance was hydrolysed after 4 days. Therefore, at neutral to acidic environmental conditions, hydrolysis may be an important degradation pathway for this substance. Hydrolysis products are methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) (CAS RN 78-93-3) and hydroxylamine (CAS RN 7803-49-8) . The inherent biodegradation study (MITI 1992) suggests that this substance undergoes relatively rapid primary biodegradation, but that ultimate degradation is slower\u00a0</p> <p>The BIOWIN (2008) aerobic biodegradation models (BIOWIN submodels 3, 4, 5 and 6) suggest that MEKO biodegrades rapidly\u00a0</p> <p>Although little MEKO is expected to partition to sediment, the modelled BIOWIN (2008) biodegradation timeframes (order of weeks), along with the potential for hydrolysis, suggest that the primary degradation half-life in water is likely &lt;90 days.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on the empirical and modelled data , MEKO meets the persistence criterion in air (half-life in air .2 days), but does not meet the criteria for water, soil or sediment (half-lives in soil and water .182 days and half-life in sediment . 365 days), as set out in the\u00a0<i>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations\u00a0</i>(Canada 2000).\u00a0</p> <p>Experimental log Kow values for MEKO suggest that this chemical has low potential to bioaccumulate in biota. Experimentally derived bioconcentration factors (BCF) of 0.5-5.8 for carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) and Japanese medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) (MITI 1992; ECB 2000) demonstrate that MEKO is not bioaccumulative\u00a0</p> <p>Furthermore, log Kow values for the hydrolysis products methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and hydroxylamine are very low , indicating that these chemicals also have low potential to bioaccumulate.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on the available empirical and kinetic-based modelled values, MEKO does not meet the bioaccumulation criteria (BAF or BCF .5000) as set out in the\u00a0<i>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations\u00a0</i>(Canada 2000).\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The toxicity data indicate that MEKO has a moderate potential to be toxic to algae and a low potential for most other aquatic organisms. Furthermore, considering the toxicity of the hydrolysis products (methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and hydroxylamine), as well as the low rate of hydrolysis (14% in 4 days) under environmental conditions, the risk due to the hydrolysis products of MEKO is not expected to be significantly higher than that of the compound itself\u00a0</p> <p>Fish LC50 (48 \u00a0h): Oryzias latipes (Medaka) 560 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) 10-840 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 (48 h): 750 mg/l</p> <p>EC50 \u00a0(0.1 h): Vibrio (Photobacterium) phosphoreum 950 ppm</p> <p>Toxicity invertebrate: tox bac 0.63g/l, protozoa 2.5g/l</p> <p>Effects on algae and plankton: tox to algae at 1g/l</p> <p>.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Several ketoximes (p-quinone dioxime, acetoxime and methyl ethyl ketoxime) have elicited carcinogenic effects on chronic exposure. Few substantive studies have been performed with aldoximes. The fact that aldoximes can be metabolised to cyanide via a pathway not applicable to ketoximes distinguishes the type of response which might be anticipated. Dehydration of aldoximes to produce nitriles has been shown to be catalysed in vitro by cytochrome P450; dehydration of ketoximes produces amides, rather than nitriles, via a Beckmann rearrangement but this apparently has no analogue in biological systems.</p> <p>The mechanism and toxicity of oximes to erythrocytes is recognised and might be attributed to hydroxylamine, a product of hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine produces haematologic effects such as methaemoglobinaemia and splenomegaly in mice similar to those observed after exposure to oximes such as butanal oxime. Studies demonstrated the formation of haeme-associated free radicals in erythrocytes exposed to hydroxylamine, leading ultimately to peroxidation of membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes may produce several morphological alterations resulting, for example, in membrane aggregation, deformation or breakage. This may result in the release of hydrolytic enzymes which in turn may degrade functional macromolecules and cause secondary damage. In addition membrane-bound enzyme systems may be disrupted. Levels of hydroxylamine produced as a result of hydrolysis are thought to be too low to produce another sign of hydroxylamine toxicity, namely the formation of Heinz bodies</p> <p>Oximes are not easily oxidised at near neutral conditions and hydrolysis by liver microsomes or S9 is hypothesised (however this conclusion was based on the formation of a ketone rather than hydroxylamine). Another possibility is that oximes are oxidatively metabolised to yield a ketone or aldehyde and some yet to be determined nitrogen-containing species. Cytochrome P450 appears to provide a source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide which catalyses oxidation in the presence of iron. \u00a0At least part of the nitrogen in the oxime is converted to nitric oxide which complexes with haeme to give a nitrosylhaemoglobin complex.</p> <p>Methyl ethyl ketoxime (MEKO) administered to rats by gavage at 25, 75 and 225 mg/kg/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks, produced dose-related decreases in red blood cell counts and haemoglobin and haematocrit values accompanied by a mild to marked reticulocytosis (increased number of young red blood cells).</p> <p>Other effects included a dose-related pattern of spleen, liver and kidney weights. The spleen and liver showed evidence of compensatory red blood cell production suggesting that, in the rat, MEKO induces haemolytic anaemia with complementary erythropoiesis. A no-observed-effect-level was not established but effects at 25 mg/kg were described as minimal.</p> <p>When MEKO was administered to rats at dose levels of 0.5, and 1.0 ml/kg/day, daily for 4 weeks, transient central nervous system depression immediately followed. At 4 weeks dose-related decreases were seen in red blood cell count and haemoglobin. Dose-related increases were evident in spleen weight (from 1.7 to 3.2 fold). It was concluded that 0.1 ml/kg produced only minimal effects. When rats were exposed by inhalation to MEKO vapour for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, mild increases in blood mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, reticulocyte count and red blood cell count were seen at 533 and 714 ppm. Spleen weights were increased and haemosiderosis (deposits of iron) in the spleen were seen at 714 ppm.</p> <p>Haemosiderosis probably resulted from red blood cell haemolysis. Exposures at 60 and 283 ppm produced no observed effects.</p> <p>An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed microscopically in male mice exposed to 375 ppm for 18 months. Both male and female mice exposed at 375 ppm showed enlarged livers but tumours did not occur in females.</p> <p>Repeated exposure to hydroxylamine and derivatives may result in respiratory sensitisation with asthma-like symptoms.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.
