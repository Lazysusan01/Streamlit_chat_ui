Zirconium salts have similar chemistry to aluminum salts in that they form gels on hydrolysis. They tend to be slightly more efficient than aluminum salts because of the higher acidity and greater synergistic effect of zirconium-containing complexes. Zirconium salts, however, are too expensive to use as the sole antiperspirant active but incorporation of a small amount of zirconium oxydichlorohydrate (ZrOCl2) or zirconium oxyhydroxychlorohydrate (ZrO(OH)Cl) in aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) -based antiperspirants improves their efficacy by 30- 50%. These zirconium/aluminum chlorohydrate (ZACH) salts are more acidic than ACH and therefore need to be buffered to reduce skin irritation.

These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>These chemicals, by the nature of their surfactant properties, are toxic to aquatic organisms at low concentrations. Cationic groups such as alkylsulfoniums, alkylphosphoniums and quaternary ammonium polymers are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. Similarly potentially cationic groups such as amines and isocyanates are of concern. Some cationics, however, may fall into the category of PLCs (polymers of low concern) provided they possess low charge density, and/or are not water-soluble or are not self-dispersing polycarboxylates or poly- (aromatic or aliphatic) sulfonate polymers.</p> <p>The toxicity of quaternary ammonium compounds is known to be greatly reduced in the environment because of preferential binding to dissolved organics in surface water</p> <p>Metal-containing inorganic substances generally have negligible vapour pressure and are not expected to partition to air. Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p>Speciation of arsenic is an important consideration in the fate, movement, and action of this substance. Chemical and biochemical transformations of arsenic include oxidation, reduction and methylation which affects its volatilisation, adsorption, dissolution and biological disposition. The transport of arsenic in the environment is largely controlled by absorption/desorption processes in soils and sediments. Sediment movement is responsible for transport of arsenic soil residues to their ultimate sinks in deep ocean sediments. The clay fraction, plus ferrous and aluminium oxides which coat clay particles, adsorb arsenicals which then undergo transformation as discussed earlier. Conversions of arsenic to volatile alkylarsines leads to air transport losses from soil. Inorganic arsenic occurs in water in different oxidation states depending on the pH and Eh of the water. Arsenate is apparently reduced by bacteria to arsenite in marine environments because the ratio of total arsenate to total arsenic is much lower than that predicted thermodynamically. Methylation of arsenic occurs in both freshwater and marine systems where arsenate occurs as arsenate, arsenite, methanearsonic acid and dimethylarsinic \u00a0acid. Arsenate predominates because this is the most stable form.</p> <p>\u00a0Bioaccumulation occurs in some aquatic species such as seaweeds, freshwater algae and crustaceans. Some arsenic in water flea (Daphnia Magna) and algae occurs as arseno-analogues of phospholipids leading to the mistaken impression that accumulation and utilisation of arsenic takes place at the expense of phosphate. Crabs, lobsters and other marine organisms accumulate organo-arsenicals in the food chain. Although human activity may alter the local picture of environmental arsenic there is little evidence that this affects the global scale arsenic cycle.</p> <p>\u00a0Airborne concentrations of arsenic in urban areas may range from a few nanograms to a few tenths of a microgram per cubic meter; airborne arsenic is generally inorganic. In oxygenated soils inorganic arsenic is present in pentavalent form; under reducing conditions it occurs as the trivalent form.</p> <p>Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>arsenic: 50 ug/1 (UK max.) 0.01mg/L (WHO provisional guideline)</p> <p>chloride:400 mg/l (UK max.)</p> <p>250 mg/l (WHO guideline)</p> <p>Soil Guideline:</p> <p>Dutch Criteria: 29 mg/kg (target)</p> <p>55 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p>Air Quality Standard:</p> <p>No safe levels recommended due to carcinogenic properties (WHO guideline)</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Soluble salts of zirconium are moderately\r\ntoxic to algae and fish. Zirconium is more toxic in soft water than in hard\r\nwater. The toxicity of zirconium salts and zirconium complexes with organic\r\nacids are expected to be related to their water solubilities and their octanol/\r\nwater partition coefficient (Kow). Compounds with molecular weights exceeding\r\n1000 are not expected to be absorbed by aquatic organisms even if they are\r\nwater soluble.

Many microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts) and animals are now known to biomethylate arsenic, forming both volatile (e.g., methylarsines) and nonvolatile (e.g., methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) compounds. \u00a0Antimony and bismuth, also undergo biomethylation to some extent. Trimethylstibine formation by microorganisms is now well established, but this process apparently does not occur in animals.

Aluminum in compounds has\r\nonly one oxidation state (+3), and would not undergo oxidation-reduction\r\nreactions under environmental conditions. Aluminum can be complexed by various\r\nligands present in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids). The\r\nsolubility of aluminum in the environment will depend on the ligands present\r\nand the pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ntrivalent aluminum ion is surrounded by six water molecules in solution. The\r\nhydrated aluminum ion, [Al(H2O)6]3+, undergoes hydrolysis, in which a stepwise\r\ndeprotonation of the coordinated water ligands forms bound hydroxide ligands\r\n(e.g., [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+, [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+). The speciation of aluminum in water\r\nis pH dependent. The hydrated trivalent aluminum ion is the predominant form at\r\npH levels below 4. Between pH 5 and 6, the predominant hydrolysis products are\r\nAl(OH)2+ and Al(OH)2+, while the solid Al(OH)3 is most prevalent between pH 5.2\r\nand 8.8. The soluble species Al(OH)4- is the predominant species above pH 9,\r\nand is the only species present above pH 10. Polymeric aluminum hydroxides\r\nappear between pH 4.7 and 10.5, and increase in size until they are transformed\r\ninto colloidal particles of amorphous Al(OH)3, which crystallise to gibbsite in\r\nacid waters. Polymerisation is affected by the presence of dissolved silica;\r\nwhen enough silica is present, aluminum is precipitated as poorly crystallised\r\nclay mineral species.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyaluminum\r\ncompounds are considered amphoteric (e.g., they can act as both acids and bases\r\nin solution). Because of this property, aluminum hydroxides can act as buffers\r\nand resist pH changes within the narrow pH range of 4-5.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monomeric\r\naluminum compounds, typified by aluminum fluoride, chloride, and sulfate, are\r\nconsidered reactive or labile compounds, whereas polymeric aluminum species\r\nreact much more slowly in the environment. Aluminum has a stronger attraction\r\nfor fluoride in an acidic environment compared to other inorganic ligand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nadsorption of aluminum onto clay surfaces can be a significant factor in\r\ncontrolling aluminum mobility in the environment, and these adsorption\r\nreactions, measured in one study at pH 3.0-4.1, have been observed to be very\r\nrapid. However, clays may act either as a sink or a source for soluble aluminum\r\ndepending on the degree of aluminum saturation on the clay surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Within\r\nthe pH range of 5-6, aluminum complexes with phosphate and is removed from\r\nsolution. Because phosphate is a necessary nutrient in ecological systems, this\r\nimmobilization of both aluminum and phosphate may result in depleted nutrient\r\nstates in surface water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant\r\nspecies and cultivars of the same species differ considerably in their ability\r\nto take up and translocate aluminum to above-ground parts. Tea leaves may\r\ncontain very high concentrations of aluminum, &gt;5,000 mg/kg in old leaves.\r\nOther plants that may contain high levels of aluminum include Lycopodium\r\n(Lycopodiaceae), a few ferns, Symplocos (Symplocaceae), and Orites\r\n(Proteaceae). Aluminum is often taken up and concentrated in root tissue. In\r\nsub-alpine ecosystems, the large root biomass of the Douglas fir, <i>Abies\r\namabilis</i>, takes up aluminum and immobilizes it, preventing large\r\naccumulation in above-ground tissue. It is unclear to what extent aluminum is\r\ntaken up into root food crops and leafy vegetables. An uptake factor\r\n(concentration of aluminum in the plant/concentration of aluminum in soil) of\r\n0.004 for leafy vegetables and 0.00065 for fruits and tubers has been reported,\r\nbut the pH and plant species from which these uptake factors were derived are\r\nunclear. Based upon these values, however, it is clear that aluminum is not\r\ntaken up in plants from soil, but is instead biodiluted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminum\r\nconcentrations in rainbow trout from an alum-treated lake, an untreated lake,\r\nand a hatchery were highest in gill tissue and lowest in muscle. Aluminum\r\nresidue analyses in brook trout have shown that whole-body aluminum content\r\ndecreases as the fish advance from larvae to juveniles. These results imply\r\nthat the aging larvae begin to decrease their rate of aluminum uptake, to\r\neliminate aluminum at a rate that exceeds uptake, or to maintain approximately\r\nthe same amount of aluminum while the body mass increases. The decline in\r\nwhole-body aluminum residues in juvenile brook trout may be related to growth\r\nand dilution by edible muscle tissue that accumulated less aluminum than did\r\nthe other tissues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ngreatest fraction of the gill-associated aluminum was not sorbed to the gill\r\ntissue, but to the gill mucus. It is thought that mucus appears to retard\r\naluminum transport from solution to the membrane surface, thus delaying the\r\nacute biological response of the fish. It has been reported that concentrations\r\nof aluminum in whole-body tissue of the Atlantic salmon exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of aluminum ranging from 3 ug/g (for fish exposed to 33 ug/L) to\r\n96 ug/g (for fish exposed to 264 ug/L) at pH 5.5. After 60 days of exposure,\r\nBCFs ranged from 76 to 190 and were directly related to the aluminum exposure\r\nconcentration. In acidic waters (pH 4.6-5.3) with low concentrations of calcium\r\n(0.5-1.5 mg Ca/L), labile aluminum between 25 and 75 ug/L is toxic. Because\r\naluminum is toxic to many aquatic species, it is not bioaccumulated to a\r\nsignificant degree (BCF &lt;300) in most fish and shellfish; therefore,\r\nconsumption of contaminated fish does not appear to be a significant source of\r\naluminum exposure in humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioconcentration\r\nof aluminum has also been reported for several aquatic invertebrate species.\r\nBCF values ranging from 0.13 to 0.5 in the whole-body were reported for the\r\nsnail.

Aluminium is a gill toxicant to fish, causing both\r\nionoregulatory and respiratory effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nbioavailability and toxicity of aluminium is generally greatest in acid\r\nsolutions. Aluminium in acid habitats has been observed to be toxic to fish and\r\nphytoplankton. Aluminium is generally more toxic over the pH range 4.4.5.4,\r\nwith a maximum toxicity occurring around pH 5.0.5.2. The inorganic single unit\r\naluminium species (Al(OH)2 +) is thought to be the most toxic. Under very acid\r\nconditions, the toxic effects of the high H+ concentration appear to be more\r\nimportant than the effects of low concentrations of aluminium; at approximately\r\nneutral pH values, the toxicity of aluminium is greatly reduced. The solubility\r\nof aluminium is also enhanced under alkaline conditions, due to its amphoteric\r\ncharacter, and some researchers found that the acute toxicity of aluminium\r\nincreased from pH 7 to pH 9. However, the opposite relationship was found in\r\nother studies. The uptake and toxicity of aluminium in freshwater organisms\r\ngenerally decreases with increasing water hardness under acidic, neutral and\r\nalkaline conditions. Complexing agents such as fluoride, citrate and humic\r\nsubstances reduce the availability of aluminium to organisms, resulting in\r\nlower toxicity. Silicon can also reduce aluminium toxicity to fish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking\r\nWater Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">aluminium:\r\n200 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">200 ug/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">chloride:\r\n400 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">250 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">fluoride:\r\n1.5 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">1.5 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">nitrate:\r\n50 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">50 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">sulfate:\r\n250 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil\r\nGuideline: none available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air\r\nQuality Standards: none available.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

In very high doses, aluminium can cause neurotoxicity, and is\r\nassociated with altered function of the blood-brain barrier. A small percentage\r\nof people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis,\r\ndigestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of\r\nproducts containing aluminium, such as deodorants or antacids. In those without\r\nallergies, aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals, but there is evidence of\r\nsome toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts. Although the use of\r\naluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general,\r\nexcessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive\r\nuse of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure\r\nlevels. Studies have shown that consumption of acidic foods or liquids with\r\naluminium significantly increases aluminium absorption, and maltol has been\r\nshown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nervous and osseus tissue.\r\nFurthermore, aluminium increases oestrogen-related gene expression in human breast\r\ncancer cells cultured in the laboratory These salts' estrogen-like effects have\r\nled to their classification as a metalloestrogen.Some researchers have\r\nexpressed concerns that the aluminium in antiperspirants may increase the risk\r\nof breast cancer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>After absorption, aluminium distributes to all tissues in animals\r\nand humans and accumulates in some, in particular bone. The main carrier of the\r\naluminium ion in plasma is the iron binding protein, transferrin. Aluminium can\r\nenter the brain and reach the placenta and foetus. Aluminium may persist for a\r\nvery long time in various organs and tissues before it is excreted in the\r\nurine.

However, these hypotheses remain controversial. Several compounds\r\ncontaining aluminium have the potential to produce neurotoxicity (mice, rats)\r\nand to affect the male reproductive system (dogs). In addition, after maternal\r\nexposure they have shown embryotoxicity (mice) and have affected the developing\r\nnervous system in the offspring (mice, rats).

A neurochemical\r\nmodel has been suggested linking aluminium exposure to brain disease. Aluminium\r\nconcentrates in brain regions, notably the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and\r\namygdala where it preferentially binds to large pyramid-shaped cells - it does\r\nnot bind to a substantial degree to the smaller interneurons.

Aluminium hyperphosphorylates tau\r\nin vitro. When AD tau is injected into rat brain NFT-like aggregates form but\r\nsoon degrade. Aluminium stabilises these aggregates rendering them resistant to\r\nprotease degradation. Plaque formation is also enhanced by aluminium which\r\ninduces the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein in the thread-like\r\nextensions of nerve cells (axons and dendrites).
