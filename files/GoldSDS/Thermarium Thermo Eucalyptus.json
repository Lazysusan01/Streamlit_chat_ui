Intravenous sodium thiopental, pentabarbital or amobarbital (Amytal) is effective. The drug should be injected slowly until the desired condition is reached, namely a degree of depression sufficient to prevent or stop convulsions and to keep the patient asleep, but not deep enough to depress respirations or blood pressure. Intramuscular sodium phenobarbitol may also be helpful. These drugs as well as diazepam, can be used to terminate camphor convulsions.\u00a0</li> <li>The patient should be kept under careful observation for many hours and protected from all possible stimuli. Wakefulness, muscular twitchings and increased reflex excitability are signs that warn for the need of additional barbiturate.\u00a0</li> <li>Oxygen therapy, artificial respiration, as indicated.\u00a0</li> <li>Gastric lavage (with warm water) may be performed when the patient is asleep or well pre-medicated. In the presymptomatic stage, lavage or induction of emesis should take precedence over all measures. Because of its low water solubility, pieces of camphor may remain in the stomach unless a large tube is used for lavage.\u00a0</li> <li>After the stomach is emptied, a slurry of activated charcoal and/ or a saline cathartic may be administered by mouth.\u00a0</li> <li>Avoid ingestion of oils or alcohol which may promote intestinal absorption of camphor.\u00a0</li> <li>Extracorporeal haemodialysis with a lipid dialysate or resin haemoperfusion may be indicated.\u00a0</li> <li>Laboratory data are not usually relevant, but liver and kidney tests are advisable.

The relationship between energy of decomposition and\r\nprocessing hazards has been the subject of discussion; it is suggested that\r\nvalues of energy released per unit of mass, rather than on a molar basis (J/g)\r\nbe used in the assessment. For example, in \"open vessel processes\"\r\n(with man-hole size openings, in an industrial setting), substances with\r\nexothermic decomposition energies below 500 J/g are unlikely to present a\r\ndanger, whilst those in \"closed vessel processes\" (opening is a\r\nsafety valve or bursting disk) present some danger where the decomposition\r\nenergy exceeds 150 J/g.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">BRETHERICK: Handbook of Reactive\r\nChemical Hazards, 4th Edition</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">The reaction of ozone with alkenes is believed to proceed <i>via </i>the\r\nformation of a vibrationally excited Primary Ozonide (POZ) which falls apart to\r\ngive a vibrationally excited Criegee Intermediate (CI) The CI can decompose to\r\ngive OH radicals, or be stabilised.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p>",

Particularly with regard to training of crews for tank entry; work permits; sampling of atmosphere; provision of rescue harness and protective gear as needed</p> <p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For flammable liquids and flammable gases, local exhaust ventilation or a process enclosure ventilation system may be required.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
