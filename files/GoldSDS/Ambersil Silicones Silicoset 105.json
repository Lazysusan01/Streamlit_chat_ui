Dimethylpolysiloxane (Synonym) is Food Additive 900|<p>Siloxanes, the building blocks for silicone products, are widely used chemicals. The siloxanes are characterised by a high stability, physiologic inertness and good release and lubricating properties.</p> <p>Siloxanes are chemical compounds with a backbone of alternating silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms, each silicon atom bearing one or several organic groups. Siloxanes are building blocks for silicone products or make part of other products, such as cosmetics or paint. In colloquial language the term silicones is often used synonymously with siloxanes.</p> <p>The chemical names of the compounds most often include the string \"siloxane\", but in particular in cosmetics and toiletries names including methicone are used instead, e.g. dimethicone derived from dimethyl silicone; synonymous with dimethylsiloxane. Another used synonym is poly(oxy(methylsilylene)). To add to the confusion about the terms, several</p> <p>of the compounds are designated \"silicones and siloxanes\".</p> <p>The properties of the siloxanes and the silicone products depend on the length of the Si-O backbone, the chemical groups attached to the backbone and the presence of cross-links between the backbones.\u00a0</p> <p>The silicon and oxygen atoms may be linked into cyclic or linear structures, and are described as\u00a0<i>linear siloxanes\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>cyclic siloxanes</i>. The shorter linear polysiloxanes are, like some of the cyclic siloxanes, volatile.</p> <p>In linear siloxanes the end groups determine the use of the polymer. Typical end groups are methyl, hydroxyl, vinyl or hydrogen. For example vinyl- and hydroxyterminated polysiloxanes find major application in silicone elastomers. The side groups determine together with the end-groups the properties of the siloxanes. Phenyl side groups provide e.g. oxidative stability. Aminopropyl and polyether side groups provide water solubility, whereas the presence of alkyl groups enhances water repellency and lubricity. The presence of halogens in the side chains produces very stable polymers. Very high resistance to solvents can be obtained by using trifluoropropyl side chains, whereas lubricity at high temperatures is obtained by tetrachlorophenyl side groups\u00a0</p> <p>Silicone products are grouped into silicone fluids, elastomers and resins depending on the length of the backbone, the extent of crosslinking and the type and number of organic groups attached to the silicon atoms. Silicone fluids are used for a wide range of applications, silicone elastomers are mainly used for sealants and rubbers, and resins are mainly used for paints. The most common siloxanes are polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with different modifications.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also\r\nknown as dimethylpolysiloxane or dimethicone, belongs to a group of polymeric\r\norganosilicon compounds that are commonly referred to as silicones.\u00a0 PDMS is\r\nthe most widely used silicon-based organic polymer, and is particularly known\r\nfor its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. PDMS is optically clear, and,\r\nin general, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable. It is one of several types of\r\nsilicone oil (polymerized siloxane). Its applications range from contact lenses\r\nand medical devices to elastomers; it is also present in shampoos (as\r\ndimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), caulking,\r\nlubricants and heat-resistant tiles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">PDMS is hydrophobic\u00a0 The addition\r\nof silanol (SiOH) by oxidation, renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing\r\nwater to wet it. The surface can be further functionalized by reaction with\r\ntrichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface's\r\nhydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is\r\nvacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minute.</span></p> <p>Silicones generally increase in viscosity with increasing chain length. In silicone fluids, the number of dimethylsiloxane moieties (indicated by the \"n\" in the chemical formulae) is up to 4000 .</p> <p>Silicone fluids are distinguished from common organic fluids by a number of unique properties :</p> <ul> <li>Good thermal stability (150-200 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Good low-temperature performance (&lt;-70 C);\u00a0</li> <li>Strong hydrophobicity;\u00a0</li> <li>Excellent release properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Antifriction and lubricating properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Pronounced surface activity;\u00a0</li> <li>Good dielectric properties;\u00a0</li> <li>Very good damping behaviour;\u00a0</li> <li>Good radiation resistance;\u00a0</li> <li>High solubility of gases;\u00a0</li> <li>Physiological inertness;\u00a0</li> <li>Low temperature dependence of physical properties.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Because of these properties silicone fluids are widely applied as release agents for moulding operations, medical and cosmetic applications, polishes, coolants and dielectric fluids for electrical systems, metal processing fluids and agents for foam control. The silicone fluid may be formulated into emulsions, dispersions, greases and compounds.</p>",

Fluids are available in a wide range of viscosity grades. Some highly purified grades are used as food additives, in pharmaceuticals. Fluids have a melting (pour) point, however the gums do not Physical properties vary according to viscosity: e.g.|Nominal viscosity @ 25 (cstk) 10     50     100    500    1000   100,000|specific gravity              0.940  0.962  0.968  0.970  0.971   0.977|pour point, C.                -65    -55    -55    -50    -50     -46|flash point, C.               >163   >277   >304   >322   >322    >322|Dielectric grades have been purified to optimize electrical properties.",

The polar medium is generally\r\nwater, and a polar media to which polydimethylsiloxanes become attached may be\r\ntextiles, sewage sludge, hair, algae, sediment etc. In aqueous environments,\r\npolydimethylsiloxanes are adsorbed onto sedimenting particles.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly.

Local exhaust ventilation may be required in specific circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects or irritation of the respiratory tract (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable control measures be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The low vapour pressure of silicone fluids make exposures to potentially harmful vapours unlikely. The vapours of a low molecular weight member of this family, hexamethyldisiloxane, were tolerated by guinea pigs at concentrations of 25000 ppm for 30 minutes without apparent ill-effect. Higher saturated vapour concentrations (39000-40000 ppm) produced death in 15-20 minutes; deaths appeared to occur as a result of respiratory failure as animals removed from exposure, prior to death, almost always survived. Although animal studies show that silicone fluids are removed very slowly from the lungs, their presence is not expected to produce adverse effects; exposure to aerosols is unlikely to result in damage to the health. When heated at high temperatures, the fumes and oxidation products of methyl silicones can be both irritating and produce toxic effects following inhalation.

When applied to the eyes of rabbits, silicone fluids produced transitory irritation which lasted no longer than 48 hours.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Low molecular weight silicone fluids may exhibit solvent action and may produce skin irritation.</p> <p>Excessive use or prolonged contact may lead to defatting, drying and irritation of sensitive skin</p>",

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.
