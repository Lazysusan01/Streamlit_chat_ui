Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of methyl ethyl ketone from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is also expected given the measured Henry's Law constant of 4.7x10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The volatilisation half-life of methyl ethyl ketone from silt and sandy loams was measured as 4.9 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as indicated by numerous screening tests.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: Based on Koc values, methyl ethyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 and 197, hours respectively. Biodegradation of this compound is expected based upon numerous screening tests. An estimated BCF value of 1 based on an experimental log Kow of 0.29, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, methyl ethyl ketone, which has an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C, will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase methyl ethyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is also expected to undergo photodecomposition in the atmosphere by natural sunlight. Photochemical degradation of methyl ethyl ketone by natural sunlight is expected to occur at approximately 1/5 the rate of degradation by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 1690-5640 mg/l; guppy (Lebistes reticulatus) 5700 mg/l; goldfish (Carassius auratus) &gt;5000 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 3200 mg/l; bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 4467 mg/l; mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) 5600 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h):&lt;520-1382 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (24 h): 8890 mg/l</p> <p>Brine shrimp (Artemia salina) LC50 (24 h): 1950 mg/l</p> <p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

On soil surfaces and in water, cyclohexanone is expected to be  eliminated by volatilisation, photolysis, and biodegradation. Based on  the low Koc, this material is considered to be highly mobile in soil.  Fugacity level Ib environmental modeling indicates that cyclohexanone  will partition almost exclusively to the air (31%) and water (69%). .  The low octanol/water coefficient suggests that cyclohexanone is  unlikely to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms; therefore, potential  for secondary poisoning is low.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 720-1100 mg/L</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Experimentally,  cyclohexanone has exhibited low acute toxicity towards freshwater fish  species and the microcrustacean Daphnia magna, slight acute toxicity to  algae and protozoa, and moderate acute toxicity to bacteria.</span></p> <p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water. They are unlikely to bioconcentrate or biomagnify.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Cyclohexanone vapour irritates the nose, throat and eyes at concentrations of 50 ppm.</p> <p>Histological examination of the lungs of mice that had been exposed at 4730 ppm of cyclohexanone for two hours showed congestion, oedema and focal to diffuse haemorrhage of the lung parenchyma. A 6 hour exposure of guinea pigs at 4000 ppm resulted in narcosis, hypothermia, and decreased respiration. Recovery from narcosis was slow and 3 out of 10 guinea pigs originally exposed, died within 4 days of the exposure.</p> <p>Rabbits exposed at 190 ppm for 50 daily, 6 hour exposures showed barely demonstrable degenerative changes in liver and kidney. Similar exposures at 309 ppm produced slight conjunctival irritation, at 1414 ppm lethargy and at 3082 ppm, incoordination, salivation, laboured breathing, narcosis and death.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Exposure to ketone vapours may produce nose, throat and mucous membrane irritation. High concentrations of vapour may produce central nervous system depression characterised by headache, vertigo, loss of coordination, narcosis and cardiorespiratory failure. Some ketones produce neurological disorders (polyneuropathy) characterised by bilateral symmetrical paresthesia and muscle weakness primarily in the legs and arms.</p>",

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Undiluted cyclohexanone placed in the eyes of rabbits produced marked irritation and some corneal injury</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

It has been demonstrated that three bacterial strains could grow with the anthraquinone dye Acid Blue 277:1 as a sole source of energy.\u00a0</p> <p>Algae are generally susceptible to dyes, but the inhibitory effect is thought to be related to light inhibition at high dye concentrations, rather than a direct inhibitory effect of the dyes. This effect may account for up to 50% of the inhibition observed. Virtually all dyes from all chemically distinct groups are prone to fungal oxidation but there are large differences between fungal species with respect to their catalysing power and dye selectivity. A clear relationship between dye structure and fungal dye biodegradability has not been established. Fungal degradation of aromatic structures is a secondary metabolic event that starts when nutrients (C, N and S) become limiting. Therefore, while the enzymes are optimally expressed under starving conditions, supplementation of energy substrates and nutrients are necessary for propagation of the cultures.</p> <p>Under anaerobic conditions, the transformation of anthraquinone dyes is presumably limited to reduction of quinone to hydroquinone, a reaction that reverses once the molecule is again exposed to oxygen. Some anthraquinone dyes have been observed to be removed from the water phase by formation of an insoluble pigment. under anaerobic conditions. This is in line with the observation that electrochemical reduction of an anthraquinone dye increased its adsorptive properties.</p> <p>Many dyes are visible in water at concentrations as low as 1 mg/l. Textile-processing waste waters, typically with a dye content in the range 10- 200 mg /l are therefore usually highly coloured and discharge in open waters presents an aesthetic problem. As dyes are designed to be chemically and photolytically stable, they are highly persistent in natural environments. It is thus unlikely that they, in general, will give positive results in short-term tests for aerobic biodegradability.

This is due to limited uptake; substituents may also influence the degradation rate. When the aromatic rings of the neutral dyes had substituted hydroxyl, amino, acetamido or nitro groups, the biodegradation/ mineralisation was greater than by those with unsubstituted rings.</p> <p>\u00a0In principle, the solvent and disperse dyes have the potential to be volatile, but as they are large, complex molecules they can be expected to have low vapour pressures. Volatilisation is unlikely for uncharged dyes because that the escaping tendency (fugacity) which drives volatilisation, is also the driving force behind both sorption and bioconcentration.</p> <p>The estimated log BCFs for the non-ionic dyes, i.e. disperse and solvent, indicate a potential risk of bioaccumulation. However these values are generally too high when measured experimentally.Therefore, the risk of bioaccumulation of the non-ionic azo dyes must be further validated especially in view of their large molecular sizes.\u00a0</p> <p>Many dyes are visible in water at concentrations as low as 1 mg/l.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.
