                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis of epidemiological data, the material is regarded as carcinogenic to humans. There is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>When administered by inhalation, formaldehyde induced squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal cavity in rats of both sexes. Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p>",

Volatilisation of\r\nmethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process\r\ngiven a Henry's Law constant of 4.55x10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for\r\nvolatilisation of methanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon a vapor\r\npressure of 127 mm Hg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate\r\nprocess for methanol based on half-lives of 1 and 3.2 days measured in a sandy\r\nsilt loam and sandy loam from Texas and Mississippi, respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">AQUATIC FATE: The estimated Koc indicates that methanol is not\r\nexpected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water\r\nsurfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law\r\nconstant estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake\r\nare 3 and 35 days, respectively. A BCF of less than 10 measured in fish, suggests\r\nbioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in\r\nsunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate\r\nprocess for methanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse\r\nor absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Methanol has been\r\nshown to undergo rapid biodegradation in a variety of screening studies using\r\nsewage seed and activated sludge inoculum, which suggests that biodegradation\r\nwill occur in aquatic environments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle\r\npartitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour\r\npressure, methanol is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient\r\natmosphere. Vapour-phase methanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction\r\nwith photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this\r\nreaction in air is estimated to be 17 days, calculated from its rate constant\r\nof 9.4x10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h) fathead minnow\u00a0<i>(Pimephales promelus)</i>\u00a029000\r\nmg/l; rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhyncus mykiss</i>) 19000 mg/l; bluegill (<i>Lepomis\r\nmacrochirus</i>) 15400 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (7 d): guppy 10860 mg/l (14 d): 11.5 mg/l (semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia pulex LC50 (18 h): 19500 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brine shrimp (<i>Artemia salina</i>) LC50 24 h): 1101.46-1578.84\r\nmg/l (static)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Brown shrimp (<i>Crangon crangon</i>) LC50 (96 h): 1340 mg/l\r\n(semistatic)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) LC50 (96 h): 15900 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Marine bacterium (<i>Photobacterium posphoreum</i>) LC50 (4 h):\r\n7690 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Protozoa (<i>Tetrahymena pyriformis</i>) LC50 (48 h) 18756 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",
