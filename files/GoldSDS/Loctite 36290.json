Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints. MATC values represent an approximate\r\nthreshold of chronic effects to an organism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overall these studies show that acrylic acid and the acrylic\r\nesters studied can rapidly biodegrade, have a low potential for persistence or\r\nbioaccumulation in the environment, and have low to moderate toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">C.

                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma.

Compounds with a log Pow &gt;5\r\nexhibit simple narcosis, but at lower log Pow the toxicity of acrylates is\r\ngreater than predicted for simple narcotics.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">If released to surface water, acrylic acid and the acrylic esters\r\nwould all be rapidly biodegraded while a portion would volatilise to the air.\r\nAcrylic acid was shown to rapidly biodegrade aerobically in soil (<i>t</i>1/2\r\n&lt; 1 day). Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints. MATC values represent an approximate\r\nthreshold of chronic effects to an organism.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overall these studies show that acrylic acid and the acrylic\r\nesters studied can rapidly biodegrade, have a low potential for persistence or\r\nbioaccumulation in the environment, and have low to moderate toxicity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">C.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Acrylic acid vapour has a pronounced respiratory irritation effect and gives some warning of exposure. If irritation occurs seek to reduce exposure with ventilation, other control measures or use P.P.E., otherwise evacuate area.</p> <p>The gastrointestinal tract is the major site of absorption of inhaled acrylic acid. Absorption involves dissolution in the mucous of the upper airways followed by mucociliary transport and finally ingestion. Excretion appears to take place through expiration or via the renal system.</p> <p>Exposure to irritant levels of acrylic acid decreased respiratory frequency, tidal volume and minute volume in unanaesthetised rats. In a fatal poisoning of a rat at 6000 ppm during a single 5 hour exposure autopsy revealed lung haemorrhage and degeneration of kidney tubules and liver. Rats exposed at 700 mg/m3 (238 ppm) for 4 hours/day for 5 weeks showed strong local irritation producing irreversible changes in eyes and skin, reduced body weight, increased reticulocyte counts and reduced urine concentrating capacity of the kidney. Inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and injury to gastric mucosa were also present</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material produces severe skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either:</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces severe inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant and severe inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> <li>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Acrylic acid is a definite skin sensitiser by the guinea pig maximisation test but not by the Draize method</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p>",

Volatilised acrylic acid and acrylic esters are predicted to\r\ndegrade rapidly by atmospheric photo-oxidation with estimated half-lives of 2\r\nto 24 h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mobility in soil of acrylic acid and its esters ranged from\r\n\u2018medium' to \u2018very high'. Calculated bioconcentration factors ranged from 1 to\r\n37, suggesting a low bioconcentration potential. Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%. Acrylic acid degraded rapidly to carbon\r\ndioxide in soil (<i>t</i>1/2&lt;1 day).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to classification procedures developed by the US EPA,\r\nthe acute toxicity of acrylic acid to fish and invertebrates ranged from\r\n\u2018slightly' toxic to \u2018practically non-toxic'. The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints.

OECD guideline studies indicate ready biodegradability for several glycol ethers although higher molecular weight species seem to biodegrade at a slower rate. No glycol ethers that have been tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes. Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr). When released to water, glycol ethers undergo biodegradation (typically 47-92% after 8-21 days) and have a low potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow ranges from -1.73 to +0.51).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic toxicity data indicate that the tri- and tetra ethylene glycol ethers are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p> <p><b>CARE:</b>\u00a0Use of a quantity of this material in confined space or poorly ventilated area, where rapid build up of concentrated atmosphere may occur, could require increased ventilation and/or protective gear</p>",

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of the glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decrease significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats. This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure. Ethylene glycol ethers and acetates are mainly metabolised to alkoxyacetic acids but there is also a minor pathway through ethylene glycol to oxalic acid. The main pathway of ethylene glycol ethers is associated with significant clinical or experimental health effects, but the minor pathway is also interesting because formation of urinary stones depends principally upon urinary concentration of oxalate and calcium. In one study (1) the tendency to form urinary stones was 2.4 times higher amongst silk-screen printers exposed to ethylene glycol ethers, than among office workers.

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <p>General warning: Do NOT use latex gloves!

As a practical\r\nalternative to Stille and Suzuki coupling, the rhodium-catalyzed addition of\r\ntrialkoxysilanes to carbonyl compounds has received a considerable amount of\r\nattention.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The use of silicon compounds as\r\ntransmetalation reagents has attracted much attention as a viable alternative\r\nto the popular Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions, mainly due to the\r\nformation of nontoxic byproducts and the stability of the reagents to many reaction\r\nconditions. Silicon-based coupling reactions can be carried out using aryl,\r\nheteroaryl, or alkenyl halides and alkoxysilanes in the presence of palladium\r\nor rhodium catalysts.</span></p> <p>Alkoxysilanes are a family of monomeric molecules which react with water to form, typically, an alkylpolysiloxane (alkyl orthosilicate).</p> <p>Formulators in the paint, ink, adhesives, water repellents, and other related industries require materials that resist peeling and penetration in spite of prolonged exposure to heat, cold, moisture, and chemical attack. Research into these problems resulted in the development of alkoxy functional silanes for use as adhesion promoters, crosslinkers, and hydrophobes. The ability of silane added to a coating formulation to migrate to the substrate interface and improve bonding is well known. In addition, silanes have been added to lattices and hydrolysed to form an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) polymer with improved properties. Possessing both organic and inorganic properties, these hybrid chemicals react with the polymer and mineral components (such as aluminium, zirconium etc. oxides), contained in the polymer mix, forming durable covalent bonds across the interface.</p> <p>Often the silane is subjected to hydrolysis prior to the surface treatment. Following hydrolysis, a reactive silanol group is formed, which can condense with other silanol groups, for example, those on the surface of siliceous fillers, to form siloxane linkages. An alkyl alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol is also produced and may enter the atmosphere thus compromising the health of the worker. Hydroxyl groups on the substrate surface form hydrogen bond with the silanols which in turn lose water to form a covalent, permanent ether linkage Sufficient water for hydrolysis may be available from atmospheric moisture, or on the substrate surface. In some cases, it may be necessary to add water to increase the degree of hydrolysis. although silylation of a surface is generally by an alcohol solution</p> <p>Stable condensation products are also formed with metal oxides such as those of aluminum, zirconium, tin, titanium, and nickel. Less stable bonds are formed with oxides of boron, iron, and carbon.

Volatilisation of ethyloxirane from water surfaces would be expected based on the moderate estimated Henry's Law constant. If ethyloxirane is released to soil, it is expected to have low adsorption and thus very high mobility. Volatilisation from moist soil and dry soil surfaces is expected, based on its vapour pressure. It is expected that ethyloxirane exists solely as a vapour in ambient atmosphere, based on its very high vapour pressure. Ethyloxirane may also be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition processes, considering its relatively high water solubility.</p> <p><b>Persistence:\u00a0</b>The half-life in air is about 5.6 days from the reaction of ethyloxirane with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals which indicates that this chemical meets the persistence criterion in air (half-life of = 2 days)*.</p> <p>Ethyloxirane is hydrolysable, with a half-life of 6.5 days, and biodegradable up to 100% degradation and is not expected to persist in water. A further model-predicted biodegradation half-life of 15 days in water \u00a0was obtained and used to predict the half-life of this chemical in soil and sediment by applying Boethling's extrapolation factors ( t1/2water : t1/2 soil : t1/2sediment = 1: 1: 4 ) (Boethling 1995). According to these values, it can be concluded that ethyloxirane does not meet the persistence criteria in water and soil (half-lives = 182 days) and sediments (half-life = 365 days).</p> <p>Experimental and modelled log Kow values of 0.68 and 0.86, respectively, indicate that the potential for bioaccumulation of ethyloxirane in organisms is likely to be low. Modelled bioaccumulation -factor (BAF) and bioconcentration -factor (BCF) values of 1 to 17 L/kg indicate that ethyloxirane does not meet the bioaccumulation criteria (BCF/BAF = 5000)*</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Experimental ecotoxicological data for ethyloxirane (OECD 2001) indicate low to moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms. For fish and water flea, acute LC50/EC50 values vary within a narrow range of 70-215 mg/L; for algae, toxicity values exceed 500 mg/L, while for bacteria they are close to 5000 mg/L\u00a0</p> <p><i><br /></i></p> <p><i>* Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations</i>\u00a0(Canada 2000).</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

The complexity of natural naphthenic acids in petroleum deposits poses an analytical challenge as reflected by the several techniques reported for quantitation of naphthenic acids in the environment. Little is established regarding degradation pathways of naphthenic acids and naphthenates in the aquatic environments. Published research related to the potential for microbiological degradation and adsorption to typical Athabasca Oil Sands soils reveal that naphthenic acids are likely to persist in the water column and, with prolonged exposure, accumulate in sediments. The bioavailability and persistence of naphthenic acids in contaminated waters are believed to be high. These compounds are \u00a0highly soluble and have an extremely low volatility (Henry's constant = 8.56 x 10-6 atm x m3/mol). Sorption to dissolved and particulate organic matter is limited by the polarity of dissolved naphthenates.</p> <p>The results presented indicate that some simple naphthenic acids may be biodegradable, but many compounds in this mixture appear to resist aerobic biodegradation. \u00a0The biodegradation of individual naphthenic acids decreases with increasing number of carbons (especially &gt;17) and with an increasing \u00a0 \u00a0degree of cyclisation.

In clay soil, adsorption may be\r\ndue to ion exchange at the cationic sites on clay with either simple ionic\r\ncobalt or hydrolysed ionic species such as CoOH+. Adsorption of cobalt onto\r\niron and manganese increases with pH. In addition, as pH increases, insoluble\r\nhydroxides or carbonates may form, which would also reduce cobalt mobility.\r\nConversely, sorption onto mobile colloids would enhance its mobility. In most\r\nsoils, cobalt is more mobile than lead, chromium (II), zinc, and nickel, but\r\nless mobile than cadmium. In several studies, the Kd of cobalt in a variety of\r\nsoils ranged from 0.2 to 3,800. The soil properties showing the highest\r\ncorrelation with Kd were exchangeable calcium, pH, water content, and cation\r\nexchange capacity. Organic complexing agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic\r\nacid (EDTA), which are used for decontamination operations at nuclear\r\nfacilities, greatly enhance the mobility of cobalt in soil. Other organic\r\ncomplexing agents, such as those obtained from plant decay, may also increase\r\ncobalt mobility in soil. However, both types of complexes decrease cobalt\r\nuptake by plants.

Death was reported in rats and mice exposed to 19 mg cobalt/m3 (but not 1.9 mg cobalt/m3) as cobalt sulfate over 16 days, but exposure to 11.4 mg cobalt/m3 over 13 weeks was lethal only to mice and not to rats. Exposure to 1.14 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt sulfate for 104 weeks resulted in no increase in mortality in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Inhalation of stable cobalt by humans and/or animals resulted in respiratory, cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, renal, endocrine, ocular, and body weight effects. As with exposures in humans, exposures of animals to cobalt-containing aerosols have resulted in pronounced respiratory effects. Animals exposed to aerosols of cobalt oxides and cobalt sulfate developed respiratory effects that varied in severity with exposure level and duration. A single 30-minute exposure of rats to relatively high levels (26-236 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt hydrocarbonyl) resulted in congestion, edema, and hemorrhage of the lung. Prolonged exposure (3-4 months) of rats and rabbits to mixed cobalt oxides (0.4-9 mg cobalt/m3) resulted in lesions in the alveolar region of the respiratory tract characterised histologically by nodular accumulation of Type II epithelial cells, accumulations of enlarged highly vacuolated macrophages, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis In at least one instance, the lesions appeared to regress when exposure was terminated . Guinea pigs sensitized to cobalt by repeated dermal application and then exposed to 2.4 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt chloride showed pulmonary inflammatory changes (altered BAL fluid recovery, increased neutrophils and eosinophils in the recovered BAL fluid) that were different than those in exposed animals not sensitised to cobalt. Decreased lung compliance was found in pigs exposed to 0.1 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt dust for 3 months. Lifetime exposure of hamsters to 7.9 mg cobalt/m3 as cobalt oxide resulted in emphysema. Necrosis and inflammation of the respiratory tract epithelium (nasal turbinates, larynx, trachea, bronchioles) were reported in rats exposed to 19 mg cobalt/m3 and mice exposed to 1.9 mg cobalt/m3 or greater as cobalt sulfate over 16 days.

[GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p> <p>The LD50s of naphthenic acids (a mixture of isomers of dimethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid) in mice and rats were 1770 and 1750 mg/kg, respectively. Cumulative properties of naphthenic acids were mild. The oral LD50 in male mice of commercial sodium salts of naphthenic acids was found to be 3550 mg/kg body weight. Symptoms included central nervous system depression, convulsions and respiratory arrest. For rats the oral LD50 value for commercial naphthenic acids was 3000 mg/kg, while for mixtures of dicyclohexane (a specific naphthenic acid), the oral LD50 was 1750 mg/kg.</p> <p>Exposure of Wistar rats to single or repeated oral doses of naphthenic acids produced a number of treatment-related effects, particularly in the highest dose groups. Marked reduction in food consumption was observed immediately following dosing in the high-dose group of the acute toxicity study. A similar decrease in food consumption was observed in the subchronic study, but in both cases the effect was short-lived. Appetite suppression was probably not due to direct irritation of the gastrointestinal lining, since repeated exposure did not sustain the effect in the subchronic study. In addition, there was no histopathological evidence of gastrointestinal irritation in either study. The mechanism of toxicant-induced anorexia has yet to be determined.\u00a0</p> <p>The results of the acute toxicity test suggested exposure to naphthenic acids at levels of 300 mg/kg in rats had both cardiovascular and hepatic effects. A single oral dose of 300 mg/kg produced significant cerebral hemorrhage in male rats. Vasoactive effects of naphthenic acids were also noted study by following intramuscular injection with 150 mg/kg cyclopentane naphthenic acid for 10 days; \u00a0increased vascular permeability of cerebral capillaries was seen. Such an effect could be linked to the cerebral hemorrhaging or periarteriolar necrosis/fibrosis in the heart that was apparent \u00a0following acute exposure to naphthenic acids. It is unclear why the cerebral hemorrhage was more prevalent in male than in female rats. It is unknown whether the effects of acute naphthenic acid dosing on cardiac tissue (periarteriolar necrosis/fibrosis) are attributable to parent naphthenic acids or their metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p>The clearest demonstration of a target organ in the acute toxicity test was the liver, where the inflammation of tissues around the bile duct (pericholangitis) was consistent between sexes and highly dose-dependent</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

There were no significant differences between treated and control animals in the following: survival, body weights, testes weights, numbers of animals achieving 1 or 2 viable litters or pregnancies, numbers of implantations, pre- or post-implantation losses, numbers of viable fetuses. There were no signs of toxicity either systemically or at the site of application and no macroscopic or microscopic pathological findings.</p> <p>In general, available cohort studies in humans have not reported a significant increase in total mortality as a result of cobalt exposure. Several studies have noted increased mortality rates resulting from lung cancer following occupational exposure to cobalt, either as a mixture of cobalt compounds or as hard metal, a metal alloy with a tungsten carbide and cobalt matrix. \u00a0Fatal cases of hard metal disease and cardiomyopathy believed to have resulted from occupational cobalt exposure have also been reported. However, in the majority of these and other reported occupational studies, co-exposure to other substances was common, and was unable to be corrected for in the analysis.</p> <p>The effects of chronic occupational exposure to cobalt and cobalt compounds on the respiratory system in humans are well-documented. These effects include respiratory irritation, diminished pulmonary function, wheezing, asthma, pneumonia, and fibrosis and occurred at exposure levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.893 mg cobalt/m3 (exposure from 2 to 17 years). These effects have been observed in workers employed in cobalt refineries, as well as hard metal workers, diamond polishers, and ceramic dish painters (painting with cobalt blue dye).</p> <p>Occupational asthma attributed to the inhalation of cobalt powder has been confirmed following bronchial challenge tests. Chest tightness and chronic bronchitis have been recorded in hard-metal workers exposed to cobalt. Cobalt is known to function as a hapten, resulting in the generation of antibodies against cobalt-protein complexes. Although the minimum exposure level associated with cobalt sensitisation has not been determined, sensitisation has been demonstrated in hard metal workers with work-related asthma who have experienced prolonged occupational exposure (&gt;3 years) to levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.893 mg cobalt/m3. The sensitisation phenomenon includes the production of IgE and IgA antibodies to cobalt. Exposure to inhaled cobalt chloride aerosols can precipitate an asthmatic attack in sensitised individuals believed to be the result of an allergic reaction within the lungs.</p> <p>Allergic dermatitis of an erythematous papular type may also occur following occupational exposure. Dermatitis is a common result of dermal exposure to cobalt in humans that has been verified in a large number of studies. Using patch tests and intradermal injections, it has been demonstrated that the dermatitis is probably caused by an allergic reaction to cobalt. Contact allergy was reported in 22 of 223 (9.9%) nurses who were tested with a patch test of 1.0% cobalt chloride as well as 16 of 79 (20.3%) of examined dentists. Persons with body piercings showed an increased prevalence of allergy to cobalt, with the incidence of contact allergy being proportional to number of piercings The prevalence of sensitivity to cobalt following exposure to cobalt as a component of metal implants is low, with only 3.8% of patients developing a new sensitivity to cobalt following insertion of the implant</p> <p>Exposure levels associated with the development of dermatitis have not been identified. It appears that the allergic properties of cobalt result mainly from exposure to the metal itself, rather than a salt, as it has been demonstrated that daily repeated exposure to aqueous cobalt salts did not result in hand eczema in patients known to have cobalt allergy.</p> <p>Occupational exposure to cobalt in humans has been reported to cause several effects on the nervous system, including memory loss , nerve deafness, and a decreased visual acuity. It should be noted though, that both of the studies reporting on these findings, \u00a0had small numbers of subjects, and exposure characterization was not reported.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to cobalt produces polycythaemia (increase in blood haemoglobin), increased production of cells of the bone marrow and thyroid gland, pericardial effusion and damage to the alpha cells of the pancreas. Chronic exposure to cobalt compounds may result in pericardial effusion, polycardial effusion, cardiac failure, vomiting, convulsions and thyroid enlargement.</p> <p>Chronic administration of cobaltous chloride has produced goiter, reduced thyroid activity and lowered synthesis rates and levels of cytochrome P-450, an enzymatic system responsible for chemical detoxification, in the liver. \u00a0A toxic nephritis (kidney disease) may also develop.</p> <p>Epidemic cardiomyopathy (heart disease) among heavy beer drinkers in the 1960's in Canada, the USA and Belgium has been attributed to the addition of up to 1.5 ppm of cobalt as a foam restorative and stabiliser. Other factors are probably implicated as therapeutic doses of cobalt, up to 50 mg/day (in the treatment of refractory anaemias) do not produce this effect. Inadequate protein or vitamin intake amongst heavy drinkers, or the effects of alcohol in rendering the heart more susceptible to disease may be important.</p> <p>\u00a0Single and repeated subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of cobalt powder and salts to rats may cause sarcoma at the injection site but evidence for carcinogenicity by any other route of exposure does not exist. A number of single cases of malignant tumours, mostly sarcomas, have been reported at the site of orthopedic implants containing cobalt.</p> <p>\u00a0Animals, exposed to cobalt compounds also exhibit an increase in respiration, as well as tremor and convulsion. Exposure of rats and mice to aerosols of cobalt (as cobalt sulfate) at concentrations from 0.11 to 1.14 mg cobalt/m3 for 2 years resulted in a spectrum of inflammatory, fibrotic, and proliferative lesions in the respiratory tract of male and female rats and mice. Squamous metaplasia of the larynx occurred in rats and mice at exposure concentrations of .0.11 mg cobalt/m3, with severity of the lesion increasing with increased cobalt concentration. Hyperplastic lesions of the nasal epithelium occurred in rats at concentrations of .0.11 mg cobalt/3, and in mice at concentrations of .0.38 mg cobalt/m3. Both sexes of rats had greatly increased incidences (&gt;90% incidence) of alveolar lesions at all exposure levels, including inflammatory changes, fibrosis, and metaplasia. Similar changes were seen in mice at all exposure levels, though the changes in mice were less severe.</p> <p>\u00a0Cobalt metal dust inhalations by miniature swine resulted in early marked decrease in lung compliance and increases in septal collagen. After a one-week \"sensitising period\", followed by a 10-day lapse period, further exposures resulted in wheezing produced by hypersensitivity reactions.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
