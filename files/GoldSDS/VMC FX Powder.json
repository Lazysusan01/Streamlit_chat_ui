Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media.

In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated\r\nby plants and animals.Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or\r\notherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental\r\nfate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminium\r\noccurs in the environment in the form of silicates, oxides and hydroxides,\r\ncombined with other elements such as sodium, fluorine and arsenic complexes\r\nwith organic matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acidification\r\nof soils releases aluminium as a transportable solution. Mobilisation of\r\naluminium by acid rain results in aluminium becoming available for plant\r\nuptake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As an\r\nelement, aluminum cannot be degraded in the environment, but may undergo\r\nvarious precipitation or ligand exchange reactions. Aluminum in compounds has\r\nonly one oxidation state (+3), and would not undergo oxidation-reduction\r\nreactions under environmental conditions. Aluminum can be complexed by various\r\nligands present in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids). The\r\nsolubility of aluminum in the environment will depend on the ligands present\r\nand the pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ntrivalent aluminum ion is surrounded by six water molecules in solution. The\r\nhydrated aluminum ion, [Al(H2O)6]3+, undergoes hydrolysis, in which a stepwise\r\ndeprotonation of the coordinated water ligands forms bound hydroxide ligands\r\n(e.g., [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+, [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+). The speciation of aluminum in water\r\nis pH dependent. The hydrated trivalent aluminum ion is the predominant form at\r\npH levels below 4. Between pH 5 and 6, the predominant hydrolysis products are\r\nAl(OH)2+ and Al(OH)2+, while the solid Al(OH)3 is most prevalent between pH 5.2\r\nand 8.8. The soluble species Al(OH)4- is the predominant species above pH 9,\r\nand is the only species present above pH 10. Polymeric aluminum hydroxides\r\nappear between pH 4.7 and 10.5, and increase in size until they are transformed\r\ninto colloidal particles of amorphous Al(OH)3, which crystallise to gibbsite in\r\nacid waters. Polymerisation is affected by the presence of dissolved silica;\r\nwhen enough silica is present, aluminum is precipitated as poorly crystallised\r\nclay mineral species.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyaluminum\r\ncompounds are considered amphoteric (e.g., they can act as both acids and bases\r\nin solution). Because of this property, aluminum hydroxides can act as buffers\r\nand resist pH changes within the narrow pH range of 4-5.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monomeric\r\naluminum compounds, typified by aluminum fluoride, chloride, and sulfate, are\r\nconsidered reactive or labile compounds, whereas polymeric aluminum species\r\nreact much more slowly in the environment. Aluminum has a stronger attraction\r\nfor fluoride in an acidic environment compared to other inorganic ligand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nadsorption of aluminum onto clay surfaces can be a significant factor in\r\ncontrolling aluminum mobility in the environment, and these adsorption\r\nreactions, measured in one study at pH 3.0-4.1, have been observed to be very\r\nrapid. However, clays may act either as a sink or a source for soluble aluminum\r\ndepending on the degree of aluminum saturation on the clay surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Within\r\nthe pH range of 5-6, aluminum complexes with phosphate and is removed from\r\nsolution. Because phosphate is a necessary nutrient in ecological systems, this\r\nimmobilization of both aluminum and phosphate may result in depleted nutrient\r\nstates in surface water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant\r\nspecies and cultivars of the same species differ considerably in their ability\r\nto take up and translocate aluminum to above-ground parts. Tea leaves may\r\ncontain very high concentrations of aluminum, &gt;5,000 mg/kg in old leaves.\r\nOther plants that may contain high levels of aluminum include Lycopodium\r\n(Lycopodiaceae), a few ferns, Symplocos (Symplocaceae), and Orites\r\n(Proteaceae). Aluminum is often taken up and concentrated in root tissue. In\r\nsub-alpine ecosystems, the large root biomass of the Douglas fir, <i>Abies\r\namabilis</i>, takes up aluminum and immobilizes it, preventing large\r\naccumulation in above-ground tissue. It is unclear to what extent aluminum is\r\ntaken up into root food crops and leafy vegetables. An uptake factor\r\n(concentration of aluminum in the plant/concentration of aluminum in soil) of\r\n0.004 for leafy vegetables and 0.00065 for fruits and tubers has been reported,\r\nbut the pH and plant species from which these uptake factors were derived are\r\nunclear. Based upon these values, however, it is clear that aluminum is not\r\ntaken up in plants from soil, but is instead biodiluted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminum\r\nconcentrations in rainbow trout from an alum-treated lake, an untreated lake,\r\nand a hatchery were highest in gill tissue and lowest in muscle. Aluminum\r\nresidue analyses in brook trout have shown that whole-body aluminum content\r\ndecreases as the fish advance from larvae to juveniles. These results imply\r\nthat the aging larvae begin to decrease their rate of aluminum uptake, to\r\neliminate aluminum at a rate that exceeds uptake, or to maintain approximately\r\nthe same amount of aluminum while the body mass increases. The decline in\r\nwhole-body aluminum residues in juvenile brook trout may be related to growth\r\nand dilution by edible muscle tissue that accumulated less aluminum than did\r\nthe other tissues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ngreatest fraction of the gill-associated aluminum was not sorbed to the gill\r\ntissue, but to the gill mucus. It is thought that mucus appears to retard\r\naluminum transport from solution to the membrane surface, thus delaying the\r\nacute biological response of the fish. It has been reported that concentrations\r\nof aluminum in whole-body tissue of the Atlantic salmon exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of aluminum ranging from 3 ug/g (for fish exposed to 33 ug/L) to\r\n96 ug/g (for fish exposed to 264 ug/L) at pH 5.5. After 60 days of exposure,\r\nBCFs ranged from 76 to 190 and were directly related to the aluminum exposure\r\nconcentration. In acidic waters (pH 4.6-5.3) with low concentrations of calcium\r\n(0.5-1.5 mg Ca/L), labile aluminum between 25 and 75 ug/L is toxic. Because\r\naluminum is toxic to many aquatic species, it is not bioaccumulated to a\r\nsignificant degree (BCF &lt;300) in most fish and shellfish; therefore,\r\nconsumption of contaminated fish does not appear to be a significant source of\r\naluminum exposure in humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioconcentration\r\nof aluminum has also been reported for several aquatic invertebrate species.\r\nBCF values ranging from 0.13 to 0.5 in the whole-body were reported for the\r\nsnail. Bioconcentration of aluminum has also been reported for aquatic insects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"color:black\">Freshwater\r\nspecies pH &gt;6.5</span></i></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish:\r\nAcute LC50 (48-96 h) 5 spp: 0.6 (<i>Salmo salar) - </i>106 mg/L; Chronic NOEC\r\n(8-28 d): 7 spp,NOEC, 0.034-7.1 mg/L.

Fish are generally more sensitive to aluminium than\r\naquatic invertebrates. Aluminium is a gill toxicant to fish, causing both\r\nionoregulatory and respiratory effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nbioavailability and toxicity of aluminium is generally greatest in acid\r\nsolutions. Aluminium in acid habitats has been observed to be toxic to fish and\r\nphytoplankton. Aluminium is generally more toxic over the pH range 4.4.5.4,\r\nwith a maximum toxicity occurring around pH 5.0.5.2. The inorganic single unit\r\naluminium species (Al(OH)2 +) is thought to be the most toxic. Under very acid\r\nconditions, the toxic effects of the high H+ concentration appear to be more\r\nimportant than the effects of low concentrations of aluminium; at approximately\r\nneutral pH values, the toxicity of aluminium is greatly reduced. The solubility\r\nof aluminium is also enhanced under alkaline conditions, due to its amphoteric\r\ncharacter, and some researchers found that the acute toxicity of aluminium\r\nincreased from pH 7 to pH 9. However, the opposite relationship was found in\r\nother studies. The uptake and toxicity of aluminium in freshwater organisms\r\ngenerally decreases with increasing water hardness under acidic, neutral and\r\nalkaline conditions. Complexing agents such as fluoride, citrate and humic\r\nsubstances reduce the availability of aluminium to organisms, resulting in\r\nlower toxicity. Silicon can also reduce aluminium toxicity to fish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking\r\nWater Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">aluminium:\r\n200 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">200 ug/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">chloride:\r\n400 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">250 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">fluoride:\r\n1.5 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">1.5 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">nitrate:\r\n50 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">50 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">sulfate:\r\n250 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil\r\nGuideline: none available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air\r\nQuality Standards: none available.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>For oxalic acid and oxalate salts</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>If released to soil, oxalic acid under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) will be in the form of the oxalate ion (pKa1 and pKa2 of 1.25 and 4.28, respectively) and is expected to leach in soil. Photolysis is expected to be an important fate process; the daytime persistence of oxalic acid and oxalates on soil surfaces is not expected to exceed a few hours. Based upon screening biodegradation tests, biodegradation in soil is expected to be important. No experimental data are available to determine whether the oxalate ion will adsorb to sediment or soil more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. If released to water, oxalic acid/ oxalates will not volatilise, adsorb to sediment, bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, oxidise or hydrolyse. Oxalic acid, however, may act as a leaching agent for those metals that form soluble oxalate complexes, including Al and Fe. This may result in the release of metals which may otherwise be strongly adsorbed to soils.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on an average experimental water solubility of 220,000 mg/L at 25 deg C and a regression derived equation, the BCF for oxalic acid can be estimated to be approximately 0.6 and therefore should not be expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The predominant aquatic fate processes are expected to be photolysis in surface waters and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. If released to the atmosphere, removal from air via wet deposition, dry deposition, and photolysis is likely to occur. Exposure of the general population to oxalic acid/ oxalates is expected to occur through consumption of foods in which it is naturally contained, inhalation of contaminated air, and consumption of contaminated groundwater.</p> <p>Oxalic acid is a metabolite of ethylene glycol, which in turn is a metabolite of ethylene oxide. In assessing the aggregate exposure to oxalic acid, the residues of ethylene glycol and ethylene oxide must be considered. Food uses of ethylene oxide are thought result in insignificant exposure to drinking water resources. Ethyene oxide does not persist in the environment because it is reactive and degrades by biotic and abiotic processes. Ethylene glycol also breaks down rapidly in air, soils and water and is not expected to bioaccumulate in the environment or foodstuffs. Therefore these metabolites are not expected to contribute significantly to aggregate exposure.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
