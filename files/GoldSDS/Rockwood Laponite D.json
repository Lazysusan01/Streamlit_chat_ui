Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

These may include tremor, ataxia,\r\nclonus and hyperactive reflexes. Some animal studies have shown that exposure\r\nduring pregnancy may produce birth defects. Other studies with rats, rabbits\r\nand monkeys have not shown teratogenic effects. Human data are ambiguous; it is\r\nwell established that lithium can cross the human placenta. Of 225 registered\r\npregnancies in which the mothers had received lithium (as a tranquiliser) there\r\nwere 25 instances of congenital malformation. Although pharmacological doses of\r\nlithium cannot be unequivocally designated as a human teratogen, lithium\r\ntherapy is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Prolonged exposure may produce\r\nanorexia, weight loss and emaciation.

Mania is associated with irregular\r\nincreases in protein kinase C (PKC) activity within the brain. Lithium\r\ncarbonate and sodium valproate, another drug traditionally used to treat the\r\ndisorder, act in the brain by inhibiting PKC's activity and help to produce\r\nother compounds that also inhibit the PKC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Taking lithium salts has risks\r\nand side effects. Extended use of lithium to treat various mental disorders has\r\nbeen known to lead to acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic\r\ndiabetes insipidus (NDI), also known as renal diabetes insipidus, is a form of\r\ndiabetes insipidus primarily due to pathology of the kidney. This is in\r\ncontrast to central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus, which is caused by\r\ninsufficient levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin).\r\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney\r\nto ADH, leading to a decrease in the ability of the kidney to concentrate the\r\nurine by removing free water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Lithium intoxication can affect\r\nthe central nervous system and renal system and can be lethal</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In subchronic studies, rats were\r\nexposed to 3 milliequivalents Li/kg/day (equivalent to 1450 mg for a 70 kg\r\nperson) but did not accumulate Li whilst on a high sodium diet. However when\r\nsodium was restricted, fatal kidney toxicity developed. Dogs survived daily\r\ndose of 50 mg LiCl/kg for 150 days to the termination of the experiment on a\r\nnormal sodium intake, whereas the same dose was lethal in 12 to 18 days on a\r\nlow sodium diet: 20 mg LiCl/kg/day resulted in death in 18 to 30 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Several reports have demonstrated\r\nthat lithium may impair basal ganglia activity. Lithium intoxication has been\r\nassociated, severe and persistent oculogyric crises. Oculogyric crisis (OGC) is\r\nthe name of a dystonic reaction to certain drugs or medical conditions\r\ncharacterized by a prolonged involuntary upward deviation of the eyes. The term\r\n\"oculogyric\" refers to the bilateral elevation of the visual gaze but\r\nseveral other responses are associated with the crisis. </span></p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
