Within each subcategory the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter ion may also influence the physico-chemical behaviour of these chemicals, the chemical reactivity and classification for the purpose of this assessment is not expected to be affected by the difference in counter ion.</p> <p>As ionic substances, all members of this category have extremely low vapor pressures. Calculated values are in the ranges 10-11 to 10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkyl sulfates), 4.3.10-11 to 9.10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkane sulfonates), 2.1.10-13 to 6.9.10-15 hPa (C14-18 alkene sulfonates) and 3.3.10-17 to 5.8.10-19 hPa (C14-18 hydroxy alkane sulfonates). Therefore, they decompose before reaching their theoretical boiling points.</p> <p>Measured water solubilities are available only for alkyl sulfates; they are in the range 196 000 mg/l (C12) to 300 mg/l (C16) and by factors of 50 to 300 higher than calculated values (C12: 617 mg/l, C16: 5 mg/l).</p> <p>As surfactants have a tendency to concentrate at hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundaries rather than to equilibrate between phases log Kow is not a good descriptor of surfactant hydrophobicity and only of limited predictive value for the partitioning of these compounds in the environment.</p> <p>All calculated physico-chemical properties of surfactants should be treated with caution, because the estimation models do not take into account surfactant properties. In addition, the results are doubtful for ionic substances.</p> <p>Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties the target compartment for the substances of this category is the hydrosphere. Based on the ionic structure partitioning into the atmosphere can be excluded. In water, the compounds are stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions.</p> <p>Taking into account the low BCF factors (&lt;73) that were determined for (up to) C16-alkyl sulfates, any significant bioaccumulation is not expected.</p> <p>Soil sorption increases with chain length. Strong sorption on soils would be expected for chain length C14 upwards. Sediment concentrations were between 0.0035 and 0.021 mg/kg dw indicating that accumulation in sediments is low. Under certain conditions of reduced moisture in soil, i.e. in arid or semi-arid regions, accumulation in soil cannot be excluded.</p> <p>The substances of this category are readily biodegradable. Significant biodegradation of alkyl sulfates in the raw sewage, i.e. in the sewer system before reaching the (waste-water treatment plant (WWTPs) is very likely. The substances of this category are quantitatively removed in WWTPs, mainly by biodegradation. Because of the anaerobic degradation of alkyl sulfates in sewage sludge, exposure of agricultural soils due to application of sludge as fertiliser is not expected. However, for alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates this exposure pathway cannot be excluded due to their recalcitrant or limited anaerobic degradability.</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions is anticipated to follow the same pathway as for the aerobic degradation.</p> <p>Primary and secondary AS generally undergo complete primary biodegradation within a few days followed by a rapid ultimate biodegradation. Branched AS are also degraded quite rapidly, but multiple branchings of the alkyl chain considerably reduce the rate and extent of primary biodegradation. There are numerous studies confirming the aerobic biodegradability of AS, and linear primary AS exceeds all other anionic surfactants in the rate of primary and ultimate biodegradation. Also secondary AS are normally readily biodegradable as, e.g., the oxygen uptake from biodegradation of a linear secondary C10-13 AS corresponded to 77% ThOD in 22 days. Some highly branched AS being poorly primary biodegradable may also resist ultimate biodegradation.</p> <p>Both linear and 2-alkyl-branched primary AS are degraded to a high extent under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>AS are generally considered to have a low potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:\u00a0</b>Alkane sulfonate anionics (SAS) undergo rapid primary biodegradation with Methylene Blue Active Substance (MBAS) removal higher than 90% within a few days. Removal of 96% were seen in the OECD screening test for primary biodegradation. In activated sludge simulation tests, 96% of C10-18 SAS was removed, while the parent C13-18 SAS was removed by 83-96%.</p> <p>Alkyl sulfonates are not degraded under anoxic conditions</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates:\u00a0</b>alpha-Olefine sulfonates (AOS) AOS undergo rapid primary biodegradability with methylene blue active substances ( MBAS) removal between 95 and 100% in 2 to 8 days in river water and inoculated media. The ultimate biodegradability of AOS exceeds the pass requirements in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability. \u00a0report 85% DOC removal in the modified OECD screening test, 85% ThOD in the closed bottle test, and 65-80% ThCO2 in the Sturm test. In activated sludge simulation tests, AOS was removed by 100% MBAS and 88% DOC. The alkene sulfonates and hydroxyalkane sulfonates in commercial AOS are both ultimately biodegraded as approximately 84% ThCO2 was obtained during degradation of C14, C16, and C18 within 27 days, whereas the corresponding 3-hydroxyalkane sulfonates were degraded by approximately 86% under the same conditions.</p> <p>AOS are not readily degradable under anaerobic conditions Reports indicate a range of 31% to 43% MBAS removal under anoxic conditions indicating primary biodegradation</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity is influenced by a number of parameters, the length of the alkyl chain being most important. The pH and temperature of water bodies can affect the EC/LC50 values for compounds that contain ammonium ions.</p> <p>The most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates were invertebrates, followed by fish. Algae proved to be less sensitive. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (NOEC = 0.045 mg/l).</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow - fry 10.2 mg/l; juvenile 17 mg/l; adult 22.5 mg/l; rainbow trout 4.6 mg/l (static)</p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of AS seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length. This has been shown for daphnids and for some fish species. An overall comparison of the acute toxicity between the primary and secondary AS shows only minor differences in the toxicity, although only a few studies for comparison are available.</p> <p>The available data describing the toxicity of AS towards algae indicate that the lowest EC50 values range between 1 and 10 mg/l for C12 AS</p> <p>The toxicity of AS towards invertebrates has mainly been examined in tests with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity of AS to Daphnia magna increased with increasing alkyl chain length. It has been shown that during degradation of C12 AS, the toxicity first increased to a maximum after 30 hours and then fell to almost a negligible value. The increase in toxicity was explained by the formation of the more toxic dodecanoic acid which is rapidly transformed to other and less toxic metabolites.</p> <p>Studies showed that the 24 h-LC50 values for killifish in distilled water decreased by a factor of about 10 when the alkyl chain was increased by two carbon atoms. C16 was 10 times more toxic than C14, which was about 10 times more toxic than C12 AS.</p> <p>The toxicity of AS to fish has been demonstrated to increase with increasing alkyl chain length as also seen in studies with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity on Daphnia magna has been determined for chain length C8-C14. Results were comparable to alkyl sulfates in the range between C8 and C10, while C12 and C14 are significantly less toxic. Chronic data obtained for C12 alkane sulfonate sodium and C12-alkyl sulfate sodium with the rotifer\u00a0<i>Brachionus calicyflorus</i>\u00a0similarly show that alkane sulfonates might be less toxic than alkyl sulfates. C16 and C18 alkane sulfonates are assumed to exhibit the same toxicity than alkyl sulfates of comparable chain lengths. No data are available concerning the toxicity of alkane sulfonates on fish and algae. However, a similar toxicity might be assumed because of structural and physico-chemical similarities between the three subcategories</p> <p>Whereas most correlations between AS structure and toxicity show an increasing toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length, the budding in Hydra attenuata was apparently more affected by C10 AS than by C12, C14, and C16 AS. The authors suggested that the decrease in toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length was attributable to reduced solubility in water</p> <p>Tests on the toxicity to microorganisms were only conducted with alkyl sulfates as test substances. A test on the inhibition of respiration of activated sludge resulted in an 3 h-EC50 of 135 mg/l (nominally). The lowest effect value for protozoa was obtained from a test on\u00a0<i>Uronema parduczi</i>\u00a0using C12-alkyl sulfate sodium - \u00a0the 20 h-EC5 was 0.75 mg/l.</p> <p>Experimental test results on benthic organisms in a water-sediment system are not available. However, due to sediment-water partitioning coefficients Kd &lt; 350, no significant risk for organisms in this compartment is to be expected.</p> <p>Data indicate that toxic effects on soil organisms might only be expected at high concentrations for alkyl sulfates. Toxicity of alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates can not be assessed because test results for terrestrial organisms are not available.</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates,</b>\u00a0reliable short-term tests on fish, invertebrates and algae are available. The results indicate that toxicity is increasing as the alkyl chain length increases. The lowest available effect value is the 96 h-LC50 = 0.5 mg/l, determined in tests on\u00a0<i>Oryzias latipes, Rasbora heteromorpha</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Salmo trutta</i></p> <p>Algae show toxic effects to growth when exposed 10-100 mg/l for C14-18 AOS.</p> <p>EC50 values for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>\u00a0have been determined within the range 5-50 mg/l for C14-18 AOS . Another study with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>, showed EC50 values of 16.6 mg/l for C14-16 AOS and 7.7 mg/l for C16-18 AOS.</p> <p>Studies performed with fish show that the higher homologues of AOS are more toxic than the lower ones. This has been illustrated for different fish species (LC50 (96 h) range 0.5-5.3 mg/l)</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:</b>\u00a0The toxicity of various SAS homologues was determined in tests with\u00a0<i>Chlamydomonas variabilis</i><b><i>.</i></b>\u00a0After 24 hours of exposure at 20 C, there was a tendency to an increased toxicity with increasing chain length. The EC50 values were 125 mg/l for C10.3, 74.9 mg/l for C11.2, 32.4 mg/l for C14, 15.8 mg/l for C15, 9.42 mg/l for C16, 3.93 mg/l for C17, 3.71 mg/l for C18.9, and 8.47 mg/l for C20.7.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>SIDS Initial Assessment Profile</p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Small\r\namine oxides are very hydrophilic and have an excellent water solubility and a\r\nvery poor solubility in most organic solvents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides, known as N-oxides\r\nof tertiary amines, are classified as aromatic or aliphatic, depending on\r\nwhether the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring system or not. This structural\r\ndifference accounts for the difference in chemical and physical properties\r\nbetween the two types. The higher aliphatic amine oxides are commercially\r\nimportant because of their surfactant properties and are used extensively in\r\ndetergents. Amine oxides that have surface-acting properties can be further\r\ncategorised as nonionic surfactants; however, because under acidic conditions\r\nthey show cationic properties, they have also been called cationic surfactants.\r\nMost amine oxides undergo thermal decomposition between 90 and 200\u00b0C. Aromatic\r\namine oxides, have some pharmaceutical importance, do not demonstrate\r\nsurface-acting properties and are more resistant than aliphatic amine oxides to\r\nreduction. Linear alpha-olefins are the source of the largest volume of\r\naliphatic amine oxides. Fatty alcohols and fatty acids are also used to produce\r\namine oxides. Amine oxides used in industry are prepared by oxidation of\r\ntertiary amines with hydrogen peroxide solution. Amine oxides are used in the\r\ndetergent, organic synthesis, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. Aliphatic\r\namine oxides range from practically nontoxic to slightly toxic. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxide based surfactants are\r\nantimicrobial being effective against common bacteria such as S. aureus and E.\r\ncoli.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Experimental values for\r\nmelting points of C10 to C16 amine oxides range from 125 to 136 C. Amine oxides\r\nundergo Cope elimination, i.e., the formation of an olefin and a hydroxylamine\r\nby pyrolysis of an amine oxide, in the temperature range 150-200 C, thus\r\ndecomposition is likely to occur before the melting point is reached, and all\r\nboiling points are predicted to be far above the decomposition temperature.\r\nAmine oxides are not volatile: predicted vapor pressure values are &lt; 4.6E-7\r\nhPa. Amine oxides are highly water soluble - measured values for a C12.6\r\naverage chain length is ~410 g/L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although it is impossible to accurately measure an octanol-water\r\npartition coefficient for surface-active agents like amine oxides, an\r\noctanol-water partition coefficient (Log value) of &lt; 2.7 has been calculated\r\nfor amine oxides of chain length C14 and below. The predicted atmospheric\r\noxidation half lives are of the order of 5 hours, indicating a relatively rapid\r\natmospheric degradation potential.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are removed by conventional sewage treatment systems\r\nand biodegrade under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Of the collected data,\r\nfour amine oxides meet the \u201creadily biodegradable\u201d OECD criterion, two are\r\n\u201cultimately biodegradable,\u201d and two are \u201cinherently biodegradable.\u201d These\r\nstudies are conducted on complex mixtures with a high degree of alkyl chain\r\nlength overlap. Further, biodegradation is not dependent on chain length.\r\nRemoval of amine oxides in biological wastewater treatment has been studied in\r\nlaboratory simulation studies (&gt;99.8% removal, OECD 303A study) as well as\r\nthrough monitoring activities in different geographies; the main removal\r\nmechanism can be attributed to mineralisation and an average removal number of\r\n98% can be assumed as applicable for secondary activated sludge treatment.\r\nLevel III fugacity modeling, using loading rates for air, soil, and water of\r\n1000 kg/h for each media, shows water receiving compartment receiving 99.5%;\r\nthe other compartments are negligible. The bioconcentration factor for amine\r\noxides &lt;C14, is predicted to be &lt;87, based on log Kow data, indicating low\r\npotential for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on hazard data, freshwater green algae are considered the\r\nmost sensitive species, for acute and chronic endpoints. Acute toxicity is\r\naffected by chain length for fish and invertebrates. Chain length affects\r\nhydrophobicity, wherein longer chain-lengths increase the rate of uptake and\r\ndecrease depuration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The range of acute LC50/EC50/ErC50 values based on a review of the\r\naquatic toxicity data on AO were 0.60-32 mg/L for fish, 0.50-10.8 mg/L\r\nfor\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna\u00a0</i>and 0.010-5.30 mg/L for algae. Chronic\r\ntoxicity data were normalised to a chain length of 12.9 carbon atoms, as this\r\naverage chain length represents the largest volume product for North America\r\n(CAS No 70952-80-2). Chronic toxicity (NOEC, EC20) for an amine oxide of\r\naverage chain length of C12.9 ranged as follows for the different trophic\r\nlevels: 0.010-1.72 mg/L for algae, 0.28 mg/L for Daphnia (flow through) and\r\n0.31 mg/L for fish (flow through). These are based on geometric mean values,\r\nand a dataset of 21 chronic toxicity studies. Based on a chronic periphyton\r\nmicrocosm bioassay that included 110 taxa of algae (most sensitive species), a\r\nNOEC value of 0.050 mg/L was derived when normalized for a C12.9 amine oxide.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience).

They can be\r\nused to build viscosity and boost foam over a broad pH range.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are surfactants\r\ncommonly used in consumer products such as shampoos, conditioners, detergents,\r\nand hard surface cleaners. Alkyl dimethyl amine oxide (chain lengths C10-C16)\r\nis the most commercially used amine oxide.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are used as\r\nprotecting group for amines and as chemical intermediates. Long-chain alkyl\r\namine oxides are used as amphoteric surfactants and foam stabilizers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are weak bases with\r\na pKb of around 4.5 that form R3N+-OH, cationic hydroxylamines, upon\r\nprotonation at a pH below their pKb. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are highly polar\r\nmolecules and have a polarity close to that of quaternary ammonium salts. Small\r\namine oxides are very hydrophilic and have an excellent water solubility and a\r\nvery poor solubility in most organic solvents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides, known as N-oxides\r\nof tertiary amines, are classified as aromatic or aliphatic, depending on\r\nwhether the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring system or not. This structural\r\ndifference accounts for the difference in chemical and physical properties\r\nbetween the two types. The higher aliphatic amine oxides are commercially\r\nimportant because of their surfactant properties and are used extensively in\r\ndetergents. Amine oxides that have surface-acting properties can be further\r\ncategorised as nonionic surfactants; however, because under acidic conditions\r\nthey show cationic properties, they have also been called cationic surfactants.\r\nMost amine oxides undergo thermal decomposition between 90 and 200\u00b0C. Aromatic\r\namine oxides, have some pharmaceutical importance, do not demonstrate\r\nsurface-acting properties and are more resistant than aliphatic amine oxides to\r\nreduction. Linear alpha-olefins are the source of the largest volume of\r\naliphatic amine oxides. Fatty alcohols and fatty acids are also used to produce\r\namine oxides. Amine oxides used in industry are prepared by oxidation of\r\ntertiary amines with hydrogen peroxide solution. Amine oxides are used in the\r\ndetergent, organic synthesis, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. Aliphatic\r\namine oxides range from practically nontoxic to slightly toxic. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxide based surfactants are\r\nantimicrobial being effective against common bacteria such as S. aureus and E.\r\ncoli. They are also non-denaturing and may be used to solubilise proteins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are common\r\nmetabolites of medication and psychoactive drugs. Examples include nicotine,\r\nZolmitriptan, and morphine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides of anti-cancer drugs\r\nhave been developed as prodrugs that are metabolized in the oxygen-deficient\r\ncancer tissue to the active drug</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>|Anistatic",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Experimental values for\r\nmelting points of C10 to C16 amine oxides range from 125 to 136 C. Amine oxides\r\nundergo Cope elimination, i.e., the formation of an olefin and a hydroxylamine\r\nby pyrolysis of an amine oxide, in the temperature range 150-200 C, thus\r\ndecomposition is likely to occur before the melting point is reached, and all\r\nboiling points are predicted to be far above the decomposition temperature.\r\nAmine oxides are not volatile: predicted vapor pressure values are &lt; 4.6E-7\r\nhPa. Amine oxides are highly water soluble - measured values for a C12.6\r\naverage chain length is ~410 g/L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although it is impossible to accurately measure an octanol-water\r\npartition coefficient for surface-active agents like amine oxides, an\r\noctanol-water partition coefficient (Log value) of &lt; 2.7 has been calculated\r\nfor amine oxides of chain length C14 and below. The predicted atmospheric\r\noxidation half lives are of the order of 5 hours, indicating a relatively rapid\r\natmospheric degradation potential.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are removed by conventional sewage treatment systems\r\nand biodegrade under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Of the collected data,\r\nfour amine oxides meet the \u201creadily biodegradable\u201d OECD criterion, two are\r\n\u201cultimately biodegradable,\u201d and two are \u201cinherently biodegradable.\u201d These\r\nstudies are conducted on complex mixtures with a high degree of alkyl chain\r\nlength overlap. Further, biodegradation is not dependent on chain length.\r\nRemoval of amine oxides in biological wastewater treatment has been studied in\r\nlaboratory simulation studies (&gt;99.8% removal, OECD 303A study) as well as\r\nthrough monitoring activities in different geographies; the main removal\r\nmechanism can be attributed to mineralisation and an average removal number of\r\n98% can be assumed as applicable for secondary activated sludge treatment.\r\nLevel III fugacity modeling, using loading rates for air, soil, and water of\r\n1000 kg/h for each media, shows water receiving compartment receiving 99.5%;\r\nthe other compartments are negligible. The bioconcentration factor for amine\r\noxides &lt;C14, is predicted to be &lt;87, based on log Kow data, indicating low\r\npotential for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on hazard data, freshwater green algae are considered the\r\nmost sensitive species, for acute and chronic endpoints. Acute toxicity is\r\naffected by chain length for fish and invertebrates. Chain length affects\r\nhydrophobicity, wherein longer chain-lengths increase the rate of uptake and\r\ndecrease depuration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The range of acute LC50/EC50/ErC50 values based on a review of the\r\naquatic toxicity data on AO were 0.60-32 mg/L for fish, 0.50-10.8 mg/L\r\nfor\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna\u00a0</i>and 0.010-5.30 mg/L for algae. Chronic\r\ntoxicity data were normalised to a chain length of 12.9 carbon atoms, as this\r\naverage chain length represents the largest volume product for North America\r\n(CAS No 70952-80-2). Chronic toxicity (NOEC, EC20) for an amine oxide of\r\naverage chain length of C12.9 ranged as follows for the different trophic\r\nlevels: 0.010-1.72 mg/L for algae, 0.28 mg/L for Daphnia (flow through) and\r\n0.31 mg/L for fish (flow through). These are based on geometric mean values,\r\nand a dataset of 21 chronic toxicity studies. Based on a chronic periphyton\r\nmicrocosm bioassay that included 110 taxa of algae (most sensitive species), a\r\nNOEC value of 0.050 mg/L was derived when normalized for a C12.9 amine oxide.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Nonionic surfactants may produce localised irritation of the oral or gastrointestinal mucosa and induce vomiting and mild diarrhoea.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to the product is not thought to produce chronic effects adverse to health (as classified by EC Directives using animal models); nevertheless exposure by all routes should be minimised as a matter of course.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented.

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Sequestering agents are occasionally used in therapies for various forms of poisoning and are normally injected intravenously. A systemic reaction known as the \"excessive chelation syndrome\" consists mainly of malaise, fatigue, thirst and parathesias, followed by chills and fever. Myalgia, headache, anorexia, nausea and occasionally marked urinary frequency and urgency may also occur. Minor reactions resembling those produced by histamine or the common cold are sometimes seen.</p> <p>Parenteral administration of EDTA and its salts in high doses may produce severe renal lesions with tubular necrosis, internal haemorrhage, transient bone marrow depression and life-threatening hypocalcaemia. Prolonged parenteral exposures produce electrolyte imbalance and possible cardiac arrhythmias.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may result in irritation. EDTA and its metal salts do not permeate the cellular membrane to a significant extent; they remain in the extracellular fluid until excreted. \u00a0(ILO Encyclopaedia)</p> <p>NOTE: Conflicting animal test data is available with regard to the teratogenic potential of EDTA sodium salts. \u00a0Some data indicate that teratogenic effects may occur at extremely high maternal doses.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis of epidemiological data, the material is regarded as carcinogenic to humans. There is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>When administered by inhalation, formaldehyde induced squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal cavity in rats of both sexes. Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p>",

On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years.

Negative results were obtained in studies of the DNA-damaging potential of mixed isothiazolinones (Kathon) in mammalian cells\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0and of cytogenetic effects and DNA-binding\u00a0<i>in vivo.</i>\u00a0 The addition of rat liver S-9 (metabolic activation) reduced toxicity but did not eliminate mutagenicity. These compounds bind to the proteins in the S-9. At higher concentrations of Kathon the increase in mutagenicity may be due to an excess of unbound active compounds.</p> <p>A study of cutaneous application of Kathon CG in 30 months, three times per week at a concentration of 400 ppm (0.04%) a.i. had no local or systemic tumourigenic effect in male mice. No dermal or systemic carcinogenic potential was observed.</p> <p>Reproduction and teratogenicity studies with rats, given isothiazolinone doses of 1.4-14 mg/kg/day orally from day 6 to day 15 of gestation, showed no treatment related effects in either the dams or in the foetuses</p> <p>Sensitisation may give severe responses to very low levels of exposure, in situations where exposure may occur.</p>|In guinea pigs equimolar concentrations of the 3 allergens show 5243-K-CG, and 4523-K-CG to be equally strong skin contact sensitisers. In humans, a similar strength of reactivity is apparent; reaction to 243-K-CG is unclear.|(* K-CG=Kathon CG)          [Bruze etal; Contact Dermatitis 20:219-239 1989]",
