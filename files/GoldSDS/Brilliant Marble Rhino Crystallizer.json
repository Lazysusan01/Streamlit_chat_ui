Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>formaldehyde</p> <p>acrolein\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

Although the bio-degradation and\r\nbio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several researchers,\r\nthe enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these phenomena are still\r\nunclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both enzymatic and abiotic factors\r\n(such UV light) can mediate the initial oxidation of polyethylene chains, and\r\ngiven the chemical similarity between polyethylene and olefins it has been\r\nsuggested that the metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be\r\nused once the size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range\r\nfor enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons).

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>for poly-alpha-olefins (PAOs)</p> <p>CEL TWA: 5 mg/m3 (mist); STEL 10 mg/m3 (cf TLV TWA mineral oils, pure, highly and severely refined; inhalable fraction)</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p>",

If prevention is not possible, consider protection by use of containment, venting or suppression of dust handling equipment. Where explosion venting is considered to be the most appropriate method of protection, vent areas should preferably be calculated based on Kst rather than an St value. If nitrogen purging is considered as the protective system, it must operate with an oxygen level below the limiting oxygen concentration. The system should include an oxygen monitoring and shut-down facility in the event of excessive oxygen being detected.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The maximum surface temperature of enclosures potentially exposed to this material should be based on values obtained by taking 2/3 of the minimum ignition temperature (MIE) of the dust cloud.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Non-volatile inorganic fluoride particulates are removed from the\r\natmosphere via condensation or nucleation processes. Fluorides adsorbed on\r\nparticulate matter in the atmosphere are generally stable and are not readily\r\nhydrolysed, although they may be degraded by radiation if they persist in the\r\natmosphere. Fluorine and the silicon fluorides (fluosilicates, silicofluorides)\r\nare hydrolysed in the atmosphere to form hydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen fluoride\r\nmay combine with water vapour to produce an aerosol or fog of aqueous\r\nhydrofluoric acid.\u00a0 Based upon available data, inorganic fluoride compounds,\r\nwith the exception of sulfur hexafluoride, are not expected to remain in the\r\ntroposphere for long periods or to migrate to the stratosphere. Estimates of\r\nthe residence time of sulfur hexafluoride in the atmosphere range from 500 to\r\nseveral thousand years. Fluoride in aerosols can be transported over large\r\ndistances by wind or as a result of atmospheric turbulence. The distance\r\ntravelled is determined by the deposition velocity of both the gaseous hydrogen\r\nfluoride and the fluorides in particulate form. Atmospheric fluorides may be\r\ntransported to soils and surface waters through both wet and dry deposition\r\nprocesses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluorides undergo transformations in soil and water, forming\r\ncomplexes and binding strongly to soil and sediment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In water, the transport and transformation of inorganic fluorides\r\nare influenced by pH, water hardness and the presence of ion-exchange materials\r\nsuch as clays. In natural water, fluoride forms strong complexes with aluminum\r\nin water, and fluorine chemistry in water is largely regulated by aluminum\r\nconcentration and pH. Below pH 5, fluoride is almost entirely complexed with\r\naluminum and consequently, the concentration of free F- is low. As the pH\r\nincreases, Al-OH complexes dominate over Al-F complexes and the free F- levels\r\nincrease. Fluoride forms stable complexes with calcium and magnesium, which are\r\npresent in sea water. Calcium carbonate precipitation dominates the removal of\r\ndissolved fluoride from sea water. The residence time for fluoride in ocean\r\nsediment is calculated\u00a0 to be 2-3 million years. Fluorosilicic acid and\r\nhydrofluoric acid in high aquatic concentrations such as may be found in\r\nindustrial waste ponds may volatilise, releasing silicon tetrafluoride and\r\nhydrogen fluoride into the atmosphere. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Solubilisation of inorganic fluorides from minerals may also be\r\nenhanced by the presence of ion-exchange materials (e.g., bentonite clays and\r\nhumic acid). Once dissolved, inorganic fluorides remain in solution under\r\nconditions of low pH and hardness and in the presence of ion-exchange material.\r\nSoluble inorganic fluorides may also form aerosols at the air?water interface\r\nor vaporise into the atmosphere whereas undissolved species generally undergo\r\nsedimentation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Factors that influence the mobility of inorganic fluorides in soil\r\nare pH and the formation of aluminium and calcium complexes In more acidic\r\nsoils, concentrations of inorganic fluoride were considerably higher in the\r\ndeeper horizons. The low affinity of fluorides for organic material results in\r\nleaching from the more acidic surface horizon and increased retention by clay\r\nminerals and silts in the more alkaline, deeper horizons. The maximum\r\nadsorption of fluoride to soil was reported to occur at pH 5.5.\u00a0 In acidic\r\nsoils with pH below 6, most of the fluoride is in complexes with either\r\naluminium or iron. Fluoride in alkaline soils at pH 6.5 and above is almost\r\ncompletely fixed in soils as calcium fluoride, if sufficient calcium carbonate\r\nis available. Fluoride is extremely immobile in soil, as determined by lysimeter\r\nexperiments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Populations living in areas with high fluoride levels in\r\ngroundwater may be exposed to higher levels of fluorides in their drinking\r\nwater or in beverages prepared with the water. Among these populations, outdoor\r\nlaborers, people living in hot climates, and people with polydipsia will\r\ngenerally have the greatest daily intake of fluorides because they consume\r\ngreater amounts of water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Foods characteristically high in fluoride content are certain\r\ntypes of fish and seafood (1.9-28.5 mg/kg), especially those types in which the\r\nbones are consumed, bone products such as bone meal and gelatin, and tea, which\r\ncontains approximately 0.52 mg fluoride/cup\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluoride is mainly absorbed by the body in the form of hydrogen\r\nfluoride, which has a p<i>K</i>a of 3.45.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For fluorides:</p> <p>Based on a study in which the threshold for minimum increase in bone density due to fluoride exposure was 3.38 mg/m3 (as fluoride), the present TLV-TWA has been adopted to prevent irritant effects and disabling bone changes. There is also support for the proposition that occupational exposure below the TLV will have no adverse effect on pregnant women or off-spring. IARC has classified fluorides in drinking water as Group 3 carcinogens; i.e. Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. Equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity (osteosarcoma) has been found in male rats administered sodium fluoride in drinking water. (0-175 ppm) Evidence was not found in female rats or in male or female mice.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
