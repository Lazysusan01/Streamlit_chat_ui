This is because of the lack of corroborating animal or human evidence. The material may still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion, especially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident. Present definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses producing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health). Gastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an occupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not thought to be cause for concern.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of exposure is by skin contact; lesser exposures include inhalation of fumes from hot oils, oil mists or droplets. Prolonged contact with mineral oils carries with it the risk of skin conditions such as oil folliculitis, eczematous dermatitis, pigmentation of the face (melanosis) and warts on the sole of the foot (plantar warts). With highly refined mineral oils no appreciable systemic effects appear to result through skin absorption.</p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to oil mists frequently elicits respiratory conditions, such as asthma; the provoking agent is probably an additive. High oil mist concentrations may produce lipoid pneumonia although clinical evidence is equivocal. In animals exposed to concentrations of 100 mg/m3 oil mist, for periods of 12 to 26 months, the activity of lung and serum alkaline phosphatase enzyme was raised; 5 mg/m3 oil mist did not produce this response. These enzyme changes are sensitive early indicators of lung damage. Workers exposed to vapours of mineral oil and kerosene for 5 to 35 years showed an increased prevalence of slight basal lung fibrosis.</p> <p>\u00a0Many studies have linked cancers of the skin and scrotum with mineral oil exposure. Contaminants in the form of additives and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs - as in the crude base stock) are probably responsible. PAH levels are higher in aromatic process oils/used/reclaimed motor oils. Subchronic 90-day feeding studies conducted on male and female rats on highly refined white mineral oils and waxes found that higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons (microcrystalline waxes and the higher viscosity oils) were without biological effects. Paraffin waxes and low- to mid viscosity oils produced biological effects that were inversely proportional to molecular weight, viscosity and melting point: oil-type and processing did not appear to be determinants. Biological effects were more pronounced in females than in males. Effects occurred mainly in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes and included increased organ weights, microscopic inflammatory changes, and evidence for the presence of saturated mineral hydrocarbons in affected tissues. Inflammation of the cardiac mitral valve was also observed at high doses in rats treated with paraffin waxes.</p> <p>Smith J.H., et al: Toxicologic Pathology: 24, 2, 214-230, 1996</p>",

In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur. Manganese compound found in these soils\r\nappeared to catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 075-&gt;0.4 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Symptoms of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure may include profuse salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, giddiness, headache, vertigo, amnesia, palpitations, arrhythmia, weakness, muscle cramps, confusion, sudden collapse, unconsciousness and death due to respiratory paralysis (above 300 ppm). Inhalation of (H2S) at low concentrations causes headache, dizziness and upset stomach. Higher concentrations cause olfactory fatigue, irritation to the respiratory tract, excitement, confusion, and exposure for a prolonged period may cause bronchitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Although hydrogen sulfide is extremely odourous, the \"rotten egg\" odour is not a reliable indicator for warning of exposure since odour fatigue readily occurs. Odour sensation is lost immediately at concentrations exceeding 200 ppm. Case reports suggest that toxic amounts can enter the body through a punctured ear drum, even while wearing some sorts of respiratory protection.</p> <p>\u00a0Hydrogen sulfide is primarily a respiratory toxin which inhibits the cytochrome-oxidase system and is probably more potent than hydrogen cyanide. The lifetime of hydrogen sulfide in oxygenated blood is short and sulfmethaemoglobin is rapidly detoxified by red blood cells and the liver. Most fatalities due to hydrogen sulfide intoxication occur at the scene of exposure and immediate supportive care is imperative. Ensure such contingencies are addressed as part of the site emergency plan and that operators or other employees who may become accidentally exposed, are made aware of the existence of such a plan.</p>",

Limited environmental fate data also support the grouping of bitumens/ \u00a0asphalts under one category. Bitumen/ asphalts contain complex hydrocarbon mixtures with molecular weights ranging from 500-2000 and carbon numbers predominantly higher than C25, vapor pressures are negligible. The high molecular weights and similar hydrocarbon distributions among the bitumens/ asphalts support the conclusion that the toxicity of this group, in general, is not expected to vary significantly across members.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Upon release to the environment, bitumens/ asphalts are expected to distribute similarly because of their low volatility and limited water solubility. Bitumen/ asphalts are expected to be resistant to biodegradation, and those components that are soluble in water are expected to be resistant to hydrolysis. When bitumen/ asphalts are heated to facilitate paving or roofing applications, the lighter, more volatile components are distilled into the atmosphere. They condense as they cool, forming small droplets of liquid known as bitumen or asphalt fume condensate. The majority of hydrocarbons in bitumen/ asphalts are not susceptible to direct photolysis, since they do not have functional groups that absorb sunlight greater than 290 nm. However, certain aromatic and unsaturated compound members have the potential to undergo photolysis because they absorb light in the environmental UV region. Since bitumens/ asphalts contain high molecular weight hydrocarbons, partitioning to the atmosphere is not considered to be \u00a0important.\u00a0</p> <p>When compositionally analysing bitumens/ asphalts for certain toxicity endpoints the percentage of 3- to 7-ring polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is important. The levels of 3- to 7-ring PAHs are expected to be low considering the processes used to manufacture these substances.. Fumes generated experimentally at high temperatures are more likely to contain carcinogenic PAHs than fumes generated at the lower temperatures usually seen in field samples. Therefore, generating conditions are expected to significantly affect toxicity. .</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Bitumens/ asphalts by analogy with other high molecular weight hydrocarbons are not likely to show adverse acute or chronic ecological effects in aquatic species.\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For hydrocarbons:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The lower molecular weight hydrocarbons are expected to form a\r\n&quot;slick&quot; on the surface of waters after release in calm sea\r\nconditions.

In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur. Manganese compound found in these soils\r\nappeared to catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): 075-&gt;0.4 mg/l</span></p> <p>Drinking Water Standards: hydrocarbon total: 10 ug/l (UK max.).</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Asphalt is a native mixture of hydrocarbons which occurs as an amorphous, brownish-black solid or semisolid and results from the evaporation of the lighter hydrocarbons from petroleum and partial oxidation of the residue. Petroleum asphalts (bitumens) should therefore be differentiated from coal pitch bitumens which result from the destructive distillation of coal.</i></p> <p><i>The term \"asphalt\" originally applied to \"Trinidad asphalt\" which is a mined solid and is closely related to gilsonite.</i></p> <p>\u00a0On occasion there are reports of epidemiological studies which have found an increased cancer mortality in workers exposed to heated bitumens and bitumen fumes. There are reports of significantly increased incidence of cancers of the mouth, oesophagus, rectum and lung. The bitumens, used by this cohort, are likely to have their origin in coal and should be distinguished from materials derived from the petroleum industry (the asphalts).</p> <p>Hardened bitumens/ asphalts do not normally constitute a health hazard. Mined sources of bitumens/ asphalts may present an additional hazard related to their naturally occurring content of quartz.
