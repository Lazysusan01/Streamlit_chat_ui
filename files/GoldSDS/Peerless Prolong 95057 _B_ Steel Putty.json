Cationic imidazolines  have positive charge on their imidazoline nucleus and the electrical  charge is unaffected by pH changes. Positive charge remains in acidic,  neutral and alkaline medium.

QASs generally act\r\nby disruption of the cytosolic membrane and outer lipid bilayer via replacement\r\nof bivalent ions and attachment to the membrane, followed by the incorporation\r\nof the hydrophobic side chain into the phospholipid bilayer and the creation of\r\na mixed micelle with the phospholipids, resulting ultimately in cytosol\r\nleakage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Whereas bacterial membranes are\r\ncomposed predominantly of negatively charged phospholipids, eukaryotic\r\nmembranes mostly contain zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol. Such a difference\r\nin composition is a good precondition for a selective effect against microbes,\r\nand therefore, QAS should exhibit selectivity to microorganisms over eukaryotic\r\ncells\u00a0 Indeed, selectivity is obvious even among microorganisms. Gram-positive\r\n(G+) bacteria are more sensitive than Gram-negative (G-). The increased\r\nresistance of G- is most likely a consequence of the presence of the outer\r\nmembrane layer which grants the cells stronger physicochemical protection.\r\nInterestingly, the relationship between the alkyl side-chain length and\r\nantibacterial activity is nonlinear. Optimal bioactivity is exhibited by\r\nC12-C14 chains for G+, and C14-C16 chains for G- bacteria However, the\r\nlipophilicity of the side chains seems to be a crucial factor, although the\r\nprecise mechanism of action and structure\u2013activity relationship is not yet\r\nfully understood</span></p> #28hardamin <p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazoles have been frequently discovered as a vital component of\r\nnovel and structurally diverse natural products that exhibit a wide variety of\r\nbiological activities. The exceptional range of antitumour, antiviral, and\r\nantibiotic activities, as well as their presence in peptides, or ability to\r\nbind to proteins, DNA, and RNA, has directed numerous synthetic studies and new\r\napplications of these azole heterocycles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While other azole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of\r\nbioactive natural products, the imidazole ring occurs largely in the context of\r\nthe natural amino acid histidine. In addition, the imidazole ring appears as a\r\ncomponent of unnatural cyclic peptides and is used as an ester isostere in\r\npeptidomimetic studies. However, the applications of imidazole are not limited\r\nto the realm of peptides and peptidomimetics. Imidazoles are present in the\r\nlarge family of bromopyrrole-imidazole alkaloids isolated from marine sponges\r\nbased on the common metabolite oroidin that feature significant biological\r\nactivities. The imidazole ring is also present in the pilocarpine alkaloids, as\r\nwell as potential therapeutic agents for thrombosis, cancer, and inflammatory\r\ndiseases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Various compounds that possess an imidazoline or guanidinium\r\nmoiety, along with a number of chemically related compounds, elicit a variety\r\nof pharmacological effects on cardiovascular/cerebrovascular function,\r\nmetabolism, insulin secretion and ion transport. These compounds include the\r\nalpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, mixed alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist/alpha2-adrenoceptor\r\nantagonists and an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist and an ion transport\r\ninhibitor and other structurally related ligands. Although such ligands\r\ninteract with known receptor systems, some of their functional effects, such as\r\ntheir centrally-mediated effects on blood pressure and their ability to augment\r\nglucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, are\r\npharmacologically ill-defined. Indeed, several studies indicate that these\r\nmolecules interact with distinct imidazoline binding sites. These sites share\r\nthe common property of not recognizing endogenous agonists for known monoamine\r\nreceptors and exhibiting high affinity for selected compounds containing an\r\nimidazoline, guanidinium or structurally-related substituent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most bio-active derivatives bear a substituent (aryl or alkyl\r\ngroup) on the carbon between the nitrogen centres.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of substituted imidazoles are selective inhibitors of\r\nnitric oxide synthase, which makes them interesting drug targets in\r\ninflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system.\r\nOther biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the\r\ndownregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with\r\ntranslation initiation</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolines are biologically active pharmacophores and synthetic\r\nintermediates in medicinal chemistry. Imidazolines are also used as chiral\r\ncatalysts, chiral auxiliaries, and ligands for asymmetric catalysis.\r\n2-imidazolines have been investigated as antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory,\r\nantihypertensive, antihypercholesterolemic, and antidepressant reagents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolines exhibit a range of biological activities including\r\nantihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, anticancer, and\r\nantihypercholesterolemic agents, as well as antiulcer, antiviral, antifungal,\r\nantibacterial, antitubercular, antiasthmatic, anti-diabetic and antiprotozoal\r\nactivities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Salts of imidazole where the imidazole ring is the cation are\r\nknown as imidazolium salts (for example, imidazolium chloride or nitrate).\r\nThese salts are formed from the protonation or substitution at nitrogen of\r\nimidazole. These salts have been used as ionic liquids and precursors to stable\r\ncarbenes. Salts where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known;\r\nthese salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate,\r\nNaC3H3N2)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolate (C3H3N-2) is the conjugate base of imidazole. It is a\r\nnucleophile and a strong base. The free anion has C2v symmetry. Imidazole has a\r\npKa of 14.05 so the deprotonation of imidazole (C3H3N2H) requires a strong\r\nbase.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolate is a common bridging ligand in coordination chemistry.\r\nIn the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, the metals are interconnected via\r\nimidazolates.</span></p> <p>Polyamide adducts provide good compatibility (without induction period) and better cure under adverse conditions than standard polyamides. Modified polyamides can offer faster cure speed, lower viscosity and improved chemical resistance<br />Polyalkylenepolyamines are among the most known and widely used classes of epoxy resin curing agent; ethylene polyamines include ethylene diamine (EDA), diethylene triamine (DETA), triethylene tetramine (TETA) tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) and polyethylene polyamines (PEPA) with the general formula:<br />H2N-CH2-CH2-NH(CH2-CH20NH)nH where n=1-10<br />These compounds are glycerol-like viscous liquid that are compatible with epoxy oligomers.<br />The advantages of these curing agents are their efficiency in cold curing of epoxy oligomers and the capacity of yielding polymer materials with a complex of fairly high strength characteristics, dielectric and adhesive, and waterproof properties. Common disadvantages of these curing agents are the high volatility and toxicity which makes these compounds hazardous in actual practice. The process of curing epoxy resins with ethylene polyamines often occurs too quickly and irregularly, and is accompanied by a great exothermic effect; in the case of large indiscrete masses, this can lead to localised overheating and thus, to degradation of the strength characteristics of the polymers. In addition these amines dilute epoxy oligomers poorly, as a result of which, their use is limited to potting and impregnating compounds and other epoxy compositions that are processed in the state of viscous flow.<br />The polyethylenepolyamine adducts with nitriles, alkylene oxides, aldehydes and ketones, as well as mono-, and diepoxides, have been widely used to overcome some of the disadvantages.<br />The combination of high functionality with different nature, basicity and activity of amino groups in these curing agents must in turn provide the polyreactivity of curing systems and the complex of useful performance properties of epoxy resins<br />Key Words<br />ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA) tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) and polyethylenepolyamines (PEPA)</p>",

Many fatty acid amides are essentially insoluble in\r\nwater. Amides have a strong tendency to reduce friction on various surfaces by\r\nforming a layer on surfaces.

Alkanolamides are made from triglycerides or fatty acid methyl\r\nesters reacted with monoethanolamine or diethanolamine that then can be\r\nethoxylated with ethylene oxide under basic catalyses.

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for imidazoline surfactants:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Due to intrinsic properties of\r\namine containing cationic surfactants river water ecotoxicity tests deliver\r\nmore reproducible test results with limited uncertainty.

Certain data indicates that these surfactants do not pass the criteria for ready biodegradability, whereas the opposite is the case for data obtained from Akzo Nobel</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The anaerobic biodegradability of FAA has been examined for cocoamide MEA by using the ECETOC screening test. Ultimate anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamide MEA reached 79% of the theoretical gas production, ThGP, during incubation of diluted digested sludge for 42 days at 35 degree C . By use of the ISO 11734 screening test, which corresponds to the ECETOC method, the ultimate anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamide MEA attained 81% during 56 days</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0No experimental data describing the bioaccumulation potential of fatty acid amides were found in the literature</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The aquatic toxicity of FAA has been determined for species representing the three trophic levels algae, invertebrates, and fish.

Low molecular weight QACs are very soluble in water, but slightly or not at all soluble in solvents such as ether, petrol and benzene.

Only sparse data are available concerning stability, solubility and biodegradability. In general, it seems that the biodegradability decreases with increasing numbers of alkyl chains: R(CH3)3N+ &gt; R2(CH3)2N+ &gt; R3(CH3)N+ . Within each category the biodegradability seems inversely proportional to the alkyl chain length.

The estimated value of log Kows-range from 3.67 to 1.8 is consistent with the available experimental water solubilities. Vapour pressures range from 1.1x 10-6 hPa to 0.31 hPa. Estimated and experimental pKbs are in a relatively narrow range of 9.68 to 10.7.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Members of this cluster are expected to have varying degrees of mobility in the soil. Low vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constants suggest that these compounds are not expected to be in the vapor phase. Modeling suggests that all members of this cluster are likely to react rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radials with half-lives on the order of an hour, but with little material in the vapor phase, it is not expected to be a predominant removal pathway for these chemicals. Experimental data and results from estimation models indicate that all members of this cluster have the potential to biodegrade aerobically under environmental conditions. Fugacity models indicate that the members of this cluster are likely to partition predominately to soil and water. All chemicals in this cluster are expected to have low environmental persistence. Measured and estimated bioconcentration factors for members of this cluster indicate a low potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Evaluation of the available experimental and estimated aquatic toxicity data indicate acute toxicity to fish \u00a0is low. Daphnia aquatic toxicity is generally low.

The lowest acute EC/LC50 values of TEPA in fish (96 hr), invertebrates (48 hr) and algae (72 hr) are 310 mg/L, 14.6 mg/L and 2.1 mg/L, respectively.</p> <p>TEPA is not biodegradable (&lt;10% after 28 days) and it should be noted that complexes of TEPA are expected to biodegrade even slower. However, TEPA is not expected to bioconcentrate due to its estimated low log Kow of -3.16 and high water solubility. It should be noted that TEPA is protonated at environmental pH and the log Kow is not a good indicator of the chemical's sorption behavior.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Based on a measured vapor pressure of 8 x 10-7 mm Hg, TEPA may exist in both the particulate and vapor phases in the ambient atmosphere. The hydroxy radical atmospheric halflife is estimated to be 24 minutes.</p> <p><b>Stability in water:\u00a0</b>Hydrolysis of TEPA would not be expected under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9) since the molecule does not contain functional groups susceptible to hydrolysis. This assessment is supported by computerised estimations of hydrolysis rates based on structure activity relationships, which predict no reaction.</p> <p><b>Stability in soil:\u00a0</b>Based on an estimated Koc value of 1098, TEPA is highly mobile in soil and leaching may occur.</p> <p>However, TEPA will exist primarily as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) and no experimental data are available which suggest whether it will adsorb to soil more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. However, for polar or ionisable compounds such as TEPA, chemical sorption to soil/sediment can involve other mechanisms. For example, studies with the lower molecular weight ethylenediamine, EDA, have shown that interaction of protonated amines and negatively charged soil was possible. Volatilisation from moist soils is not expected based upon a low Henry's Law constant. In addition, there is no data available to indicate that biodegradation is an important removal process in the terrestrial compartment.</p> <p><b>Transport Between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The Level III Fugacity Model calculations were determined using four simulations: one with 1000 kg/hour emitted to air only, one with 1000 kg/hour emitted to water only, one with 1000 kg/hour emitted to soil only, and one using the default emissions of equal amount to soil, air and water (1000 kg/hour for each). Using the default emissions of equal amount to soil, air and water (1000 kg/hour for each) the percentages of TEPA in water, air and soil are estimated to be 45, &lt;0.1 and 55%, respectively (EPA 2000).</p> <p>The fugacity model predictions for partitioning of TEPA into the soil/sediment compartment is a function of the Kow and water solubility, which is reasonable for most non-polar organic species. However, for polar or ionisable compounds such as TEPA, chemical sorption to soil/sediment can involve other mechanisms. For example, studies with the lower molecular weight ethylenediamine,\u00a0EDA, have shown that interaction of protonated amines and negatively charged soil was possible. Thus, the fugacity model predictions likely underestimate the adsorption capacity of EDA to soil and sediment.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>In a Closed Bottle Test , TEPA did not biodegrade after 28 days. In the Die-Away Test, TEPA biodegraded less than 10% after 28 days and did not biodegrade at 43 or 49 days.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Amine adducts have much reduced volatility and are less irritating to the skin and eyes than amine hardeners.

Nitrogen oxides are the most probable nitrosating agents. Nitrosyl chloride, nitrite esters, metal nitrites and nitroso compounds may also be involved.

This process yields the entire family of ethyleneamines: ethylenediamine, piperazine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine and aminoethylpiperazine. These polyamines are produced as their hydrochloride salts, and must be neutralised, typically with aqueous caustic soda, to obtain the free amines. The by-product salt produced in the neutralisation step is separated and the individual products are isolated by fractional distillation. The commercial product contains trace amounts of the other ethyleneamines.</p> <p>The ethyleneamines may be used in a number of production processes:</p> <ul> <li>The reaction with polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride yields the corresponding polybutenylsuccinimides, which are ashless, dispersant- detergent additives for motor oil.\u00a0</li> <li>Polyamide -epichlorohydrin resins are produced by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with a polyamide, such as those formed by polymerisation of adipic acid and TETA.

Soils with increased CEC and organic content exhibited higher affinities for these amines. This dependence of adsorption on CEC and organic content is most likely due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amine and the negatively charged soil surface.</p> <p>For alkyl polyamines:</p> <p>All members of this cluster are miscible or soluble in water. The estimated value of log Kows-range from 3.67 to 1.8 is consistent with the available experimental water solubilities. Vapour pressures range from 1.1x 10-6 hPa to 0.31 hPa. Estimated and experimental pKbs are in a relatively narrow range of 9.68 to 10.7.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Members of this cluster are expected to have varying degrees of mobility in the soil. Low vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constants suggest that these compounds are not expected to be in the vapor phase. Modeling suggests that all members of this cluster are likely to react rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radials with half-lives on the order of an hour, but with little material in the vapor phase, it is not expected to be a predominant removal pathway for these chemicals. Experimental data and results from estimation models indicate that all members of this cluster have the potential to biodegrade aerobically under environmental conditions. Fugacity models indicate that the members of this cluster are likely to partition predominately to soil and water. All chemicals in this cluster are expected to have low environmental persistence. Measured and estimated bioconcentration factors for members of this cluster indicate a low potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Evaluation of the available experimental and estimated aquatic toxicity data indicate acute toxicity to fish \u00a0is low. Daphnia aquatic toxicity is generally low. Algae appear to be the most sensitive organism with several members of the cluster having measured or estimated toxicity values indicative of moderate toxicity. Chronic toxicity for all cluster members is estimated; it is generally low for fish and algae, but high for daphnia.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for triethylenetetramine (TETA):</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">TETA is completely miscible with water forming an alkaline\r\nsolution (pH 10 at 10 g/l). The technical product has a vapour pressure of ca.\r\n1 Pa at 20 C. The calculated Log Pow (unprotonated form) amounts to ca. -1.4\r\nand indicates a low potential for bioaccumulation. There are no measured Koc\r\n-values available. For ethylenediamine (CAS Nr. 107- 15-3) and\r\ndiethylenetriamine (CAS Nr. 111-40- 0), Koc -values of 4766 and 19111 were\r\nmeasured respectively.

The lowest acute EC/LC50 values of TEPA in fish (96 hr), invertebrates (48 hr) and algae (72 hr) are 310 mg/L, 14.6 mg/L and 2.1 mg/L, respectively.</p> <p>TEPA is not biodegradable (&lt;10% after 28 days) and it should be noted that complexes of TEPA are expected to biodegrade even slower. However, TEPA is not expected to bioconcentrate due to its estimated low log Kow of -3.16 and high water solubility. It should be noted that TEPA is protonated at environmental pH and the log Kow is not a good indicator of the chemical's sorption behavior.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Based on a measured vapor pressure of 8 x 10-7 mm Hg, TEPA may exist in both the particulate and vapor phases in the ambient atmosphere. The hydroxy radical atmospheric halflife is estimated to be 24 minutes.</p> <p><b>Stability in water:\u00a0</b>Hydrolysis of TEPA would not be expected under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9) since the molecule does not contain functional groups susceptible to hydrolysis. This assessment is supported by computerised estimations of hydrolysis rates based on structure activity relationships, which predict no reaction.</p> <p><b>Stability in soil:\u00a0</b>Based on an estimated Koc value of 1098, TEPA is highly mobile in soil and leaching may occur.</p> <p>However, TEPA will exist primarily as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) and no experimental data are available which suggest whether it will adsorb to soil more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. However, for polar or ionisable compounds such as TEPA, chemical sorption to soil/sediment can involve other mechanisms. For example, studies with the lower molecular weight ethylenediamine, EDA, have shown that interaction of protonated amines and negatively charged soil was possible. Volatilisation from moist soils is not expected based upon a low Henry's Law constant. In addition, there is no data available to indicate that biodegradation is an important removal process in the terrestrial compartment.</p> <p><b>Transport Between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The Level III Fugacity Model calculations were determined using four simulations: one with 1000 kg/hour emitted to air only, one with 1000 kg/hour emitted to water only, one with 1000 kg/hour emitted to soil only, and one using the default emissions of equal amount to soil, air and water (1000 kg/hour for each). Using the default emissions of equal amount to soil, air and water (1000 kg/hour for each) the percentages of TEPA in water, air and soil are estimated to be 45, &lt;0.1 and 55%, respectively (EPA 2000).</p> <p>The fugacity model predictions for partitioning of TEPA into the soil/sediment compartment is a function of the Kow and water solubility, which is reasonable for most non-polar organic species. However, for polar or ionisable compounds such as TEPA, chemical sorption to soil/sediment can involve other mechanisms. For example, studies with the lower molecular weight ethylenediamine,\u00a0EDA, have shown that interaction of protonated amines and negatively charged soil was possible. Thus, the fugacity model predictions likely underestimate the adsorption capacity of EDA to soil and sediment.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>In a Closed Bottle Test , TEPA did not biodegrade after 28 days. In the Die-Away Test, TEPA biodegraded less than 10% after 28 days and did not biodegrade at 43 or 49 days. Since TEPA can chelate metals, biodegradation of complexes with metals would be expected to be slower than for the substance alone.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h):\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>\u00a0310 \u00a0mg/l;\u00a0<i>Poecilia retiiculata</i>\u00a0420 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna EC50 (48 h): 14.6 mg/l\u00a0</p> <p>Algae EC50 (72 h):<i>\u00a0Selenastrum capricornutum</i>\u00a02.1 mg/l</p> <p>Bacteria EC50 (2 h): 97 mg/l; (17 h): 186 mg/l; (1 h): 1600 mg/l</p> <p>The lower EC50 values for algae compared to Daphnia and fish, may be due to a nutritional deficiency.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

The formation of nitrosamines from such amines has not only been observed in animals models but, at least for certain compounds, in the workplace. The amine-containing substances and end products handled at work can themselves be contaminated to a degree with corresponding nitrosamines. Under conditions encountered in practice nitrosation is to be expected with secondary amines and to a limited extent with primary and tertiary amines. Nitrogen oxides are the most probable nitrosating agents. Nitrosyl chloride, nitrite esters, metal nitrites and nitroso compounds may also be involved. Several factors such as pH, temperature, catalysts and inhibitors influence the extent of nitrosation. Two precautionary measures are therefore necessary when handling amines at the workplace.</p> <ul> <li>Simultaneous exposure to nitrosating agents should be reduced to minimum. This can be out into practice by eliminating nitrosating agents or, if they play a role in the actual process, replacing them with substances that do not lead to the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines.

The mechanism of this organotrophy cannot be explained sufficiently. The high oesophageal epithelium metabolic activation of nitrosamines, together with a comparatively low DNA repair, probably plays the most important role. In addition chronic stress factors, which lead to high stimulation of epithelial turnover, are a pacemaker for malignant progression. In some countries, the traditional consumption of extremely hot drinks leads to constant burns of the oesophagus, which increases the risk. Mate, a non-alcoholic brew, frequently consumed as tea in Uruguay, appears to be a high risk factor for oesophageal cancer</p>",
