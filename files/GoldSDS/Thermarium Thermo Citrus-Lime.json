Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Fragrance substance with is an established contact allergen in\r\nhumans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety SCCS OPINION on Fragrance\r\nallergens in cosmetic products 2012</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>IFRA Restricted Fragrance Substance</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) Standards form the\r\nbasis for the globally accepted and recognized risk management system for the\r\nsafe use of fragrance ingredients and are part of the IFRA Code of Practice.\r\nThis is the self-regulating system of the industry, based on risk assessments\r\ncarried out by an independent Expert Panel.</span></p> #The RIFM Expert Panel reviewed the critical effect data for citral and based on the weight of evidence established the No Expected Sensitization Induction Level (NESIL) as 1400 ug/cm2.They recommend the limits for the 11 different product categories, which are the acceptable use levels of citral in the various product categories.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of quantities of liquid mist may be extremely hazardous, even lethal due to spasm, extreme irritation of larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the simple aldehydes may result in central nervous system effects including headache, vertigo, seizures, depression and coma. Cardiovascular involvement may result in tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse and hypotension whilst respiratory tract involvement may result in irritation, upper airway oedema and laryngospasm, cough, dysphagia, pulmonary oedema, bronchial constriction, and asthma-like reactive airway disease. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting (haematemesis), diarrhoea, severe mucosal necrosis and abdominal pain. Massive exposures may produce kidney and liver damage. Animals exposed to aldehyde vapours often show damage to the respiratory tract and pulmonary oedema. Multiple haemorrhages and alveolar exudate may also be present. In general, the aldehydes appear to be free of the actions that lead to cumulative organic damage to tissues. Intolerable irritant properties of these compounds preclude substantial worker exposure under normal conditions although these products may cause olfactory fatigue at lower concentrations and therefore may not provide adequate warning of overexposure based on smell alone. Rapid metabolic conversion to innocuous compounds probably limits those critical reactions necessary to initiate or promote tumourigenesis, although tissue irritation even at low exposure may promote tumour formation by other compounds. Caution is therefore mandatory. Development of short-term tolerance to aldehyde vapours has been reported. This may be related to reaction with catecholamines leading to depletion of the catecholamine stores in the smooth muscle of the respiratory tract. Such depletion may cause the sensory nerve endings of the upper respiratory tract to exhibit reduced activity thus lessening the initial respiratory distress. Although a number of aldehydes produce narcosis, this effect is rarely observed because the irritation that accompanies exposure generally serves as a sufficient warning property.</p>",
