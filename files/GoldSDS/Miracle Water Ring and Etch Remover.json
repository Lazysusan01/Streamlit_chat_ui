Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>For oxalic acid and oxalate salts</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>If released to soil, oxalic acid under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) will be in the form of the oxalate ion (pKa1 and pKa2 of 1.25 and 4.28, respectively) and is expected to leach in soil. Photolysis is expected to be an important fate process; the daytime persistence of oxalic acid and oxalates on soil surfaces is not expected to exceed a few hours. Based upon screening biodegradation tests, biodegradation in soil is expected to be important. No experimental data are available to determine whether the oxalate ion will adsorb to sediment or soil more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. If released to water, oxalic acid/ oxalates will not volatilise, adsorb to sediment, bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, oxidise or hydrolyse. Oxalic acid, however, may act as a leaching agent for those metals that form soluble oxalate complexes, including Al and Fe. This may result in the release of metals which may otherwise be strongly adsorbed to soils.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on an average experimental water solubility of 220,000 mg/L at 25 deg C and a regression derived equation, the BCF for oxalic acid can be estimated to be approximately 0.6 and therefore should not be expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The predominant aquatic fate processes are expected to be photolysis in surface waters and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. If released to the atmosphere, removal from air via wet deposition, dry deposition, and photolysis is likely to occur. Exposure of the general population to oxalic acid/ oxalates is expected to occur through consumption of foods in which it is naturally contained, inhalation of contaminated air, and consumption of contaminated groundwater.</p> <p>Oxalic acid is a metabolite of ethylene glycol, which in turn is a metabolite of ethylene oxide. In assessing the aggregate exposure to oxalic acid, the residues of ethylene glycol and ethylene oxide must be considered. Food uses of ethylene oxide are thought result in insignificant exposure to drinking water resources. Ethyene oxide does not persist in the environment because it is reactive and degrades by biotic and abiotic processes. Ethylene glycol also breaks down rapidly in air, soils and water and is not expected to bioaccumulate in the environment or foodstuffs. Therefore these metabolites are not expected to contribute significantly to aggregate exposure.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Systemic poisoning is described under \"Swallowed\".|512r20d<p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of soluble oxalates produces irritation of the respiratory tract. Systemic effects may include protein in the urine (albuminuria), ulceration of the mucous membranes, headaches, nervousness, cough, vomiting, emaciation, back pain (due to kidney injury) and weakness.</p> <p>Inhalation of soluble oxalates over a long period of time might result in weight loss and respiratory tract inflammation.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause severe eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Oxalate ion is an irritant and may cause dermatitis. Following contact skin lesions may develop. Epithelial cracking and slow-healing ulceration may follow.They fingers may appears cyanotic.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Soluble or solubilised oxalates act as severe corrosive agents within the alimentary tract and may be lethal as a result of severe gastroenteritis and secondary shock. Ingestion of concentrated solutions has produced severe gastrointestinal irritation, haematemesis (blood in the vomitus), central nervous system and cardiac depression and death. Dilute solutions produce little gastrointestinal distress but may produce weakness, muscular twitching, and on occasion, coma and death.Where gastrointestinal symptoms are absent (as is the case with dilute solutions) systemic effects may dominate resulting in cramps and central nervous system depression.</p> <p>Neuromuscular effects are the result of the calcium-complexing action of oxalate and the subsequent depression of body fluid calcium ion. This form of hypocalcaemia is thought to produce severe disturbances in heart and brain function. Calcium oxalate also deposits in the soft tissues of the kidney and liver and may result in renal damage with the development of lesions and mechanical injury.</p> <p>Symptoms of poisoning may include vomiting (often bloody with coffee-ground appearance), pain, weak, irregular pulse, headache, muscular cramp, tetany and, sometimes, convulsion, stupor and coma. Oliguria, albuminuria and haematuria may persist for several weeks as a result of kidney damage.</p> <p>The mean lethal dose of soluble oxalates in adults is estimated to be 10-30 grams (143-428 mg/kg) with death within a few hours or even minutes.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for human fertility, on the basis that similar materials provide some evidence of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to oxalates may result in circulatory failure or nervous system irregularities may follow prolonged calcium metabolism due to oxalation. Sharp reduction of serum calcium, following exposure, can cause dysfunction of head and brain. \u00a0Calcium may be deposited in the liver and kidneys leading to damage.</p> <p>Circulatory failure or nervous system irregularities may follow prolonged calcium metabolism disturbances</p> <p>Prolonged and severe exposure can cause chronic cough, albuminuria, vomiting, pain in the back and gradual emaciation and weakness. Prolonged or repeated overexposure may result in delayed liver and/or kidney damage.</p> <p>Certain rare individuals are subject to oxalosis (deposition of oxalates in the kidneys) and are unusually reactive to any exposure.</p> <p>Rats administered oxalic acid at 2.5 and 5% in the diet for 70 days developed depressed thyroid function and weight loss. A study of railroad car cleaners in Norway who were heavily exposed to oxalic acid solutions and vapors revealed a 53% prevalence of urolithiasis (the formation of urinary stones), compared to a rate of 12% among unexposed workers from the same company.</p> <p>In a multigeneration study in mice, toxic effects in pups were seen only at maternally toxic doses.</p> <p>Oxalic acid is negative for genotoxicity in reverse mutation assays.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Non-volatile inorganic fluoride particulates are removed from the\r\natmosphere via condensation or nucleation processes. Fluorides adsorbed on\r\nparticulate matter in the atmosphere are generally stable and are not readily\r\nhydrolysed, although they may be degraded by radiation if they persist in the\r\natmosphere. Fluorine and the silicon fluorides (fluosilicates, silicofluorides)\r\nare hydrolysed in the atmosphere to form hydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen fluoride\r\nmay combine with water vapour to produce an aerosol or fog of aqueous\r\nhydrofluoric acid.\u00a0 Based upon available data, inorganic fluoride compounds,\r\nwith the exception of sulfur hexafluoride, are not expected to remain in the\r\ntroposphere for long periods or to migrate to the stratosphere. Estimates of\r\nthe residence time of sulfur hexafluoride in the atmosphere range from 500 to\r\nseveral thousand years. Fluoride in aerosols can be transported over large\r\ndistances by wind or as a result of atmospheric turbulence. The distance\r\ntravelled is determined by the deposition velocity of both the gaseous hydrogen\r\nfluoride and the fluorides in particulate form. Atmospheric fluorides may be\r\ntransported to soils and surface waters through both wet and dry deposition\r\nprocesses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluorides undergo transformations in soil and water, forming\r\ncomplexes and binding strongly to soil and sediment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In water, the transport and transformation of inorganic fluorides\r\nare influenced by pH, water hardness and the presence of ion-exchange materials\r\nsuch as clays. In natural water, fluoride forms strong complexes with aluminum\r\nin water, and fluorine chemistry in water is largely regulated by aluminum\r\nconcentration and pH. Below pH 5, fluoride is almost entirely complexed with\r\naluminum and consequently, the concentration of free F- is low. As the pH\r\nincreases, Al-OH complexes dominate over Al-F complexes and the free F- levels\r\nincrease. Fluoride forms stable complexes with calcium and magnesium, which are\r\npresent in sea water. Calcium carbonate precipitation dominates the removal of\r\ndissolved fluoride from sea water. The residence time for fluoride in ocean\r\nsediment is calculated\u00a0 to be 2-3 million years. Fluorosilicic acid and\r\nhydrofluoric acid in high aquatic concentrations such as may be found in\r\nindustrial waste ponds may volatilise, releasing silicon tetrafluoride and\r\nhydrogen fluoride into the atmosphere. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Solubilisation of inorganic fluorides from minerals may also be\r\nenhanced by the presence of ion-exchange materials (e.g., bentonite clays and\r\nhumic acid). Once dissolved, inorganic fluorides remain in solution under\r\nconditions of low pH and hardness and in the presence of ion-exchange material.\r\nSoluble inorganic fluorides may also form aerosols at the air?water interface\r\nor vaporise into the atmosphere whereas undissolved species generally undergo\r\nsedimentation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Factors that influence the mobility of inorganic fluorides in soil\r\nare pH and the formation of aluminium and calcium complexes In more acidic\r\nsoils, concentrations of inorganic fluoride were considerably higher in the\r\ndeeper horizons. The low affinity of fluorides for organic material results in\r\nleaching from the more acidic surface horizon and increased retention by clay\r\nminerals and silts in the more alkaline, deeper horizons. The maximum\r\nadsorption of fluoride to soil was reported to occur at pH 5.5.\u00a0 In acidic\r\nsoils with pH below 6, most of the fluoride is in complexes with either\r\naluminium or iron. Fluoride in alkaline soils at pH 6.5 and above is almost\r\ncompletely fixed in soils as calcium fluoride, if sufficient calcium carbonate\r\nis available. Fluoride is extremely immobile in soil, as determined by lysimeter\r\nexperiments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Populations living in areas with high fluoride levels in\r\ngroundwater may be exposed to higher levels of fluorides in their drinking\r\nwater or in beverages prepared with the water. Among these populations, outdoor\r\nlaborers, people living in hot climates, and people with polydipsia will\r\ngenerally have the greatest daily intake of fluorides because they consume\r\ngreater amounts of water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Foods characteristically high in fluoride content are certain\r\ntypes of fish and seafood (1.9-28.5 mg/kg), especially those types in which the\r\nbones are consumed, bone products such as bone meal and gelatin, and tea, which\r\ncontains approximately 0.52 mg fluoride/cup\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluoride is mainly absorbed by the body in the form of hydrogen\r\nfluoride, which has a p<i>K</i>a of 3.45. That is, when ionic fluoride enters\r\nthe acidic environment of the stomach lumen, it is largely converted into\r\nhydrogen fluoride.

Cardiovascular collapse is probably the principal cause of death in acute fluoride poisoning with sinus tachycardia the commonest cardiac finding and serious cardiac arrhythmias also common. Poisonings also cause major adverse effects on the brain and kidneys.</p> <p>\u00a0Toxic effects may include headache, excessive salivation, rapid movements of the eyeball (nystagmus) and dilated pupils. Convulsions may occur but lethargy, stupor and coma are more common. Renal pathology (acute congestion) has been described in human casualties.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to vapour or dust with inorganic fluorides may result in fluorosis, with rheumatic symptoms, stiff joints, mottling of tooth enamel. Other signs may include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea or constipation, weight loss, anaemia, weakness and general ill-health. Polyuria and polydipsia may also occur. Exfoliative dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, stomatitis, gastrointestinal and respiratory allergy, and on occasions, central nervous system involvement have all been described.</p> <p>Repeated human exposures to hydrogen fluoride (6 hours/day for 10-50 days) at concentrations as high as 4.7 ppm were tolerated without severe adverse reaction. At concentrations exceeding 3 ppm, researchers noted burning and irritation of the eyes and nose and burning of the skin. Three subjects who inhaled approximately 3 ppm had severe urinary excretions of 6.7-9.4 mg fluoride/day. One epidemiological study was able to demonstrate that there was no significant change in pulmonary function resulting from occupational exposure to average concentrations of 1.02 ppm hydrogen fluoride. A further study indicated a threshold for minimal increases (Grade 1) in bone density (fluorosis) at less than 3.38 mg/m3 (4.3 ppm) hydrogen fluoride. Grade 1 fluorosis resulted in no medically recognised disability. \u00a0Hydrogen fluoride readily penetrates the skin and causes decalcification and corrosion of the bone and underlying tissue (hypocalcaemia). Deaths due to hypocalcaemia have been cited in the literature. Ingestion will cause severe pain and burns in the mouth and throat. Profound and possibly fatal hypocalcaemia is likely to occur unless medical treatment is promptly initiated. \u00a0Symptoms include spasm and twitching of the muscles, high fever, convulsion and general extreme pain. Inhalation may cause corrosion of the throat, nose and lungs, leading to severe inflammation, pulmonary oedema or possible hypocalcaemia. [NIOSHTIC]</p>",

Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Acrylic acid vapour has a pronounced respiratory irritation effect and gives some warning of exposure. If irritation occurs seek to reduce exposure with ventilation, other control measures or use P.P.E., otherwise evacuate area.</p> <p>The gastrointestinal tract is the major site of absorption of inhaled acrylic acid. Absorption involves dissolution in the mucous of the upper airways followed by mucociliary transport and finally ingestion. Excretion appears to take place through expiration or via the renal system.</p> <p>Exposure to irritant levels of acrylic acid decreased respiratory frequency, tidal volume and minute volume in unanaesthetised rats. In a fatal poisoning of a rat at 6000 ppm during a single 5 hour exposure autopsy revealed lung haemorrhage and degeneration of kidney tubules and liver. Rats exposed at 700 mg/m3 (238 ppm) for 4 hours/day for 5 weeks showed strong local irritation producing irreversible changes in eyes and skin, reduced body weight, increased reticulocyte counts and reduced urine concentrating capacity of the kidney. Inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and injury to gastric mucosa were also present</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material produces severe skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either:</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces severe inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant and severe inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> <li>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Acrylic acid is a definite skin sensitiser by the guinea pig maximisation test but not by the Draize method</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p>",
