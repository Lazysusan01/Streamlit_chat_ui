Polyunsaturated fatty acids are generally liquids at room temperature.<br />Vegetable oils (triglycerides) can be divided into three groups; non-drying, semi-drying, and drying oils, depending on their fatty acid pattern.<br />Drying-oils are highly unsaturated oils that oxidise in air to produce a tack-free film with time. A drying-oil is traditionally defined as an oil with an average number of greater than 2.2 diallylic (unsaturated) groups per molecule. Linseed and tung oil  (PUFAs) are commonly used drying-oils. <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Several epidemiological and experimental\r\nstudies in animals and humans have suggested that the consumption of foods rich\r\nin phytooestrogens may have protective effects on estrogen-related conditions,\r\nsuch as menopausal symptoms, and</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">estrogen-related diseases, such as prostate\r\nand breast cancers, osteoporosis, and CVD. Potential protective properties of\r\nphytoestrogens and phytoestrogen-containing foods against hormone-dependent\r\nbreast and prostate cancers and cardiovascular (CVD), and as estrogen\r\nreplacement therapy (ERT) are being considered.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Phytoestrogens are polyphenolic\r\nnon-steroidal plant compounds that are structurally similar to 17beta-estradiol\r\nand thus may act as estrogen agonists or antagonist. Selective estrogen\r\nreceptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that bind to estrogen receptors and\r\nmodulate agonist or antagonist responses depending on the target tissue</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Estrogens are key regulators in a wide\r\nvariety of target tissues, such as the male and female reproductive systems,\r\nbone tissue, and the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Estrogens are\r\nused for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal symptoms and as\r\ncontraceptives, while estrogen antagonists are used in the treatment of\r\nhormone-dependent breast cancers</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">A triglyceride (TG,\r\ntriacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol\r\nand three fatty acids (from tri- and glyceride)\u00a0 Triglycerides are the main\r\nconstituents of body fat in humans and other vertebrates, as well as vegetable\r\nfat.They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference\r\nof adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of\r\nhuman skin oil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Linseed oil and related oils are\r\nimportant components of useful products used in oil paints and related\r\ncoatings. Linseed oil is rich in di- and tri-unsaturated fatty acid components,\r\nwhich tend to harden in the presence of oxygen. This heat-producing hardening\r\nprocess is peculiar to these so-called drying oils. It is caused by a\r\npolymerization process that begins with oxygen molecules attacking the carbon\r\nbackbone. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides are also split into\r\ntheir components via transesterification during the manufacture of biodiesel.\r\nThe resulting fatty acid esters can be used as fuel in diesel engines. The\r\nglycerin has many uses, such as in the manufacture of food and in the\r\nproduction of pharmaceuticals</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are many different types of\r\ntriglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The pancreatic lipase acts at the\r\nester bond, hydrolyzing the bond and \"releasing\" the fatty acid. In\r\ntriglyceride form, lipids cannot be absorbed by the duodenum. Fatty acids,\r\nmonoglycerides (one glycerol, one fatty acid), and some diglycerides are\r\nabsorbed by the duodenum, once the triglycerides have been broken down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the intestine, following the\r\nsecretion of lipases and bile, triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol\r\nand free fatty acids in a process called lipolysis. They are subsequently moved\r\nto absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines. The triglycerides are\r\nrebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with\r\ncholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons. These are excreted from the\r\ncells and collected by the lymph system and transported to the large vessels\r\nnear the heart before being mixed into the blood. Various tissues can capture\r\nthe chylomicrons, releasing the triglycerides to be used as a source of energy.\r\nLiver cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires\r\nfatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of\r\nthe triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As\r\nthe brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source (unless converted to a\r\nketone) the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose,\r\nvia gluconeogenesis by conversion into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and then into\r\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, for brain fuel when it is broken down. Fat cells\r\nmay also be broken down for that reason if the brain's needs ever outweigh the\r\nbody's.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides cannot pass through\r\ncell membranes freely. Special enzymes on the walls of blood vessels called\r\nlipoprotein lipases must break down triglycerides into free fatty acids and\r\nglycerol. Fatty acids can then be taken up by cells via the fatty acid\r\ntransporter (FAT).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides, as major\r\ncomponents of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an\r\nimportant role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat.\r\nThey contain more than twice as much energy (approximately 9 kcal/g or 38 kJ/g)\r\nas carbohydrates (approximately 4 kcal/g or 17 kJ/g)</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant sterols have been shown to\r\nlower/reduce blood cholesterol.

Phytoestrogens are a large group of\r\ncompounds with different chemical structures and multiple mechanisms of\r\naction.\u00a0 Based on their chemical structure, phytoestrogens can be classified\r\ninto several main groups, i.e., isoflavonoids (such as genistein, daidzen,\r\ncoumestrol and equol), flavonoids (including several prenylated flavonoids,\r\nsuch as 8-prenylnaringenin -hopein- and triterpenes), stilbenes (such as\r\nresveratrol), anthraquinones, lignans (a group of dimeric phenylpropanoids\r\nderived typically from matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol) and several\r\nsaponins </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Oestrogens (typically 17beta-estradiol)\r\nprevent heart diseases, atherosclerosis, and vascular diseases, so it is\r\nexpected that phytoestrogens probably act similarly. However, there is no\r\ndirect evidence in this regard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Phytooestrogens\u00a0 nonsteroidal, naturally\r\noccurring phenolic compounds that can be divided into two groups: firstly, the\r\nflavonoids specifically isoflavones, coumestans, and prenyl flavonoids; and\r\nsecondly, the nonflavonoids, comprising the some lignans, saponins and\r\nanthraquinones. All are polyphenols that have a structural similarity to\r\nestradiol and possess estrogenic activity due to having a similar ring as that\r\nof estradiol and possessing two hydroxyl groups at positions that afford the\r\ncorrect distance between them to facilitate binding to the ER. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Phytoestrogens share the basic frame of\r\nother steroid hormones, although their potencies are estimated to be approximately\r\n1000-fold weaker than that of 17-alpha-estradiol. To date, more than 300 plants\r\nhave been found that possess compounds with estrogenic activity. Several\r\nclasses of phytoestrogens have been identified and studied: the hormone-like\r\nbis-phenolic phytoestrogens, the isoflavonoids daidzein and genistein,\r\ncoumestrol, and the lignans and matairesinols are of great interest because of\r\ntheir respective estrogenic, antiestrogenic, anticarcinogenic, and antioxidant\r\nactivities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Several phytoestrogens have been reported\r\nto exert various non-ER-related effects in vitro. These effects include\r\nantiproliferative activity, inhibition of tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C,\r\nDNA topoisomerase II, antioxidant activity, inhibition of angiogenesis, and\r\ninhibition of prostaglandin synthase. All of these actions require high\r\nconcentrations, generally over 10 mM, and it is still questionable whether such\r\nconcentrations are ever reached in vivo. In theory, these actions could play a\r\nrole in cancer prevention, but they need to be confirmed in vivo before any\r\nconclusions on their biological relevance can be made</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3210008/</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>http://enzysante.be/resources/Isoflavones.pdf</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Glycerides, more correctly known\r\nas acylglycerols, are esters formed from glycerol and fatty acids.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glycerol has three hydroxyl\r\nfunctional groups, which can be esterified with one, two, or three fatty acids\r\nto form monoglycerides (MAGs), diglycerides (DAGs), and triglycerides (TAGs).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Vegetable oils and animal fats\r\ncontain mostly triglycerides, but are broken down by natural enzymes (lipases)\r\ninto mono and diglycerides and free fatty acids and glycerol.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Partial glycerides are esters of\r\nglycerol with fatty acids, where not all the hydroxyl groups are esterified.\r\nSince some of their hydroxyl groups are free their molecules are polar. Partial\r\nglycerides may be monoglycerides (two hydroxyl groups free) or diglycerides\r\n(one hydroxyl group free). Short chain partial glycerides are more strongly\r\npolar than long chain partial glycerides, and have excellent solvent properties\r\nfor many hard-to-solubilise drugs, making them valuable as excipients in\r\nimproving the formulation of certain pharmaceuticals. The most common forms of\r\nacylglycerol are triglycerides, having high caloric value and usually yielding\r\ntwice as much energy per gram as carbohydrate</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Free phytosterols extracted from oils are\r\ninsoluble in water, relatively insoluble in oil, and soluble in alcohols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols\r\nand stanols, are phytosteroids similar to cholesterol which occur in plants and\r\nvary only in carbon side chains and/or presence or absence of a double bond.\r\nStanols are saturated sterols, having no double bonds in the sterol ring\r\nstructure. More than 200 sterols and related compounds have been identified.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Triglycerides are hydrophobic\r\nmaterials that range from oils, at the lowest molecular weights/shortest\r\nchain-lengths, to waxy solids, at the highest molecular weights/longest\r\nchain-lengths. Some triglycerides are produced synthetically via classical\r\nFischer type esterification methods (i.e., reaction of carboxylic acids with a\r\nglycerin to produce carboxylic esters), although the reaction may be promoted\r\nby acid or base catalysis, or by the use of an acid chloride.\u00a0 However, some of\r\nthese ingredients may be natural sourced and produced by transesterification\r\n(i.e., exchange of acid moieties to create a different ester product).\u00a0 For\r\nexample, the triglycerides in natural oils can be reacted with intended length\r\nfatty acids to produce new triglycerides.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trisubstituted glycerols (TAGs;\r\nglycerolipids) represent the most abundant lipid class in oils and fats of\r\nanimal origin, and comprise the bulk of storage fat in mammalian tissue. These\r\nmolecules exist as enantiomers, since a center of asymmetry is created upon enzymatic\r\nbiosynthesis at carbon 2 of the glycerol backbone. During the biosynthesis and\r\ndigestion of TAGs, diacylglycerols (diglycerides, DAGs) and monoacylglycerols\r\n(monoglycerides, MAGs) are formed as intermediates, with two and one fatty acid\r\nsubstitution at the glycerol backbone, respectively</span></p>",

The\r\npredicted or measured water solubilities of these olefins range from 50 mg/L at\r\n20 C for hexene to 0.00015 mg/L at 25 C for 1-octadecene, and to 6.33 [E-23]\r\nmg/L at 25 C for C54 alpha olefin, which suggests there is a lower potential\r\nfor the larger olefins to be bioavailable to aquatic organisms due to their low\r\nsolubilities. Their vapor pressures range from 230.6 hPa at 25 C for hexene to\r\n0.00009 hPa at 25 C for 1-octadecene, and to 1.13 [E-16] hPa at 25 C for C54\r\nalpha olefin, which suggests the shorter chain olefins will tend to partition\r\nto the air at a significant rate and not remain in the other environmental\r\ncompartments for long periods of time; while the longer chain olefins will tend\r\nto partition primarily to water, soil or sediment, depending on water\r\nsolubility and sorption behavior. The predicted soil adsorption coefficients\r\n(Koc) range from 149 for C6 to 230,800 for C18 and to 1.0 [E10] for C54,\r\nindicating increasing partitioning to soil/sediment with increasing carbon\r\nnumber. Level I fugacity modelling predicts that the C6-13 olefins would\r\npartition primarily to air, while the C16 and longer chain olefins would\r\npartition primarily to soil. Results of Level III fugacity modelling suggest\r\nthat the C6 -8 olefins will partition primarily to the water compartment; and,\r\nas the chain length increases beyond C10, soil and sediment become the primary\r\ncompartments. These chemicals have a very low potential to hydrolyse and do not\r\nphotodegrade directly. However, in the air, all members of the category are\r\nsubject to atmospheric oxidation from hydroxyl radical attack, with calculated\r\ndegradation half- lives of 1.8 to 4.8 hours. C6 -30 olefins have been shown to\r\ndegrade to an extent of approximately 8-92% in standard 28 day biodegradation\r\ntests. These results were not clearly correlated with carbon number or any\r\nother identifiable parameter; however, the weight of evidence shows that the\r\nmembers of the higher olefins have potential for degradation in the\r\nenvironment. Volatilisation from water is predicted to occur rapidly (hours to\r\ndays), with Henry\u2019s Law Constants (bond method) ranging from 0.423 (C6) to 10.7\r\n(C18), and to 2.89 [E5] (C54) atm- m3/mol. Consideration of these degradation\r\nprocesses supports the assessment that these substances will degrade relatively\r\nrapidly in the environment and not persist. Based on calculated\r\nbioconcentration factors, the C6, C7, and C16 and longer chain length category\r\nmembers are not expected to bioaccumulate (BCF: C6 = 44-46, C7 = 236, C16 =\r\n71-92 and &gt;= C18 = 3.2-4.6). Although the C8 - 15 olefins have BCFs ranging\r\nfrom 313 to 2030, and Kow values ranging from 4.13 to 7.49, and thus are\r\nconsidered to have the potential for bioaccumulation, their physico-chemical\r\nproperties and fate indicate that there would be limited environmental exposure\r\nbecause of volatility, biodegradability and limited solubility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Data indicate that acute aquatic toxicity can be observed for C6\r\nthrough the C10 olefins (C6: EC/LC50 range of 1-10 mg/L; C7-C10: EC/LC50 range\r\nof 0.1-1.0 mg/L), and that toxicity increases with increasing carbon number\r\nwithin that range, which is consistent with increasing Kow values (3.07 -5.12).\r\nAbove a chain length of 10, toxicity is not observed within the limits of\r\nsolubility.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>vegetable oil mists (except\r\ncastor, cashew nut and similar irritant oils)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>TLV TWA: 10 mg/m3</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>ES TWA: 10 mg/m3</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>OSHA PEL TWA: 15 mg/m3, total\r\nparticulate; 5 mg/m3, respirable particulate</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>The common vegetable oil mists\r\nare considered &quot;nuisance&quot; particulates which have little adverse\r\neffect on the lung.

It has been found that the serum LDL-C-lowering effect of\r\nphytosterol/stanol originates from reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption.\r\nIt was hypothesised that phytosterols were incorporated into the mixed micelles\r\nin the intestinal tract more readily than cholesterol, therefore displacing\r\ncholesterol from mixed micelles and resulting in reduced intestinal cholesterol\r\nabsorption. Other findings suggest that there is an additional process in which\r\nphytosterol/stanols actively influence cellular cholesterol metabolism within\r\nintestinal enterocytes. Additionally, in response to the reduced supply of\r\nexogenous cholesterol, receptor mediated lipoprotein cholesterol uptake is\r\nprobably enhanced.The discovery of transporters in the intestinal mucosa cells\r\nand hepatocytes has given new insights into the regulation of the intestinal\r\nabsorption of sterols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The physiologically active forms are most\r\nlikely the free, unesterified phytosterol/stanols.

Interest in the dietary phytooestrogens derives from their apparent protective effects against cancer, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. High levels, over extended periods, may produce toxic effects.</p>\n<p>However, toxicological studies revealed that when administered in isolated or enriched form or at high doses isoflavones impair the function of the thyroid gland. It cannot be ruled out that this oestrogen-like effect also encourages the onset of breast cancer. Since women are more at risk of developing cancer in any case after menopause, the intake of food supplements with a high isoflavone content may present unexpected risks for this group of consumers.</p>\n<p>Although phytooestrogens exist as the inactive glycoside in food products, bacterial beta-glycosidases, in the colon, hydrolyse the glycosides to the active aglycones.</p>\n<p>A common feature of the phytooestrogens is their striking similarity to 17beta-oestrodiol and the synthetic oestrogen, diethylstilboestrol. There is evidence that phytooestrogens may mediate oestrogen-like effects by direct interaction with the oestrogen receptor of cells.\u00a0 Although the hormonal activity of phytooestrogens is two to five orders of magnitude below that of oestradiol, their high concentration in certain plants and their slower metabolic disposition, can lead to tissue levels exceeding those of endogenous oestrogens by a factor of a thousand or more.</p>\n<p>There is also evidence that phytooestrogens may influence animal and human health by acting as antioxidants and hydrogen peroxide scavengers or by interfering with eicosanoid and cytokine production and cell signalling.</p>\n<p>Anogenital distance, puberty onset, oestrus cycling, growth, sex-organ weight and hormonal profile are indicators of oestrogen- or anti-oestrogen like activity. Of interest is the finding that low doses of the dietary isoflavone, genistein, taken by pregnant rats produced shorter anogenital distances in the offspring; high doses did not produce this effect.\u00a0 Exposure to a 5% flaxseed diet (high in lignans) during pregnancy and lactation, resulted in the delayed puberty onset in rats (anti-oestrogenic effect). By contrast, a 10% flaxseed diet produced an earlier onset of puberty (an oestrogenic effect), but longer oestrus cycles due to prolonged dioestrus (an antioestrogenic effect).</p>\n<p>There have been many reports of phytooestrogens disrupting reproductive activity in sheep. Infertility in sheep (so-called \"clover disease\") has been traced to isoflavone concentrations in clover (up to 5% dry weight).\u00a0 Temporary infertility is attributed to increased embryo mortality and a reduction or cessation in ovulation. Permanent infertility, in sheep, is purported to occur after 3 years of exposure to dietary oestrogenic compounds; this infertility is due to permanent changes in the architecture of the cervix and also changes in the viscoelasticity of the cervical mucous which prevents the transport of sperm through the cervix. In addition to these effects, phytooestrogens exert effects on oestrogen-sensitive tissues such as the mammary gland and female reproductive organs of the ewe. Cattle have also been shown to be sensitive to the oestrogen-like effects of dietary phytooestrogens. Specific observations include swelling of the vulva, discharge of cervical mucous, uterus enlargements and cystic ovaries. Irregular oestrus cycles, including periods of anoestrus, and decreased rates of conception have also been reported. The impact on reproductive activity, by phytooestrogens on humans, is unknown.</p>\n<p>The recent practice of feeding infants soy-based formula raises issues related to the long-term health effects of exposure during development. It has been recognised, for example,\u00a0 that the practice may be associated with goiter (thyroid enlargement associated with thyroid hormone deficiency) in humans and animals. Soy phytooestrogens inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis at concentrations which occur in infant formula.</p>\n<p>If sufficient inhibition of iodide uptake by the goiter occurs, formation of thyroid hormones is depressed. These hormones are essential to the regulation of oxygen consumption and metabolism throughout the body. Clinical manifestations of this so-called<strong> \"hypothyroidism (or athyrea)\"</strong> include low metabolic rate, a tendency to gain weight, somnolence, and myxoedema (a relatively hard oedema of the subcutaneous tissue), dryness and loss of hair, low body temperature, hoarseness, muscle weakness, a slow return of the muscle after tendon jerk, and slow mentation. When hypothyroidism occurs in women, early in pregnancy, the foetus is at risk of impaired physical and mental development, the severity of the impairment depending on the degree of hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p>The relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was investigated. Phytoestrogens modulate sex hormone and SHBG levels in postmenopausal women and interact with gene variants involved in oestrogen signaling. Such phytooestrogen-gene interactions may explain the conflicting literature on the hormonal effects of phytooestrogens.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Glyceryl triesters\r\n(triglycerides), following ingestion, are metabolised to monoglycerides, free\r\nfatty acids and glycerol, all of which are absorbed in the intestinal mucosa\r\nand undergo further metabolism.

However, the relative negative impact of raised levels of\r\ntriglycerides compared to that of LDL:HDL ratios is as yet unknown. The risk\r\ncan be partly accounted for by a strong inverse relationship between\r\ntriglyceride level and HDL-cholesterol level. But the risk is also due to high\r\ntriglyceride levels increasing the quantity of small, dense LDL particles</span></p> <p>Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) may produce reproductive effects in females. Effects of exposure with therapeutic use in post-menopausal women, not taking oestrogen replacement therapy, may include blood clots in veins, leg cramps and hot flushes.</p> <p>This class of drugs is also known to increase the risk of uterine cancers\u00a0</p> <p>A characteristic that distinguishes these substances from pure receptor agonists and antagonists is that their action is different in various tissues, thereby granting the possibility to selectively inhibit or stimulate oestrogen-like action in various tissues.</p> <p>Oestrogenic compounds span a spectrum of activity ranging from:</p> <ul> <li>full agonists (agonistic in all tissues) such as the natural endogenous hormone oestrogen\u00a0</li> <li>mixed agonists/antagonistics (agonistic in some tissues while antagonist in others) such as tamoxifen (a SERM)\u00a0</li> <li>pure antagonists (antagonistic in all tissues) such as fulvestrant (ICI-182780).\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>The mechanism of mixed agonism/antagonism may differ depending on the chemical structure of the SERM, but for at least for some SERMs, it appears to be related to (1) the ratio of co-activator to co-repressor proteins in different cell types and (2) the conformation of the oestrogen receptor induced by drug binding which in turn determines how strongly the drug/receptor complex recruits co-activators (resulting in an agonist response) relative to co-repressors (resulting in antagonism). For example, the prototypical SERM tamoxifen acts as an antagonist in breast and conversely an agonist in uterus. The concentration of steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1;\u00a0<i>NCOA1</i>) is higher in uterus than in breast, therefore SERMs such as tamoxifen are more agonistic in uterus than in breast. In contrast, raloxifene behaves as an antagonist in both tissues. It appears that raloxifene more strongly recruits co-repressor proteins and consequently is still an antagonist in the uterus despite the higher concentration of co-activators relative to co-repressors</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Synthetic 1,2-diglycerides of short chain (C6, C8, C10) fatty\r\nacids are activators of protein kinase C (PKC). PKC is a serine-threonine\r\nkinase which also requires calcium ion for its activation. Activated PKC\r\nphosphorylates proteins of the cellular signal cascade, which eventually induce\r\nexpression of growth regulatory genes. This, in turn, may promote the growth of\r\ntumours. Structural analogues of the 1,2-diglycerides, such as the phorbol\r\nesters, have been shown to strongly promote such an event.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In biochemical signaling, diacylglycerol (DAG) functions as a\r\nsecond messenger signaling lipid, and is a product of the hydrolysis of the\r\nphospholipid PIP2 (phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate) by the enzyme\r\nphospholipase C (PLC) (a membrane-bound enzyme) that, through the same\r\nreaction, produces inositol trisphosphate (IP3). Although inositol\r\ntrisphosphate (IP3) diffuses into the cytosol, DAG remains within the plasma\r\nmembrane due to its hydrophobic properties. IP3 stimulates the release of\r\ncalcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DAG is a physiological\r\nactivator of protein kinase C (PKC). The production of DAG in the membrane\r\nfacilitates translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glyceryl dilaurate, glyceryl diarachidate, glyceryl dibehenate,\r\nglyceryl dierucate, glyceryl dihydroxystearate, glyceryl diisopalmitate,\r\nglyceryl diisostearate, glyceryl dilinoleate, glyceryl dimyristate, glyceryl\r\ndioleate, glyceryl diricinoleate, glyceryl dipalmitate, glyceryl\r\ndipalmitoleate, glyceryl distearate, glyceryl palmitate lactate, glyceryl\r\nstearate citrate, glyceryl stearate lactate, and glyceryl stearate succinate\r\nare diacylglycerols (also known as DAGs,\u00a0 diglycerides or glyceryl diesters)\r\nthat function as skin conditioning agents-emollients in cosmetics. Only\r\nglyceryl dilaurate (up to 5%), glyceryl diisostearate (up to 43%), glyceryl\r\ndioleate (up to 2%), glyceryl distearate (up to 7%), and glyceryl stearate\r\nlactate (up to 5%) are reported to be in current use. Production proceeds from\r\nfully refined vegetable oils, which are further processed using hydrogenation\r\nand fractionation techniques, and the end products are produced by reacting\r\nselected mixtures of the partly hydrogenated, partly fractionated oils and fats\r\nwith vegetable-derived glycerine to yield partial glycerides. In the final\r\nstage of the production process, the products are purified by deodorization,\r\nwhich effectively removes pesticide residues and lower boiling residues such as\r\nresidues of halogenated solvents and aromatic solvents. Diglycerides have been\r\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as indirect food\r\nadditives. Nominally, these ingredients are 1,3-diglycerides, but are easily\r\nisomerised to the 1,2-diglycerides form. The 1,3-diglyceride isomer is not a\r\nsignificant toxicant in acute, short-term, subchronic, or chronic animal tests.\r\nGlyceryl dilaurate was a mild primary irritant in albino rabbits, but not a\r\nskin sensitiser in guinea pig maximization tests. Diacylglycerol oil was not\r\ngenotoxic in the Ames test, in mammalian Chinese hamster lung cells, or in a\r\nrodent bone marrow micronucleus assay. An eye shadow containing 1.5% glyceryl\r\ndilaurate did not induce skin irritation in a single insult patch test, but\r\nmild skin irritation reactions to a foundation containing the same\r\nconcentration were observed. A trade mixture containing an unspecified\r\nconcentration of glyceryl dibehenate did not induce irritation or significant\r\ncutaneous intolerance in a 48-h occlusive patch test. In maximization tests,\r\nneither an eye shadow nor a foundation containing 1.5% glyceryl dilaurate was a\r\nskin sensitiser. Sensitisation was not induced in subjects patch tested with\r\n50% <i>w/w</i> glyceryl dioleate in a repeated insult, occlusive patch test.\r\nGlyceryl palmitate lactate (50% <i>w/v</i>) did not induce skin irritation or\r\nsensitization in subjects patch tested in a repeat-insult patch test.\r\nPhototoxicity or photoallergenicity was not induced in healthy volunteers\r\ntested with a lipstick containing 1.0% Glyceryl rosinate. Two diacylglycerols,\r\n1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycerol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, did not alter\r\ncell proliferation (as determined by DNA synthesis) in normal human dermal\r\nfibroblasts in vitro at doses up to 10 <i>\u00b5</i>g/ml. In the absence of\r\ninitiation, Glyceryl distearate induced a moderate hyperplastic response in\r\nrandomly bred mice of a tumor-resistant strain, and with\r\n9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA) initiation, an increase in the total\r\ncell count was observed. In a glyceryl monoester study, a single application of\r\nDMBA to the skin followed by 5% glyceryl stearate twice weekly produced no\r\ntumors, but slight epidermal hyperplasia at the site of application. Glyceryl\r\ndioleate induced transformation in 3-methylcholanthrene-initiated BALB/3T3\r\nA31-1-1 cloned cells in vitro. A tumour-promoting dosing regimen that consisted\r\nof multiple applications of 10 <i>\u00b5</i>mol of a 1,2-diacylglycerol\r\n(sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol) to female mice twice daily for 1 week caused more\r\nthan a 60% decrease in protein kinase C (PKC) activity and marked epidermal\r\nhyperplasia. Applications of 10 umol sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol twice weekly for\r\n1 week caused a decrease in cytosolic PKC activity, an increase in particulate\r\nPKC activity, and no epidermal hyperplasia. In studies of the tumour-promoting\r\nactivity of 1,2-diacylglycerols, dose and the exposure regimen by which the\r\ndose is delivered play a role in tumor promotion. The\r\n1,2-diacylglycerol\u2013induced activation of PKC may also relate to the saturation\r\nof the fatty acid in the 1 or 2 position; 1,2-Diacylglycerols with two\r\nsaturated fatty acids are less effective. Also, the activity of\r\n1,2-diacylglycerols may be reduced when the fatty acid moiety in the structure\r\nis a long-chain fatty acid. A histological evaluation was performed on human\r\nskin from female volunteers (18 to 56 years old) who had applied a prototype\r\nlotion or placebo formulation, both containing 0.5% Glyceryl Dilaurate,\r\nconsecutively for 16 weeks or 21 weeks. Skin irritation was not observed in any\r\nof the subjects tested. Biopsies (2 mm) taken from both legs of five subjects\r\nindicated no recognizable abnormalities of the skin; the epidermis was normal\r\nin thickness, and there was no evidence of scaling, inflammation, or neoplasms\r\nin any of the tissues that were evaluated. The available safety test data\r\nindicate that diglycerides in the 1,3-diester form do not present any\r\nsignificant acute toxicity risk, nor are these ingredients irritating,\r\nsensitizing, or photosensitising. Whereas no data are available regarding\r\nreproductive or developmental toxicity, there is no reason to suspect any such\r\ntoxicity because the dermal absorption of these chemicals is negligible.\r\n1,3-Diglycerides contain 1,2-diglycerides, raising the concern that\r\n1,2-diglycerides could potentially induce hyperplasia. Data regarding the\r\ninduction of PKC and the tumour promotion potential of 1,2-diacylglycerols\r\nincreases the level of concern. Most of the diglycerides considered above, however,\r\nhave fatty acid chains longer than 14 carbons and none have mixed\r\nsaturated/unsaturated fatty acid moieties. In a 21-week use study of a\r\nprototype lotion containing 0.5% glyceryl dilaurate (a 14-carbon chain fatty\r\nacid) indicated no evidence of scaling, inflammation, or neoplasms in biopsy\r\nspecimens. Also, DNA synthesis assays on glyceryl dilaurate and glyceryl\r\ndistearate indicated that neither chemical altered cell proliferation (as\r\ndetermined by DNA synthesis) in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro at\r\ndoses up to 10 ug/ml. However the concentration of these ingredients can vary\r\n(up to 43% for glyceryl diisostearate in lipstick), the frequency of\r\napplication can be several times daily, and the proportion of diglycerides that\r\nare inactive 1,3 isomers versus potentially biologically active 1,2 isomers is\r\nunknown; as a precaution it\u00a0 is believed that each use should be examined to\r\nensure the absence of epidermal hyperplasia during product development and\r\ntesting. In the absence of inhalation toxicity data on the glyceryl diesters it\r\nis thought that these ingredients can be used safely in aerosolised products\r\nbecause they are not respirable. Although there are gaps in knowledge about\r\nproduct use, the overall information available on the types of products in\r\nwhich these ingredients are used and at what concentration indicate a pattern\r\nof use. Within this overall pattern of use, the CIR Expert Panel considers all\r\ningredients in this group to be safe.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">International Journal of Toxicology, Vol. 26, No. 3 Suppl, 1-30\r\n(2007)</span></p>",

Base material for high temperature mortars.|<p>Synthetic amorphous (non-crystalline) silica (SAS) can be divided into two groups according to whether the manufacturing process is by the wet route (precipitated silica, silica gel) or the thermal route (pyrogenic silica). Colloidal silicas (silica sols) are stable dispersions of SASs in a liquid, usually water. Furthermore, SASs, which are generally hydrophilic, may be rendered hydrophobic by surface treatment. SASs exist as highly pure, white, fluffy powders or milky-white dispersions of these powders in fluids (usually water).</p> <p>A significant proportion of the global production of SAS is rendered hydrophobic by surface modification mainly with Si-organic compounds. Surface modified (after-treated) SAS can be obtained either by physical or chemical reaction. The most common Si-organic compounds used for the treatment are hexamethyldisilazane (CAS No. 999-97-3), dimethyldichlorsilane (CAS No. 75-78-5) and polydimethylsiloxanes (e.g. CAS No. 9016-00-6). The first compound forms mono-functional moieties upon hydrolysis [(Si-O-Si(CH3)3], whereas the latter two give rise to bi-functional units [Si-O-[Si(CH3)2-O]x].\u00a0The surface treatment does not change the solid properties e.g. particle size, dissolution kinetics of the inorganic polymer silicon dioxide (silica, SiO2). However, surface treatment does alter physico-chemical properties, e.g. reduced moisture uptake.</p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p> <p>Repeated exposure to synthetic amorphous silicas may produce skin dryness and cracking.</p> <p>\u00a0Available data confirm the absence of significant toxicity by oral and dermal routes of exposure.</p> <p>Numerous repeated-dose, subchronic and chronic inhalation toxicity studies have been conducted in a number of species, at airborne concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3. Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",
