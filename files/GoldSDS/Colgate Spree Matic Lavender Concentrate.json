As a water softener; in photography; in textile bleaches; in pulp and paper manufacture; aluminium production; petroleum refining; sealing ponds from leakage; coal liquefaction catalyst; food additive.|A naturally occurring form of sodium carbonate decahydrate with 17% sodium bicarbonate, called Natron (CAS RN: 7542-12-3), is commercially available and. has been used for thousands of years as a cleaning product for both the home and body. Blended with oil, it was an early form of soap. It softens water while removing oil and grease. Undiluted, natron was a cleanser for the teeth and an early mouthwash. The mineral was mixed into early antiseptics for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, was used for making leather and as a bleach for clothing.|The mineral was used in Egyptian mummification because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, when exposed to moisture the carbonate in natron increases pH (raises alkalinity), which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both the living and the dead. Natron was added to castor oil to make a smokeless fuel, which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.|Natron is an ingredient for making a distinct color called Egyptian blue. It was used along with sand and lime in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until 640 AD. The mineral was also employed as a flux to solder precious metals together.",

For this reason the effect of sodium carbonate on the organisms depends on the buffer capacity of the aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem.\u00a0</p> <p>Individual aquatic ecosystems are characterized by a specific pH and bicarbonate concentration and the organisms of the ecosystem are adapted to these specific natural conditions. Because the natural pH, bicarbonate and also the sodium concentration (and their fluctuations in time) varies significantly between aquatic ecosystems, it is not considered useful to derive a generic PNEC or PNECadded. To assess the potential environmental effect of a sodium carbonate discharge, the increase in sodium, bicarbonate and pH should be compared with the natural values and their fluctuations and based on this comparison it should be assessed if the anthropogenic addition is acceptable.</p> <p>The production and use of sodium carbonate could potentially result in an emission of sodium carbonate and it could locally increase the pH in the aquatic environment. However, the pH of effluents is normally measured very frequently and can be adapted easily and therefore a significant increase of the pH of the receiving water is not expected. If emissions of waste water are controlled by appropriate pH limits and/or dilutions in relation to the natural pH and buffering capacity of the receiving water, adverse effects on the aquatic environment are not expected due to production or use of sodium carbonate.</p> <p>The sodium ion will not adsorb to particulate matter, but remains in the aqueous phase. In water the carbonate ions will re-equilibrate until an equilibrium is established.</p> <p>The main equilibria are:</p> <p>HCO3- &lt;-&gt; CO3 (2+)-\u00a0+ H+ \u00a0 \u00a0 pKa = 10.35</p> <p>CO2\u00a0+ H2O &lt;-&gt; HCO3--\u00a0+ H+ \u00a0 \u00a0pKa = 6.33</p> <p>The carbonate will finally be incorporated into the inorganic and organic carbon cycle.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate EC50 (48 h): Cladoceran ceriodaphnia cf Dubia: 200-227 mg/l (immobilisation)</p> <p>The variation in acute toxicity for aquatic organisms may be explained for a significant extent by the variation in buffer capacity of the test medium. In general, mortality of the test organisms was found at concentrations higher than 100 mg/l but for Amphipoda, salmon and trout lethal effects were already observed at 67- 80 mg/l although these studies had a low reliability.</p> <p>Aquatic sodium emissions originating from uses of sodium carbonate are probably small compared to other sources.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Potassium and\r\nsodium cations are essential micronutrients that are ubiquitous in the\r\nenvironment. As such, their uptake is tightly regulated and is therefore not\r\nconsidered to pose a risk for ecotoxicity. The pyrophosphate anion is unstable\r\nin aqueous solutions with the degree of instability varying according to pH. In\r\ndistilled water pyrophosphates will hydrolyse slowly via abiotic mechanisms to\r\ninorganic phosphate. In natural waters a number of different processes can\r\noccur; abiotic hydrolysis, biotic degradation (as a result of the action of\r\nphosphatases which cleave pyrophosphate into orthophosphate subunits) and\r\nassimilation by organisms in the water all resulting in an ultimate breakdown\r\nproduct of orthophosphate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50\u00a0 (96 h):\u00a0 rainbow trout\r\n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) &gt; 100 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia magna EC50 (48 h):\r\n&gt;100 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Algae EC50 &gt;100 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activated sludge EC50 &gt;100\r\nmg/l</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The principal problems of phosphate contamination of the environment relates to eutrophication processes in lakes and ponds. Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment. The growth of algae produces undesirable effects on the treatment of water for drinking purposes, on fisheries, and on the use of lakes for recreational purposes.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "AcuteEye": "<p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Direct contact of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, with the eye, causes severe irritation and corneal injury in rabbits.</p> <p>Alkaline salts may be intensely irritating to the eyes and precautions should be taken to ensure direct eye contact is avoided.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Inorganic polyphosphates are used extensively in domestic and industrial products. Rats fed 10% sodium trimetaphosphate for a month exhibited transient tubular necrosis;</p> <p>those given 10% sodium metaphosphate exhibited growth retardation; 10% sodium hexametaphosphate produced pale and swollen kidneys.</p> <p>Salts of this type appear to be hydrolysed in the bowel to produce phosphoric acid and systemic acidosis may result following absorption. Higher molecular weight species, absorbed from the alimentary canal, may produce hypocalcaemic tetany due to binding of ionised calcium by the absorbed phosphate. This is reported in at least one case following ingestion of sodium tripolyphosphate.</p> <p>Ingestion of large amounts of tetrasodium pyrophosphate may cause diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, cramps and abdominal pain. The pyrophosphate is hydrolysed to the orthophosphate in the gut and because of this is may produce acidosis and hypocalcaemia</p> <p>Use as a food additive indicates good tolerance of small amounts, but excessive amounts or overuse may bring irritant and/or harmful effects</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Phosphates are slowly and incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are unlikely (other than in abuse) to produce the systemic effects which occur when introduced by other routes. Such effects include vomiting, lethargy, fever, diarrhoea, falls in blood pressure, slow pulse, cyanosis, carpal spasm, coma and tetany. These effects result following sequestration of blood calcium.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Ingestion of large amounts of phosphate salts (over 1 gm for an adult) may produce osmotic catharsis resulting in diarrhoea and probably, abdominal cramp. Large doses (4-8 gm) will almost certainly produce these effects in most individuals. Most of the ingested salt will be excreted in the faeces of healthy individuals without producing systemic toxicity. Doses in excess of 10 gm may produce systemic toxicity.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>In chronic animal studies inorganic polyphosphates produced growth inhibition, increased kidney weights (with calcium deposition and desquamation), bone decalcification, parathyroid hypertrophy and hyperplasia, inorganic phosphaturia, hepatic focal necrosis and alterations to the size of muscle fibres.</p> <p>Inorganic phosphates are not genotoxic in bacterial systems nor are they carcinogenic in rats. No reproductive or developmental toxicity was seen in studies using rats exposed to sodium hexametaphosphate or sodium trimetaphosphate.</p> <p>Dogs given daily doses of sodium phosphate dibasic for 9-22 weeks showed calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) with disseminated atrophy of the proximal tubule. Animals fed on sodium phosphate dibasic and potassium dihydrogen phosphate, in both short- and long-term studies, showed increased bone porosity; hyperparathyroidism and soft tissue calcification were also evident.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p>",
