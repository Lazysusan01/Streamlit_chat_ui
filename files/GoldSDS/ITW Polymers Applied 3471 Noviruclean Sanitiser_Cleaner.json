Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Several investigations have shown that the presence of NTA in water/sediment systems increases the concentration of heavy metals in the water phase .The diffusion from stable sediments is slow and several days are normally required before a steady state is achieved . An experiment with stable artificial sediment (kaolinite) indicated that high concentrations of NTA remobilised Zn and it was concluded that NTA concentrations above 200 ug/l might mobilise heavy metals from stable sediments\u00a0.</p> <p><b>Aerobic biodegradability:\u00a0</b>NTA is known to be aerobically biodegradable by acclimated microorganisms. Biodegradability tests with NTA have been inconsistent; 90% degradation has been reported after 9 and 13 days in tests with activated sludge, while degradation attained only 20% in a CO2 evolution test after 28 days and did not occur in shake flask and BOD tests \u00a0Following a period of acclimatisation, almost complete biodegradation has been reported for the activated sludge process when operated under optimum conditions. The efficiency of NTA removal during biological sewage treatment and the period of acclimatisation prior to NTA biodegradation has shown to be affected by factors like, e.g., the concentration of heavy metals, treatment temperature, NTA concentration and water hardness .</p> <p><b>Anaerobic biodegradability:\u00a0</b>The removal of NTA during anaerobic sludge digestion has been found to be variable and affected by operational characteristics. for example, \u00a0studies indicating no removal and up to 29-45% removal in digesters receiving co-settled primary and activated sludge over a period of 120 days have been reported\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The toxicity of NTA towards algae, crustaceans and fish is low with EC/LC50 values well above 100 mg/l\u00a0</p> <p>Microcystis aeruginosa EC50 (96 h): 180-320 mg/l</p> <p>Chlorella vulgaris EC50 (96 h): 560-1000 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna EC50 (48 h): 560-1000 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna NOEC (21 d): 100 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): guppy (Poecilia reticulate) 560-1000 mg/l; rice fish (Oryzias latipes) 560-1000 mg/l</p> <p>Fish NOEC: fathead minnow 53.9 mg/l</p> <p>Chelating agents might reduce the elimination of heavy metals by adsorption on activated sludge. A remobilisation of heavy metals out of river sediment might be expected.\u00a0</p> <p>Polyanionic monomers, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), are toxic to green algae. Toxicity to algae is moderate and it appears that the mode of toxic action of these polyanionic monomers is overchelation of nutrient elements needed by algae for growth.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Chelating effects of NTA carry body zinc into the kidney ultrafiltrate where it is reabsorbed by the cells of the tubular epithelium. Zinc is toxic to these cells producing cell injury and death leading to hyperplastic and eventually neoplastic responses.
