When released into water the material readily evaporates and is biodegradable.</p> <p>Ethanol does not bioaccumulate to an appreciable extent.</p> <p>The material is readily degraded by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxy radicals; release into air will result in photodegradation and wet deposition.</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p>TERRESTRIAL FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of ethanol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. The potential for volatilisation of ethanol from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mmHg. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for ethanol based on half-lives on the order of a few days for ethanol in sandy soil/groundwater microcosms.</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that ethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5X10-6 atm-m3/mole. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method, volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 39 days, respectively.An estimated BCF= 3, from a log Kow of -0.31 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in sunlit surface waters is not expected to be an important environmental fate process for ethanol since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyse or absorb light under environmentally relevant conditions. Ethanol was degraded with half-lives on the order of a few days in aquatic studies conducted using microcosms constructed with a low organic sandy soil and groundwater, indicating it is unlikely to be persistent in aquatic environments(8).\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: Ethanol, which has an extrapolated vapor pressure of 59.3 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase ethanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days, calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-12 m3/molecule-sec at 25 deg C.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>log Kow: -0.31- -0.32</p> <p>Half-life (hr) air: 144</p> <p>Half-life (hr) H2O surface water: 144</p> <p>Henry's atm m3 /mol: 6.29E-06</p> <p>BOD 5 if unstated: 0.93-1.67,63%</p> <p>COD: 1.99-2.11,97%</p> <p>ThOD: 2.1</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For ethanol:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 49-716 ppm (detection), 101 ppm (recognition)</p> <p>Eye and respiratory tract irritation do not appear to occur at exposure levels of less than 5000 ppm and the TLV-TWA is thought to provide an adequate margin of safety against such effects. Experiments in man show that inhalation of 1000 ppm caused slight symptoms of poisoning and 5000 ppm caused strong stupor and morbid sleepiness. Subjects exposed to 5000 ppm to 10000 ppm experienced smarting of the eyes and nose and coughing. Symptoms disappeared within minutes. Inhalation also causes local irritating effects to the eyes and upper respiratory tract, headaches, sensation of heat intraocular tension, stupor, fatigue and a need to sleep. At 15000 ppm there was continuous lachrymation and coughing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The most common signs of inhalation overexposure to ethanol, in animals, include ataxia, incoordination and drowsiness for those surviving narcosis. The narcotic dose for rats, after 2 hours of exposure, is 19260 ppm.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

Pre-adapted microorganisms can degrade glycerol rapidly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.<br /> Bioaccumulation: Based on Log Kow -1.76, glycerol will have a low bioaccumulation potential and is not expected to bioaccumulate.<br /> Photodegradation: The calculated half-life for the photo-oxidation (reaction with hydroxyl radicals) of glycerol in air is 6.8 hours (EPIWIN vs 3.04).<br /> Stability in Water:\u00a0 Glycerol does not contain functional groups that are expected to react with water.<br /> Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0 From the EQC model (Mackay level III), it can be deduced that 100% of glycerol will end up in the water phase. Negligible amounts will be distributed towards soil, air and sediment<br /> Ecotoxicity:<br /> Fish LC50: &gt;5000 mg/l<br /> Algae IC50: &gt;2900 mg/l<br /> Bacteria EC50: .10000 mg/l (Pseudomonas putida)<br /> The weight of evidence indicates that glycerol is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms and this conclusion is supported by QSAR predictions. The lowest LC50 for fish is a 24-h LC50 of &gt;5000 mg/l for Carassius auratus (Goldfish) and for aquatic invertebrates, a 24 h EC50 of &gt;10000 mg/l for Daphnia magna is the lowest EC50. Several tests on algae are available, which suggest very low toxicity to a range of species, however their validity is uncertain. A QSAR prediction for the 96h EC50 to algae was 78000 mg/l. No toxicity towards the microorganism Pseudomonas putida was observed at 10000 mg/l after exposure for 16 hours. No long-term aquatic toxicity data is available. Screening studies are available on frog and carp embryos which indicate some effects on growth and hatching rates respectively at very high concentrations of glycerol, &gt;7000 mg/l.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly.

Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special circumstances. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouses and enclosed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p>",

These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>",

A study of 866 persons using a formulation containing propylene glycol in a patch test indicated that propylene glycol caused primary irritation in 16% of exposed individuals probably caused by dehydration. Undiluted propylene glycol was tested on 1556 persons in a 24 hour patch test. 12.5% showed reactions which were largely toxic (70%) or allergic in nature (30%). Reaction responses reached their maximum on the second day or later. Reactions were seasonal in nature ranging from 17.8% in winter to 9.2% in other seasons. In a patch-test using 25 standard allergens conducted on 500 individuals, propylene glycol ranked fourth in sensitising response. 84 subjects were patch tested using 100% propylene glycol. as well as 2% and 5% in water.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen chloride</p> <p>phosgene</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

CPC is not hydrolysed. For the photochemical degradation in water layers near the surface, a half-life of 28.5 days is calculated.</p> <p>Through cation exchange in sewage sludge and soil and sediment constituents, relevant enrichment in sewage sludge and geoaccumulation of CPC is likely.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For sewage sludge, a non-microbiocidal effect of 1.0 mg/l and an IC50 of 20 mg/l were determined. The minimal inhibitory concentration in\u00a0<i>Staphylococcus aureus\u00a0</i>and\u00a0<i>Staphylococcus epidermidis\u00a0</i>is 0.3 mg/l. An EC50 of 0.22 mg CPC/l is available for\u00a0<i>Photobacterium phosphoreum\u00a0</i>and an IC50 of 0.05 mg/l for plankton.</p> <p>The LD50 (24 h) for early life stages (postlarvae) of various freshwater and saline shrimps are between 0.13 and 3.1 mg/l. The only available LC50 (96 h) for fish is 0.01 mg/l. A 20 % inhibition of feeding was observed after 5-day exposure of<i>\u00a0Bursaphelenchus xylophilus\u00a0</i>(terrestrial nematodes) to 50 mg CPC/l.</p> <p>For quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs):</p> <p>QACs are generally white crystalline powders. Low molecular weight QACs are very soluble in water, but slightly or not at all soluble in solvents such as ether, petrol and benzene. As the molecular weight and chain lengths increases, the solubility in polar solvents (e.g. water) decreases and the solubility in non-polar solvents increases.\u00a0</p> <p>  <b>Environmental fate</b></p> <p>A major part of the QACs is discharged into wastewater and removed in the biological processes of sewage treatment plant. A 90% reduction of the QACs in the water phase of sludge has been reported and alkyl di-/ trimethyl ammonium and alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium compounds seem almost completely degraded in sewage sludge.</p> <p>However, the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of QACs is not well investigated. Only sparse data are available concerning stability, solubility and biodegradability. In general, it seems that the biodegradability decreases with increasing numbers of alkyl chains: R(CH3)3N+ &gt; R2(CH3)2N+ &gt; R3(CH3)N+ . Within each category the biodegradability seems inversely proportional to the alkyl chain length. Heterocyclic QACs are less degradable than the non-cyclic.\u00a0</p> <p>Investigations have shown that bioaccumulation of considerable dimensions will probably not take place.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Quaternary ammonium compounds and their polymers may be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. The toxicity of the quaternary ammoniums is known to be greatly reduced in the environment because of preferential binding to dissolved organics in surface water.</p> <p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure. Cloudy swelling, patchy necrosis and fatty infiltration in such visceral organs as the heart, liver and kidneys shows at death.</p> <p>\u00a0Rats fed repeatedly on a similar material (a C12-C16 alkyl derivative), over several weeks, died of inanition associated with chronic diarrhoea; at autopsy the only lesion found was focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the gastric mucosa.
