Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

There was coagulation necrosis of the skin, left eye and acute dermatitis veneta with acute passive congestion of the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys.</p> <p>Skin absorption occurs at low vapour pressure, without apparent discomfort and proceeds with the same efficiency as absorption by inhalation</p> <p>Damage to the lungs has been described following percutaneous absorption.</p> <p>Methaemoglobinaemia and haemolytic anaemia are frequently documented.</p> <p>Phenol and some of its derivatives may produce mild to severe skin irritation on repeated or prolonged contact, producing second and third degree chemical burns. Rapid cutaneous absorption may lead to systemic toxicity affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Absorption through the skin may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hyperpnoea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow.</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>For phenol, solid:</p> <p>Ingestion causes blotches on the lips and in the mouth.</p> <p>Some phenol derivatives may produce mild to severe damage within the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption may result in profuse perspiration, intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cyanosis (following the formation of methaemoglobin), hyperactivity, stupor, falling blood pressure, hypernea, abdominal pain, haemolysis, convulsions, coma and pulmonary oedema followed by pneumonia. Respiratory failure and kidney damage may follow. Severe phenol ingestions cause hypotension, coma, ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures and white coagulative chemical burns.\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0Phenol does not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation like dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol and thus does not cause a heat exhaustion-like syndrome. Phenolic groups with ortho and para positions free from substitution are reactive; this is because the ortho and para positions on the aromatic ring are highly activated by the phenolic hydroxyl group and are therefore readily substituted.</p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Solid phenol is highly toxic via ingestion, inhalation and skin contact.</p> <p>Chronic phenol poisoning is very rarely reported, but symptoms include vomiting, difficulty in swallowing, diarrhoea, lack of appetite, headache, fainting, dizziness, dark urine, mental disturbances, and possibly skin rash. Death due to liver and kidney damage may occur.</p> <p>Repeated exposure of animals to phenol vapour at concentrations ranging from 26 to 52 ppm has produced respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and neurologic toxicity.</p> <p>Administration of phenol in the drinking water of mice (2500 ppm for 103 weeks) produced an increased incidence of leukemia and lymphomas.</p> <p>Phenol has been studied in initiation/promotion protocols with a number of polycyclic hydrocarbons and has been shown to have promoting activity in the two-stage skin model</p> <p>Prolonged exposure to some derivatives of phenol may produce dermatitis, anorexia, weight loss, weakness, muscle aches and pain, liver damage, dark urine, ochronosis, skin eruptions, diarrhoea, nervous disorders with headache, salivation, fainting, increased skin and scleral pigmentation, vertigo and mental disorders. Liver and kidney damage may also ensue. Chronic phenol toxicity was first noted in medical personnel in the late 1800s when 5 and 10% phenol was used as a skin disinfectant. The term carbolic (phenol) marasmus was given to this syndrome.</p> <p>\u00a0Addition of structurally related phenolic compounds to the diet of Syrian golden hamsters induced forestomach hyperplasia and tumours. These compounds included 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-methoxphenol (BHA) (CAS RN: 25013-16-5), 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TBMP) (29759-28-2) and p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP) (98-54-4); less active were catechol (154-23-4), p-methylphenol (331-39-5), methylhydroquinone (MHQ) (95-71-6) and pyrogallol (87-66-1), whilst no activity was seen with resorcinol (108-46-3), hydroquinone (123-31-9), propylparaben (94-13-3) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (1948-33-0).</p> <p>\u00a0In autoradiographic studies, intake of BHA, TBMP, catechol, PMOP, PTBP and MHQ resulted in a significant increase in the labelling index of the forestomach epithelium, whilst PMOP induced epithelial damage and pyloric regenerative hyperplasia. Catechol, CA and PYMP induced similar but less marked alterations. Both catechol and PMOP increased the labelling index in the glandular stomach. The urinary bladder was free from histo-pathological lesions, but propylparabene, catechol, TBHQ and MHQ increased the labelling index. The authors of this study concluded that long term administration of PTBP and TBMP may be carcinogenic for hamster forestomach and that both 1-hydroxy and tert-butyl substituents may play a role in the induction of forestomach tumours.</p> <p>Hiros, M., et al: Carcinogenesis, Vol 7, pp 1285-1289; 1986</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <ul> <li>Neoprene gloves\u00a0</li> </ul>"

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen cyanide</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Dust Explosion Hazard Class 1</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Dusts fall into one of three Kst* classes. Class 1 dusts; Kst 1-200 m3/sec; Class 2 dusts; 201-299 m3/sec. Class 3 dusts; Kst 300 or more. Most agricultural dusts (grains, flour etc.) are Class 1; pharmaceuticals and other speciality chemicals are typically Class 1 or 2; most unoxidised metallic dusts are Class 3. The higher the Kst, the more energetically the dust will burn and the greater is the explosion risk and the greater is the speed of the explosion..</p> <p>Standard test conditions, used to derive the Kst, are representative of industrial conditions, but do not represent and absolute worst case.

Such reactions are more likely following repeated exposures or in persons with a pre-existing allergy to certain proteins.</p> <p>Dusts produced by proteins are capable, under certain conditions, of sensitising workers by virtue of the bodies reaction to foreign proteins. Typical allergic asthma may be rapidly produced after exposure, with symptoms may include chronic cough, sputum production, fever, myalgia, fatigue, airway obstruction; chest radiographs may show a generalised reticulonodular pattern, or basal or apical fibrosis. In addition there may be retrosternal discomfort, headache, stomach-ache and general severe dyspnoea may develop giving a clinical picture similar to that of farmer's lung and allied conditions of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. No irritation is likely after brief skin contact, but prolonged contact in the presence of moisture may result in soreness, redness, inflammation and possible ulceration of the skin. Repeated attacks may lead to permanent impairment of lung function due to fibrotic change.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Exposure to small quantities may induce hypersensitivity reactions characterised by acute bronchospasm, hives (urticaria), deep dermal wheals (angioneurotic oedema), running nose (rhinitis) and blurred vision. Anaphylactic shock and skin rash (non-thrombocytopenic purpura) may occur. An individual may be predisposed to such antibody mediated reaction if other chemical agents have caused prior sensitisation (cross-sensitivity).</p>",

After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.</span></p> <p>Experience indicates that the following polymers are suitable as glove materials for protection against undissolved, dry solids, where abrasive particles are not present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>polychloroprene. </li>\n<li>nitrile rubber. </li>\n<li>butyl rubber. </li>\n<li>fluorocaoutchouc. </li>\n<li>polyvinyl chloride. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gloves should be examined for wear and/ or degradation constantly.</p>"
