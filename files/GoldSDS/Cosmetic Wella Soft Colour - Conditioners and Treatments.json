Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The tolerance of water organisms towards pH margin and variation is diverse. Recommended pH values for test species listed in OECD guidelines are between 6.0 and almost 9. Acute testing with fish showed 96h-LC50 at about pH 3.5</p> <p><b>For alkyldimethylbenzylammonium salts (ADMBAC):</b></p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The knowledge about the biodegradation pathways of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium cationic salts is very scarce. A qualitative analysis of the metabolites that were formed in pilot activated sludge plants showed that benzoate, acetate, and tetradecyldimethylamine were formed during degradation of C14 ADMBAC. The average degradation of C14 ADMBAC in this study was 73% of the initial concentration during 36 days. The identified metabolites indicate that ADMBAC is degraded via a cleavage of the bond linking the benzene group to the alkyldimethylammonium. ADMBAC salts (C8-C14) undergo extensive ultimate biodegradation occur, and biodegradation is rapid.</p> <p>The concentration of quaternary ammonium salts did not decrease, or only decreased slightly, in an anaerobic digester.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>ADMBAC are very toxic to aquatic organisms. Some of the available data on the acute aquatic toxicity (EC/LC50) are below 1 mg/l (e.g. for the green algae\u00a0<i>Chlorella pyrenidosa</i>), but EC/LC50 values between 1 and 10 mg/l are also observed.</p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001. Torben Madsen et al: Miljoministeriet (Danish Environmental Protection Agency)</p> <p><b><br /></b></p> <p><b>For quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs):</b></p> <p>QACs are white, crystalline powders. Low molecular weight QACs are very soluble in water, but slightly or not at all soluble in solvents such as ether, petrol and benzene. As the molecular weight and chain lengths increases, the solubility in polar solvents (e.g. water) decreases and the solubility in non-polar solvents increases.\u00a0</p> <p>  <b>Environmental fate</b></p> <p>A major part of the QACs is discharged into wastewater and removed in the biological processes of sewage treatment plant. A 90% reduction of the QACs in the water phase of sludge has been reported and alkyl di-/ trimethyl ammonium and alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium compounds seem almost completely degraded in sewage sludge.</p> <p>However, the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of QACs is not well investigated. Only sparse data are available concerning stability, solubility and biodegradability. In general, it seems that the biodegradability decreases with increasing numbers of alkyl chains: R(CH3)3N+ &gt; R2(CH3)2N+ &gt; R3(CH3)N+. Within each category the biodegradability seems inversely proportional to the alkyl chain length. Heterocyclic QACs are less degradable than the non-cyclic.\u00a0</p> <p>Investigations have shown that bioaccumulation of considerable dimensions will probably not take place.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Quaternary ammonium compounds and their polymers may be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. The toxicity of the quaternary ammoniums is known to be greatly reduced in the environment because of preferential binding to dissolved organics in surface water.</p> <p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <ul> <li>Local exhaust ventilation is required where solids are handled as powders or crystals; even when particulates are relatively large, a certain proportion will be powdered by mutual friction.\u00a0</li> <li>Exhaust ventilation should be designed to prevent accumulation and recirculation of particulates in the workplace.\u00a0</li> <li>If in spite of local exhaust an adverse concentration of the substance in air could occur, respiratory protection should be considered. Such protection might consist of:\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>(a): particle dust respirators, if necessary, combined with an absorption cartridge;</p> <p>(b): filter respirators with absorption cartridge or canister of the right type;</p> <p>(c): fresh-air hoods or masks</p> <ul> <li>Build-up of electrostatic charge on the dust particle, may be prevented by bonding and grounding.\u00a0</li> <li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to efficiently remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>The material may produce respiratory tract irritation. Symptoms of pulmonary irritation may include coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, and a burning sensation.</p> <p>Unlike most organs, the lung can respond to a chemical insult or a chemical agent, by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage (inflammation of the lungs may be a consequence).</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The repair process (which initially developed to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens) may, however, cause further damage to the lungs (fibrosis for example) when activated by hazardous chemicals. Often, this results in an impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Therefore prolonged exposure to respiratory irritants may cause sustained breathing difficulties.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>Solutions of many cationic surfactants (as low as 0.1% strength) produce significant irritation of the eyes. Concentrations exceeding 10% may produce severe burns with permanent opacity and vascularisation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>The material is not thought to be a skin irritant (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Abrasive damage however, may result from prolonged exposures. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>1% solutions of many cationic surfactants produce dermal irritation and 10% solutions may be corrosive producing chemical burns.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The very bitter taste is likely to give early warning of accidental ingestion. Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure. Cloudy swelling, patchy necrosis and fatty infiltration in such visceral organs as the heart, liver and kidneys shows at death.</p> <p>\u00a0Rats fed repeatedly on a similar material (a C12-C16 alkyl derivative), over several weeks, died of inanition associated with chronic diarrhoea; at autopsy the only lesion found was focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the gastric mucosa. Repeated administration of 0.5% in the diet was lethal to rats, while 25 mg/kg was lethal to dogs; toxic signs in dogs included conditioned salivation, vomiting, enteritis, pulmonary haemorrhage and inflammation and sloughing of the mucosa.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",
