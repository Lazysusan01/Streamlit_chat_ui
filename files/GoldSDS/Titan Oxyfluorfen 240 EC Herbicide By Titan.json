Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour. A STEL is recommended to prevent mucous membrane and ocular irritation and prevention of acute depression of the central nervous system. Because of the wide variation in molecular weights of its components, the conversion of ppm to mg/m3 is approximate. Sweden recommends hexane type limits of 100 ppm and heptane and octane type limits of 300 ppm. Germany does not assign a value because of the widely differing compositions and resultant differences in toxic properties.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor (OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.042 (gasoline)</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p>",

Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis. The material is unlikely to produce an irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives .</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Inhibitors of the oxidase enzyme,\r\nhowever, do more than merely block the production of chlorophyll and heme. The\r\ninhibition of PPO by inhibitors also results in forming highly reactive\r\nmolecules that attack and destroy lipids and protein\u00a0 membranes. When a lipid\r\nmembrane is destroyed, cell becomes leaky and cell organelles dry and\r\ndisintegrate rapidly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Inhibition leads to accumulation\r\nof PPIX, the first light-absorbing chlorophyll precursor. PPGIX accumulation\r\napparently is transitory as it overflows its normal environment in the\r\nthylakoid membrane and oxidizes to PPIX. PPIX formed outside its native\r\nenvironment probably is separated from Mg chelatase and other pathway enzymes\r\nthat normally prevent accumulation of PPIX. Light absorption by PPIX apparently\r\nproduces triplet state PPIX which interacts with ground state oxygen to form\r\nsinglet oxygen. Both triplet PPIX and singlet oxygen can abstract hydrogen from\r\nunsaturated lipids, producing a lipid radical and initiating a chain reaction\r\nof lipid peroxidation. Lipids and proteins are attacked and oxidized, resulting\r\nin loss of chlorophyll and carotenoids and in leaky membranes which allows\r\ncells and cell organelles to dry and disintegrate rapidly</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">PPO Inhibitors have limited\r\ntranslocation in plants and sometimes are referred to as contact herbicides.\r\nPPO Inhibitors injure mostly broadleaf plants; however, certain PPO Inhibitors\r\nhave some activity on grasses. PPO Inhibitors usually burn plant tissues within\r\nhours or days of exposure. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Injury symptoms can occur within\r\n1 to 2 hours after exposure, appearing first as water-soaked foliage, which is\r\nfollowed by browning (necrosis) of the tissue. Symptoms will appear most\r\nquickly with bright, sunny conditions at application. Drift injury will appear\r\nas speckling on leaf tissue. The necrotic spots are sometimes surrounded by a\r\nreddish coloured ring. Injury from soil applications or residues appears as a\r\nmottled chlorosis and necrosis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">PPO Inhibitors belong to eight\r\ndifferent chemistries including diphenyl ethers, N-phenylphthalimides,\r\noxadiazoles, oxazolidinediones, phenylpyrazoles, pyrimidindiones, thiadiazoles,\r\nand triazolinones.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

However, the nature of the light-activated mechanism is still unknown.</p> <p>The photochemistry of diphenyl ethers is relevant to the dependence of their activity on light absorption.</p> <p>Substituted diphenyl ethers were studied under 300 nm irradiation in water. The major reaction pathways involved reductive dehalogenation, decarboxymethylation, reduction of nitro substituents, and cleavage of the ether linkage to yield phenols.</p> <p>for chlorophenoxy herbicides:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Residues of chlorophenoxy herbicides in the environment are the consequence of the direct application of these compounds to agricultural and non-agricultural areas. Biodegradation is the primary route of elimination from the environment; photolysis and hydrolysis also contribute to their removal.</p> <p>The chlorophenoxy herbicides are considered to have only marginal potential for leaching to groundwater In basic waters, phenoxy herbicide esters are hydrolysed to the anionic forms; in acidic waters, photodegradation or vaporisation predominates, depending on the ester.</p> <p>Chlorophenoxy herbicides may be transported in the atmosphere in the form of droplets, vapour, or powder following application by spraying.</p> <p>Chlorophenoxy herbicides may be present in food as a result of their direct application to crops; however, concentrations are normally low</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The group of acidic herbicides, including the phenoxy acids, possess functional groups that ionise in aqueous systems yielding pKa values of less than 4. The behaviour of these materials is closely correlated with their acid character. The most significant factor with respect to soil mobility is the organic content of the soil which readily absorbs these compounds. Furthermore in acidic systems these compounds are also absorbed by clay particles. The esters and ethers are expected to behave differently from the acid forms although hydrolysis may influence subsequent binding. In general the esters and ethers are considered non-persistent in the environment.</p> <p>for oxyfluorfen</p> <p>log Kow \u00a0: 4.468</p> <p><b>Environmental fate</b>:</p> <p>Soil and water: Strongly adsorbed on soil, not readily desorbed; shows negligible leaching.</p> <p>Koc from 2891 (sand) to 32381 (silty clay loam) Photodecomposition in water is rapid and on soil slow.</p> <p>Microbial action is not significant.</p> <p>Field dissipation DT 5-55 days; soil DT50 (in dark)(aerobic) 292 d, (anaerobic) 580 d approx.</p> <p>Half-life (hr) sediment \u00a0: &gt;336</p> <p><b>Breakdown in soil and groundwater:</b>\u00a0Oxyfluorfen is moderately persistent in most soil environments, with a representative field half-life of about 30 to 40 days . Oxyfluorfen is not subject to microbial degradation or hydrolysis . The main mechanism of degradation in soils may be photodegradation and evaporation/codistillation in moist soils . In laboratory studies, its soil half-life was 6 months, indicating very low rates of microbial degradation . Oxyfluorfen is very well-sorbed to most soils . Soil binding is highest in soils with high organic matter and clay content . Once oxyfluorfen is adsorbed to soil particles, it is not readily removed . It is practically insoluble in water, and therefore is unlikely to be appreciably mobile in most instances, unless the sorptive capacity of the soil is exceeded. Oxyfluorfen did not leach below 4 inches in any soil except sand .\u00a0</p> <p><b>Breakdown in water:</b>\u00a0In water, oxyfluorfen is rapidly decomposed by light . Because oxyfluorfen is nearly insoluble in water and has a tendency to adsorb to soil, it will be sorbed to suspended particles or sediments .\u00a0</p> <p><b>Breakdown in vegetation:</b>\u00a0There is very little movement of oxyfluorfen within treated plants. It is not readily metabolised by plants, but since it is not readily taken up by roots, residues in plants are generally very low .

Circulatory collapse may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute exposure to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and its derivatives and analogues may produce headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, raised temperature, low blood pressure, leucocytotoxic heart and liver injury and convulsions.</p> <p>All animal species tested seem to react similarly and there is only a minor difference in potency between various salts and esters of 2,4-D either as pure chemicals or as commercial preparations although the free acid exhibits a somewhat higher toxicity. In several species systemic intoxication after massive doses produces ventricular fibrillation or, if death is delayed, motor disturbances. A disinclination to move progresses to rigidity of skeletal muscles (myotonia) and ataxia (involuntary muscle movement). Severe cases show progressive apathy, depression, muscle weakness of the hind limbs, periodic clonic spasms and coma. Subacute poisonings are characterised by anorexia, eye and nose irritation, and possible epistaxis or bleeding from the mouth. Clinical reports of poisonings are rare although protracted peripheral neuropathies with myopathy appear to be characteristic. Significant cumulative toxicity does not occur with 2,4-D and most of its congeners are not metabolised and do not accumulate in body fat or in the food chain. Urinary excretion is slow with a plasma half-life of about 33 hours.</p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.
