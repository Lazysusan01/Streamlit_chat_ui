Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Transport and distribution of nickel particulates between different environmental compartments, is strongly influenced by particle size. Fine particulate matter has a longer residence time in the environment and is carried a long distance from its source; larger particles are deposited near the emission source. Atmospheric residence time for nickel particulates is estimated to be 5.4-7.9 days. Water solubility and bioavailability is affected by soil pH; decrease in pH generally mobilises nickel, thus acid rain can mobilise nickel from the soil and increase nickel concentrations in ground water. Nickel bioaccumulates in the food chain but is not bioconcentrated.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Nickel 50 ug/l (UK max.)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a020 ug/l (WHO guideline)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Soil Guidelines:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Dutch Criteria: 35 mg/kg (target)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0210 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
