The acute lethal effects occur at levels exceeding 500000 ppm whilst the threshold for cardiac sensitisation occurs at about 75000 ppm. Repeated exposures at 50000 ppm for 13 weeks did not produce significant toxicity in animals. Limited studies have shown the substance not to be a carcinogen, or to exhibit mutagenic effects. Exposures up to 300000 ppm and 40000 ppm did not produce teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits respectively. The workplace environmental exposure level (WEEL), recommended by the AIHA, is thought to be protective against cardiac sensitisation and systemic injury.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>May act as a simple asphyxiants; these are gases which, when present in high concentrations, reduce the oxygen content in air below that required to support breathing, consciousness and life; loss of consciousness, with death by suffocation may rapidly occur in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.</p> <p><b>CARE</b>: Most simple asphyxiants are odourless or possess low odour and there is no warning on entry into an oxygen deficient atmosphere. If there is any doubt, oxygen content can be checked simply and quickly. It may not be appropriate to only recommend an exposure standard for simple asphyxiants rather it is essential that sufficient oxygen be maintained. Air normally has 21 percent oxygen by volume, with 18 percent regarded as minimum under normal atmospheric pressure to maintain consciousness / life. At pressures significantly higher or lower than normal atmospheric pressure, expert guidance should be sought.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Exposure to high concentrations of fluorocarbons may produce cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due sensitisation of the heart to adrenalin or noradrenalin. Deaths associated with exposures to fluorocarbons (specifically halogenated aliphatics) have occurred in occupational settings and in inhalation of bronchodilator drugs.</p> <p>Bronchospasm consistently occurs in human subjects inhaling fluorocarbons. At a measured concentration of 1700 ppm of one of the commercially available aerosols there is a biphasic change in ventilatory capacity, the first reduction occurring within a few minutes and the second delayed up to 30 minutes. Most subjects developed bradycardia (reduced pulse rate).</p> <p>Bradycardia is encountered in dogs when administration is limited to upper respiratory tract (oropharyngeal and nasal areas). Cardiac arrhythmias can be experimentally induced in animals (species dependency is pronounced with dogs and monkeys requiring lesser amounts of fluorocarbon FC-11 than rats or mice). Sensitivity is increased by injection of adrenalin or cardiac ischaemia/necrosis or pulmonary thrombosis/bronchitis. The cardiotoxic effects of the fluorocarbons originate from irritation of the respiratory tract which in turn reflexively influences the heart rate (even prior to absorption of the fluorocarbon) followed by direct depression of the heart after absorption.</p> <p>Exposure to fluorocarbon thermal decomposition products may produce flu-like symptoms including chills, fever, weakness, muscular aches, headache, chest discomfort, sore throat and dry cough. Complete recovery usually occurs within 24 hours of exposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>Symptoms of asphyxia (suffocation) may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and ringing in the ears. If the asphyxia is allowed to progress, there may be nausea and vomiting, further physical weakness and unconsciousness and, finally, convulsions, coma and death. Significant concentrations of the non-toxic gas reduce the oxygen level in the air. As the amount of oxygen is reduced from 21 to 14 volume %, the pulse rate accelerates and the rate and volume of breathing increase. The ability to maintain attention and think clearly is diminished and muscular coordination is somewhat disturbed. As oxygen decreases from 14-10% judgement becomes faulty; severe injuries may cause no pain. Muscular exertion leads to rapid fatigue. Further reduction to 6% may produce nausea and vomiting and the ability to move may be lost. Permanent brain damage may result even after resuscitation at exposures to this lower oxygen level. Below 6% breathing is in gasps and convulsions may occur. Inhalation of a mixture containing no oxygen may result in unconsciousness from the first breath and death will follow in a few minutes.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing. Before starting consider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Acute intoxication by halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons appears to take place over two stages. Signs of a reversible narcosis are evident in the first stage and in the second stage signs of injury to organs may become evident, a single organ alone is (almost) never involved.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p><br /></p> <p>Although the material is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may produce transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn).</p> <p>Direct contact with the eye may not cause irritation because of the extreme volatility of the gas; however concentrated atmospheres may produce irritation after brief exposures..</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In common with other halogenated aliphatics, fluorocarbons may cause dermal problems due to a tendency to remove natural oils from the skin causing irritation and the development of dry, sensitive skin. They do not appear to be appreciably absorbed.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Vapourising liquid causes rapid cooling and contact may cause cold burns, frostbite, even through normal gloves. Frozen skin tissues are painless and appear waxy and yellow. \u00a0Signs and symptoms of frost-bite may include \"pins and needles\", paleness followed by numbness, a hardening an stiffening of the skin, a progression of colour changes in the affected area, (first white, then mottled and blue and eventually black; on recovery, red, hot, painful and blistered).</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Overexposure is unlikely in this form.</p> <p>Not normally a hazard due to physical form of product.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments\u00a0</p> <p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "No effects have been seen in rats exposed to up to 50,000 ppm for 90 days. It is not teratogenic in rats or rabbits.  Short term screening tests for carcinogenicity have proved negative.  No long term effects were noted when administered by gavage to rats at a dose of 300 mg/kg/day for one year and the rats held for the remainder of their life span.  [CIG]|55r33#? <p><br /></p> <p>It is generally accepted that the fluorocarbons are less toxic than the corresponding halogenated aliphatic based on chlorine. Repeated inhalation exposure to the fluorocarbon FC-11 does not produce pathologic lesions of the liver and other visceral organs in experimental animals. There has been conjecture in non-scientific publications that fluorocarbons may cause leukemia, cancer, sterility and birth defects; these have not been verified by current research. The high incidence of cancer, spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies amongst hospital personnel, repeatedly exposed to fluorine-containing general anaesthetics, has caused some scientists to call for a lowering of the fluorocarbon exposure standard to 5 ppm since some are mutagens.</p> <p>Principal route of occupational exposure to the gas is by inhalation.\u00a0</p>",
