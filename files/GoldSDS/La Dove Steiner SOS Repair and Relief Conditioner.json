Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Activated charcoal should be prescribed in a case of acute overdose. Otherwise the treatment should target specific signs and symptoms such as hypertension, agitation, seizures, and hyperthermia. Rapid supportive treatment may reduce mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>Supportive therapy</strong></p>\n<p>Acute intoxication usually presents with increased sensitivity to sensorial stimuli and paranoia. As such, decreasing the patient's level of stimulation (keep voice low, dim lights, minimise touch) and working with the patient's paranoid state (reduce eye contact, respect personal space, do not approach from behind) is important.</p>\n<p>As in all cases of suspected poisoning, follow the ABCDEs of emergency medicine (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure), then the ABCDEs of toxicology (antidotes, basics, change absorption, change distribution, change elimination).</p>\n<p>Decontamination with gastric lavage may be appropriate in cases of recent ingestion.</p>\n<p>Monitor vital signs and hydrate with intravenous fluids.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal related insomnia may be treated with trazodone (75-200 mg), hydroxyzine (25-50 mg), or diphenhydramine (50-100 mg) at bedtime.</p>\n<p>Benzodiazepines should be avoided unless the patient is also in detox from alcohol/benzodiazepines/opiates.</p>\n<p>Neuroleptics may be used for the symptomatic treatment of psychosis.</p>\n<p>Physical restraints may be required in certain cases.</p>\n<p>Common withdrawal symptoms may include dysphoria, anxiety, and irritability, decreased energy (manifested as reported fatigue, psychomotor retardation and hypersomnia), hyperphagia, decreased concentration, and paranoia. The withdrawal symptoms are uncomfortable but not life threatening; consequently, no current recommendations for a stimulant-detoxification regimen are available.</p>\n<p>Stimulant withdrawal dysphoria is common and does not in itself represent an indication for an antidepressant. However, a thorough assessment (including consideration of an antidepressant) is recommended for persistent (longer than a week) depressive symptoms at a level of moderate or severe or associated with suicidal ideation/attempts.</p>\n<p>Medscape</p> <p>Treat symptomatically.</p>|Poisoning should be treated by inducing emesis or by gastric lavage; anticonvulsants may be needed [Martindale]",

The calculated photodegradation half-lives for three benzaldehyde derivatives in this chemical category are in the narrow range from 4.7 hours for\u00a0<i>m-</i>methoxy-<i>p-</i>hydroxybenzaldehyde to 7.2 hours for the less substituted derivative benzaldehyde. The relative half-lives reflect the increased reactivity of a phenolic OH group. The half-lives for the aldehydes are shorter than those for the corresponding benzyl and benzoate esters in this category (12.7 for methyl benzoate to 64.5 hours for methyl\u00a0<i>p</i>-methylbenzoate) Generally, the carboxylate function of the ester is more stable to reaction with hydroxyl radicals than The calculated half lives for hydroxyl radical reactions range from 4.7 to 64.5 hours. The calculated photodegradation half-lives for three benzaldehyde derivatives in this chemical category are in the narrow range from 4.7 hours for\u00a0<i>m-</i>methoxy-<i>p</i>hydroxybenzaldehyde to 7.2 hours for the less substituted derivative benzaldehyde . The relative half-lives reflect the increased reactivity of a phenolic OH group. The half-lives for the aldehydes are shorter than those for the corresponding benzyl and benzoate esters in this category (12.7 for methyl benzoate to 64.5 hours for methyl\u00a0<i>p</i>-methylbenzoate). Generally, the carboxylate function of the ester is more stable to reaction with hydroxyl radicals than is the aldehyde function. The presence of an aromatic phenol function capable of undergoing ready hydrogen abstraction of the phenolic hydroxyl group decreases predicted photodegradation half-lives. Therefore, the methyl, pentyl and benzyl esters of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid have calculated half-lives of 11.6, 7.6, and 7.4 hours, respectively</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Benzaldehydes in this group cannot hydrolyse. However, they are likely to be slowly oxidized to their corresponding acids. The calculated hydrolysis half-lives for esters range from 20 days at pH 8 and 198 days at pH 7 for benzyl acetate to 1.1 years at pH 8 and 10.8 years at pH 7 for methyl\u00a0<i>p</i>-methylbenzoate. Benzyl acetate, like several other benzyl esters, was shown to be 50% hydrolysed in 2 hours at pH 7.5 in the presence of pancreatin in an\u00a0<i>in vitro\u00a0</i>simulation experiment . These esters are all expected to be readily hydrolysed\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>All are readily and ultimately biodegradable using a standard OECD 301B test or 301F protocol. The parent acid benzoic acid, its sodium salt, and 2-hydroxybenzoic acid were all readily biodegradable in a COD (chemical oxygen demand) test. Since hydrolysis of the esters and ready oxidation of the aldehydes yields corresponding acid derivatives, the data on benzoic acid, its sodium salt, and 2-hydroxybenzoic acid validate the observations that the aldehydes and esters in this chemical category are readily biodegradable.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Experimental data indicate a low to moderate toxicity for the benzyl derivatives. Benzyl esters and 2-hydroxybenzoate esters (salicylates) exhibit higher acute toxicity to fish than do benzoate esters or benzaldehyde derivatives. Measured values for benzyl and salicylate esters are in the 1-5 mg/l range with salicylates being slightly more toxic. Benzoate ester and benzaldehyde derivatives exhibit 96-hour LC50 values above 10 mg/L</p> <p>Benzaldehyde derivatives exhibit lower acute toxicity compared to the parent substance.</p> <p>Fish LC50 (14-d): guppy 0.17 mg/l (benzaldehyde)</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): guppy 88-116 mg/l (m-methoxy-p-hydroxybenzaldehyde)</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): 13-23.5 mg/l (benzaldehyde, p-methoxybenzaldehyde, m-methoxy-p-hydroxybenzaldehyde; estimated values).</p> <p>Acute toxicity for aquatic invertebrates parallels that for fish in the benzyl chemical category.
