Cadmium(II) adsorbs to sediments. Once in an aquatic\r\nenvironment cadmium is highly mobile; its dissolved species are highly labile\r\nand are first to be released, for example, when salinity is increased in\r\nestuaries. In fresh water, cadmium toxicity is influenced by water hardness\r\n(the harder the water, the lower the toxicity). Cadmium can bioaccumulate and\r\nbioconcentrate in the food chain. Biomagnification in terrestrial food chains\r\nis not expected.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cadmium is more mobile in aquatic environments than most other\r\nheavy metals (e.g., lead). In most natural surface waters, the affinities of\r\ncomplexing ligands for cadmium generally follow the order of humic acids &gt;\r\nCO3 2- &gt; OH- &gt; Cl- &gt; SO4 2-. In unpolluted natural waters, most\r\ncadmium transported in the water column will exist in the dissolved state as\r\nthe hydrated ion Cd(H2O)6 2+. Minor amounts of cadmium are transported with the\r\ncoarse particulates, and only a small fraction is transported with the\r\ncolloids. In unpolluted waters, cadmium can be removed from solution by\r\nexchange of cadmium for calcium in the lattice structure of carbonate minerals.\r\nIn polluted organic-rich waters, adsorption of cadmium by humic substances and\r\nother organic complexing agents plays a dominant role in transport,\r\npartitioning, and remobilization of cadmium. Cadmium concentration in water is\r\ninversely related to the pH and the concentration of organic material in the\r\nwater. Because cadmium exists only in the +2 oxidation state in water, aqueous\r\ncadmium is not strongly influenced by the oxidizing or reducing potential of\r\nthe water. However, under reducing conditions, cadmium may form cadmium\r\nsulfide, which is poorly soluble and tends to precipitate. Free (ionic) cadmium\r\nseems to be the toxic form and becomes much more prevalent at low salinity .\r\nCadmium has a relatively long residence time in aquatic systems. In Lake\r\nMichigan, a mean residence time of 4-10 years was calculated for cadmium\r\ncompared to 22 years calculated for mercury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Precipitation and sorption to mineral surfaces, hydrous metal\r\noxides, and organic materials are the most important processes for removal of\r\ncadmium to bed sediments. Humic acid is the major component of sediment\r\nresponsible for adsorption. Sorption increases as the pH increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sediment bacteria may also assist in the partitioning of cadmium\r\nfrom water to sediments. Both cadmium-sensitive and cadmium-resistant bacteria\r\nreduced the cadmium concentration in the water column from 1 ppm to between 0.2\r\nand 0.6 ppm, with a corresponding increase in cadmium concentration in the\r\nsediments in the simulated environment. Studies indicate that concentrations of\r\ncadmium in sediments are at least one order of magnitude higher than in the\r\noverlying water. The mode of sorption of cadmium to sediments is important in\r\ndetermining its disposition to remobilize. Cadmium associated with carbonate\r\nminerals, precipitated as stable solid compounds or co-precipitated with\r\nhydrous iron oxides, is less likely to be mobilized by resuspension of\r\nsediments or biological activity. Cadmium that is adsorbed to mineral surfaces\r\nsuch as clay, or to organic materials, is more easily bioaccumulated or\r\nreleased in the dissolved state when the sediment is disturbed. Cadmium may\r\nredissolve from sediments under varying ambient conditions of pH,salinity, and\r\nredox potential. Cadmium is not known to form volatile compounds in the aquatic\r\nenvironment, so partitioning from water to the atmosphere does not occur.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In soils, pH, oxidation-reduction reactions, and formation of\r\ncomplexes are important factors affecting the mobility of cadmium. Cadmium can\r\nparticipate in exchange reactions on the negatively charged surface of clay\r\nminerals. In acid soils, the reaction is reversible. However, adsorption increases\r\nwith pH and may become irreversible. Cadmium also may precipitate as insoluble\r\ncadmium compounds, or form complexes or chelates by interaction with organic\r\nmatter. Available data suggest that organic matter is more effective than\r\ninorganic constituents in keeping cadmium unavailable. Examples of cadmium\r\ncompounds found in soil are Cd3 (PO4)2, CdCO3, and Cd(OH)2. These compounds are\r\nformed as the pH rises. It has been found that about 90% of cadmium in soils\r\nremains in the top 15 cm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aquatic and terrestrial organisms bioaccumulate cadmium. Cadmium\r\nconcentrates in freshwater and marine animals to concentrations hundreds to\r\nthousands of times higher than in the water. Reported bioconcentration factors\r\n(BCFs) range from 113 to 18,000 for invertebrates, from 3 to 4,190 for fresh\r\nwater aquatic organisms, and from 5 to 3,160 for saltwater aquatic organisms .\r\nBioconcentration in fish depends on the pH and the humus content of the water.\r\nCadmium (not an estrogen mimic) has also been shown to cause increased vitellogenesis\r\nin female Atlantic croaker (<i>Micropogonias undulatus</i>), but this is\r\nthought to be caused by direct toxic action on the pituitary, leading to\r\naltered secretion of gonadotropin hormone.Because of their high ability to\r\naccumulate metals, some aquatic plants have been suggested for use in pollution\r\ncontrol. For example, it has been suggested that the rapidly-growing water\r\nhyacinth\u00a0<i>Eichhornia crussipes\u00a0</i>could be used to remove cadmium\r\nfrom domestic and industrial effluents. The data indicate that cadmium\r\nbioaccumulates in all levels of the food chain. Cadmium accumulation has been\r\nreported in grasses and food crops, and in earthworms, poultry, cattle, horses,\r\nand wildlife. The metal burden of a crop depends on uptake by the root system,\r\ndirect foliar uptake and translocation within the plant, and surface deposition\r\nof particulate matter. In general, cadmium accumulates in the leaves of plants\r\nand, therefore, is more of a risk in leafy vegetables grown in contaminated\r\nsoil than in seed or root crops.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since cadmium accumulates largely in the liver and kidneys of\r\nvertebrates and not in the muscle tissue and intestinal absorption of cadmium\r\nis low, biomagnification through the food chain may not be significant. In a\r\nstudy of marine organisms from the Tyrrhenian Sea, no evidence of cadmium\r\nbiomagnification was found along pelagic or benthic food webs. Although some\r\ndata indicate increased cadmium concentrations in animals at the top of the\r\nfood chain, comparisons among animals at different trophic levels are difficult,\r\nand the data available on biomagnification are not conclusive.\r\n\u00a0Nevertheless, uptake of cadmium from soil by feed crops may result in\r\nhigh levels of cadmium in beef and poultry (especially in the liver and\r\nkidneys). This accumulation of cadmium in the food chain has important\r\nimplications for human exposure to cadmium, whether or not significant\r\nbiomagnification occurs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking water standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">5 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">3 ug/l (WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil Guidelines: Dutch Criteria:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">0.8 mg/kg (target)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">12 mg/kg (intervention)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air Quality Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">&lt;1-5 ng/m3 (rural areas)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a010-20 ng/m3 (urban and industrial areas) \u00a0(WHO\r\nGuidelines)</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>|BCF  : 2.18-250000|Fish LC50 (96 h); 4.2-6.9 mg/L|Invertebrate LC50 (96 h): 11 mg/L|Degradation Biological: sig|processes Abiotic: photodeg",

Evidence for added risk of carcinoma of the lung and prostate has been reported amongst smelter workers but exposure to other toxic fumes, gases and dusts is a confounding factor. Most of the data on cadmium levels responsible for these observed effects indicated exposures above the former TLV ceiling of 0.1 mg/m3 for cadmium fume. It is anticipated that the total dust recommendation will prevent the development of preclinical kidney dysfunction and that the respirable fraction recommendation will protect the lower respiratory tract from the accumulation of cadmium burden that might directly act on the lung as a carcinogen. It is also expected that the recommendations will protect workers from metal fume fever. The concentration of respirable dust for application of this limit is to be determined from the fraction that penetrates a separator whose size collection efficiency is described by a cumulative log normal function with a median aerodynamic volume of 4.0 um (+-) 0.3 um and with a geometric standard deviation of 1.5 um (+-) 0.1 um, i.e. less than 5 um.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material, during the course of normal handling, may produce severely toxic effects; these may be fatal.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pyrophoric compounds may decompose giving rise to potent irritants of the respiratory tract.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of freshly formed metal oxide particles sized below 1.5 microns and generally between 0.02 to 0.05 microns may result in \"metal fume fever\". Symptoms may be delayed for up to 12 hours and begin with the sudden onset of thirst, and a sweet, metallic or foul taste in the mouth. Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur. Tolerance to the fumes develops rapidly, but is quickly lost. All symptoms usually subside within 24-36 hours following removal from exposure.</p> <p>Cadmium is absorbed more efficiently from the respiratory tract than from the gastrointestinal tract. Three clinical stages are recognised in dog. An acute pulmonary oedema (within 24 hours), proliferative interstitial pneumonitis (3rd-10th day) and permanent lung damage (consisting of perivascular and peribronchial fibrosis) have been identified - a similar sequence (though not permanent damage) is inferred from human autopsy material. The inhalation of 40 mg of cadmium with pulmonary retention of 4 mg is estimated to be fatal in man. Following absorption, organs accumulate low molecular weight proteins (metallothioneins - MTNs) which avidly bind metals such as cadmium, zinc and mercury. Single intravenous doses of cadmium-MTN complex produce necrosis and sloughing of renal tubular cells in rabbits. Renal (kidney) injury is also common amongst workers in cadmium industries exposed both acutely and chronically. Acute massive exposures may result in acute renal necrosis whereas prolonged low level exposures commonly produce renal tubular dysfunction characterised by low grade proteinuria (protein in the urine).</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>It has either been demonstrated or it is expected that when the material is applied to the eye(s) of animals, it produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Contact with the eye, by metal dusts, may produce mechanical abrasion or foreign body penetration of the eyeball.</p> <p>Pyrophoric compounds may produce thermal burns on contact with the eye.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Pyrophoric compounds may cause thermal burns of the skin with local effects ranging from redness to swelling and deep burns with tissue destruction. Systemic effects may include primary or secondary shock.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be seriously damaging to the health of the individual; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Pyrophoric compounds may produce gastrointestinal damage resulting from local generation of heat.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of cadmium salts produces prompt vomiting and are not retained. For this reason exposure by this route tends to be less harmful than exposure by inhalation. Although as little as 10-20 mg of soluble cadmium has produced severe toxic syndrome following ingestion, lethal doses probably comprise several hundred milligram by the oral route. Ingestion may cause excessive salivation, nausea, persistent vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, the material may be regarded as carcinogenic to humans. There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in cancer on the basis of:</p> <p>- appropriate long-term animal studies</p> <p>- other relevant information</p><html><head><title></title> </head> <body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" leftmargin=5 topmargin=5 rightmargin=5 bottommargin=5> <font size=2 color=\"#000000\" face=\"Arial\"> <div><font color=\"#000000\">Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation and if swallowed.&nbsp;</font></div> </font> </body></html> <p>Serious damage (clear functional disturbance or morphological change which may have toxicological significance) is likely to be caused by repeated or prolonged exposure. As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for human fertility, generally on the basis that results in animal studies provide sufficient evidence to cause a strong suspicion of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In chronic cadmium poisoning, bone softening (osteomalacia), radiological decreases in bone density, high levels of calcium in the urine (hyper- calcinuria) and renal stones reflect disturbance in calcium metabolism. Although this disturbance may reflect cadmium induced renal tubular damage there is evidence in rats that direct action on the bone may produce metabolic breakdown of collagen (the main structural protein in bone). Animals sometimes exhibit significant hypertension after chronic exposure to cadmium in drinking water. Epidemiological studies suggest a relationship between airborne cadmium and human cardiovascular disease though this is still equivocal. From a diagnostic point of view the formation of a yellow ring as part of the tooth structure in chronically exposed humans may be significant. Heavy smoking has been reported to considerably increase tissue calcium levels and would appear to increase the risk of cumulative toxic effects. Repeated or prolonged exposure may result in a loss of smell, ulceration of the nose, pulmonary emphysema and mild anaemia. Occupational exposure to cadmium (in the form of the oxide) may increase the risk of prostate, respiratory and genito-urinary cancers in humans. In one follow-up study of an investigation of cadmium-nickel workers and cadmium-copper alloy factory workers, additional cases of nasopharyngeal, colorectal, prostatic and lung-cancer were reported. In a further study of cadmium smelter workers a significant trend was noted for cumulative cadmium exposures and lung cancer mortality. This relationship has not been seen in other follow-up studies. Male rats continuously exposed to cadmium chloride aerosols developed dose-related increases in adenocarcinomas, epidermoid (squamous cell) carcinomas and mucoepidermoid carcinomas of the lung. When introduced through intratracheal instillation, cadmium chloride induced invasive prostatic carcinomas in the rat.</p> <p>Metallic dusts generated by the industrial process give rise to a number of potential health problems. The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
