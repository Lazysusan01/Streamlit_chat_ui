Pre-adapted microorganisms can degrade glycerol rapidly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.<br /> Bioaccumulation: Based on Log Kow -1.76, glycerol will have a low bioaccumulation potential and is not expected to bioaccumulate.<br /> Photodegradation: The calculated half-life for the photo-oxidation (reaction with hydroxyl radicals) of glycerol in air is 6.8 hours (EPIWIN vs 3.04).<br /> Stability in Water:\u00a0 Glycerol does not contain functional groups that are expected to react with water.<br /> Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0 From the EQC model (Mackay level III), it can be deduced that 100% of glycerol will end up in the water phase.

The lowest LC50 for fish is a 24-h LC50 of &gt;5000 mg/l for Carassius auratus (Goldfish) and for aquatic invertebrates, a 24 h EC50 of &gt;10000 mg/l for Daphnia magna is the lowest EC50. Several tests on algae are available, which suggest very low toxicity to a range of species, however their validity is uncertain. A QSAR prediction for the 96h EC50 to algae was 78000 mg/l. No toxicity towards the microorganism Pseudomonas putida was observed at 10000 mg/l after exposure for 16 hours. No long-term aquatic toxicity data is available. Screening studies are available on frog and carp embryos which indicate some effects on growth and hatching rates respectively at very high concentrations of glycerol, &gt;7000 mg/l.

OSHA concluded that the nuisance particulate limit would protect the worker form kidney damage and perhaps, testicular effects.<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.
