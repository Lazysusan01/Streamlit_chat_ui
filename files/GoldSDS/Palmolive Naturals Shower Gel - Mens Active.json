In addition they function as hair conditioning agents,\r\nfunctional surfactants, thickeners and bacteriostatic agents.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Amphoteric surfactants\r\n(amphiphiles) have dual functional groups (both acidic and basic groups) in the\r\nsame molecule. They are polar substances that have a high solubility in water\r\nbut a poor solubility in most organic solvents. They are electrically neutral\r\n(zwitterions) but carry positive and negative charges on different atoms in an\r\naqueous solution. They exist mostly as zwitterions in a certain pH range but\r\ndepending on the pH value, the substances can have anionic or cationic\r\nproperties outside the zwitterionic range. In the presence of acids, they will\r\naccept the hydrogen ions but they will donate hydrogen ions to the solution in\r\nthe presence of bases, which balances the pH. Such actions make buffer\r\nsolutions which resist change to the pH. Amphoteric (amphiphilic) surfactants\r\nchange their charge according to the pH of the solution; this affects\r\nproperties such as foaming, wetting and detergency through a surface action that\r\nexerts both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. In biochemistry amphoteric\r\nsurfactants are used as\u00a0 detergents for purifying, cleansing and for their\u00a0\r\nantimicrobial effects. Alkylbetaines and amino-oxides are typical amphoteric\r\nsurfactants.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines are primarily used in\r\npersonal care products like, e.g. hair shampoos, liquid soaps, and cleansing\r\nlotions. Other applications include all-purpose cleaning agents, hand\r\ndishwashing agents, and special textile detergents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In chemistry a betaine is any\r\nneutral chemical compound with a positively charged cationic functional group\r\nsuch as a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation (generally: onium ions)\r\nwhich bears no hydrogen atom and with a negatively charged functional group\r\nsuch as a carboxylate group which may not be adjacent to the cationic site. A\r\nbetaine thus may be a specific type of zwitterion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In biological systems, many\r\nnaturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized\r\nor taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic\r\nstress, drought, high salinity or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation\r\nof betaines, non-perturbing to enzyme function, protein structure and membrane\r\nintegrity, permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects\r\nof dehydration. It is also a methyl donor of increasingly recognised\r\nsignificance in biology.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines may function to reduce\r\nthe concentration of homocysteine, a homolog of the naturally occurring amino\r\nacid cysteine. High circulating levels of homocysteine may be harmful to blood\r\nvessels and thus contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. This\r\nhypothesis is controversial as it has not yet been established whether\r\nhomocysteine itself is harmful or is just an indicator of increased risk for\r\ncardiovascular disease</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phosphonium betaines are\r\nintermediates in the Wittig reaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The addition of betaine to\r\npolymerase chain reactions improves the amplification of DNA by reducing the\r\nformation of secondary structure in GC-rich regions. The addition of betaine\r\nhas been reported to enhance the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction\r\nby eliminating the base pair composition dependence of DNA melting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most betaines are characterized\r\nby a fully quaternised nitrogen. In alkyl betaines, one of the methyl groups in\r\nthe \u2018betaine\u2019 structure (<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylglycine) is replaced by a linear\r\nalkyl chain. A special type of betaines is the hydroxysulfobetaines in which\r\nthe carboxylic group of alkyl betaine is replaced by sulfonate and a\r\nhydroxy-group is inserted in the hydrophilic part of the molecule. In\r\nalkylamido betaines, an amide group is inserted as a link between the\r\nhydrophobic alkyl chain and the hydrophilic moiety. The most commonly used\r\nalkylamido betaine is alkylamidopropyl betaine (e.g., cocoamidopropyl betaine),\r\nwhereas alkylamidoethyl betaines are used in smaller amounts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Representative structures include</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RN+(CH3)2CH2COO- (alkyl betaine)\r\nand </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RC(=O)NH(CH3)2N+(CH3)CH3-COO-\r\n(alkylamidopropyl betaine)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines and closely related\r\nsultaines are \"pseudo-amphoteric\" surfactants as the nitrogen moiety\r\nalways has a net positive charge and the molecules can never become anionic at\r\nhigh pHs</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines/ sultaines typically\r\ncontain 6-8% salt (as sodium chloride for example) as by-products of their\r\nsynthesis. These salts act to enlarge the effective size of the surfactant\r\nmicelles and thus viscosity increases</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since betaines/ sultaines\r\npermanently have positively charged nitrogen, the negatively charged end of the\r\nanionic surfactant associates with it to form a large surfactant complex and\r\nthe viscosity increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These surfactants also have other\r\nbenefits when used in shampoos; they improve foam and can increase hair\r\nconditioning due to their substantively to hair. It has also been reported\r\n(controversially) that they can actually decrease the irritation potential of\r\nanionics (once again due to the formation of a surfactant complex) </span></p>",

It contains one lipophilic part coming from the hydrocarbon chain of the coco fatty acid and a hydrophilic part consisting of the quaternary inner salt. The nitrogen in betaine is always quaternary, i.e. it is attached to four other atoms. That makes the substance act like a cationic surfactant in an acid solution, whereas it in an alkaline solution will not carry any net charge but continue to form its inner salt, it does not become a negatively charged ion. The substance is an amphoteric that thus does not act as zwitterions.

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For cationic surfactants:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Although cationic surfactants will sorb onto sludge particles and eventually reach the digester during the treatment of wastewater sludge, there is very limited information about the biodegradability of these compounds under anoxic conditions. It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.\u00a0</p> <p>The numerous studies of aquatic toxicity, many of which were conducted in natural waters with and without added effluents, indicate that the source and composition of the test water dramatically affects the toxicity of the test substance. These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants.\u00a0</p> <p>Zwitterionic (amphoteric) substances, such as betaines, sulfobetaines  and taurines, may be phytotoxic. Because they are implicated in the  disruption of cell membranes,\u00a0 toxic effects on marine flora and fauna  (of a secondary nature) may ensue.<br />Surfactants show a complex  solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer concentration, and  hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting value at the  critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains approximately constant  as the total concentration is further increased. For ecotoxicological  models requiring a solubility value, the critical micelle concentration  is therefore the appropriate parameter describing water solubility of  surface active materials<br />Surfactants can form dispersions or  emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic toxicity studies is  difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution preparation. Micelle  formation can result in an overestimation of the bioavailable fraction  even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This presents significant  problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test results for surface  active materials. The so-called the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  is related to surface tension produced by the\u00a0 substance and is key  value for actual water solubility of the substance.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The primary biodegradability of betaines approaches 100% as, e.g., the loss of surface-activity attained 100% for C12 alkyl betaine, 98% for cocoamidopropyl betaine, and 96 and 100% for C14-15 hydroxysulfobetaine. The results from ultimate biodegradability tests of alkyl betaines show some variation with degradation percentages below and above the pass level for ready biodegradability. However, taken as a whole, \u00a0both alkyl betaines and cocoalkylamido betaines can be regarded as readily biodegradable. In contrast the hydroxysulfobetaines are probably not readily biodegradable in standard screening tests as indicated by a biodegradability of 40 and 47% of ThOD in the closed bottle test.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The knowledge about the biodegradability of betaines under anoxic conditions is relatively scarce. \u00a0Literature searches indicates that sulfate-reducing marine bacteria belonging to the genus\u00a0<i>Desulfobacterium</i>\u00a0are able to grow on betaine with the stoichiometric formation of\u00a0<i>N,N</i>-dimethylglycine. One study indicated that betaine was anaerobically degraded to methylamine in sewage sludge at a betaine concentration of 2 g/l and a solids concentration of 3.3 g/l. The anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine was examine by using the ISO 11734 screening test. Under the methanogenic test conditions, the ultimate biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine attained 45 and 75% of ThGP after 28 and 56 days, respectively, at the applied test concentration of 14.4 mg C/l\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of betaines varies considerably, even within the same species, which is particularly evident by evaluating the EC50 values determined for the green alga\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus</i>. For this species, the EC50 obtained in tests with cocoamidopropyl betaine are between 0.55 and 48 mg/l. The geometric mean of the EC50 obtained for\u00a0<i>S. subspicatus\u00a0</i>is 3.1 mg/l, when the values 0.55, 1.84, and 30 mg/l are used . The EC/LC50 of alkyl and cocoamidopropyl betaines towards crustaceans and fish are between 1 and 100 mg/l.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>1% solutions of many cationic surfactants produce dermal irritation and 10% solutions may be corrosive producing chemical burns.</p> <p>Zwitterionic (amphoteric) surfactants appear to decrease skin barrier function to some extent.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although ingestion is not thought\r\nto produce harmful effects (as classified under EC Directives), the material\r\nmay still be damaging to the health of the individual, following ingestion,\r\nespecially where pre-existing organ (e.g liver, kidney) damage is evident.\r\nPresent definitions of harmful or toxic substances are generally based on doses\r\nproducing mortality rather than those producing morbidity (disease, ill-health).\r\nGastrointestinal tract discomfort may produce nausea and vomiting. In an\r\noccupational setting however, ingestion of insignificant quantities is not\r\nthought to be cause for concern.</span></p> <p>The very bitter taste is likely to give early warning of accidental ingestion. Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure. Cloudy swelling, patchy necrosis and fatty infiltration in such visceral organs as the heart, liver and kidneys shows at death.</p> <p>\u00a0Rats fed repeatedly on a similar material (a C12-C16 alkyl derivative), over several weeks, died of inanition associated with chronic diarrhoea; at autopsy the only lesion found was focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the gastric mucosa.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism.

These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma.

Therefore, read-across  of exposure-related observations in humans from CAS 683-10-3 is  justified. Data from several human closed patch tests demonstrate skin  irritation in humans ranging from mild to strong under occlusive  conditions even with concentrations as low as 1%. In contrast, exposure  to 0.1% under open conditions did not induce any positive skin  reactions. <br />Information on skin sensitisation in humans is available  from a closed human patch test with CAS 683-10-3. After an induction  period of 6 days with 0.1% of active ingredient, followed by a  treatment-free period of 10 days, the volunteers were challenged under  occlusive conditions for 24 hours. No reactions were observed  immediately after challenge; during the next 4 days only irritation  reactions were observed. <br />This finding was further supported by  industrial medical monitoring data.\u00a0 Workers involved in the production  of CAS 683-10-3 are routinely checked every 3 years for signs of skin  sensitisation, respiratory irritation, skin irritation and eye  irritation. During these examinations no signs of the aforementioned  disorders were observed which were related to the test substance. <br />Moreover,  a study focusing on dermal uptake of C12-alkyldimethyl betaine) into  human skin and the effects of surfactants on skin barrier function  demonstrated that only up to 0.4% of the applied dose was absorbed  within 30 minutes of exposure, with absorbance being dependent on the  concentration applied. Tape stripping of the skin revealed that the  administered test substance was primarily located in the outer stratum  corneum layer<br />Test material does not demonstrate mutagenic or clastogenic effects in bacteria or mammalian cells in vitro<br />\" REACH Dossier<br />Amphoteric  surfactants are easily absorbed in the intestine and are excreted  partly unchanged via the faeces. Metabolisation to CO2 and short-chained  fatty acids also occur. No tendency to accumulation in the organism or  storage of betaines in certain organs has been detected. Betaines  generally have a low acute toxicity. E.g., LD50 values for  cocoamidopropylbetaine (30% solution) by oral administration have been  determined to 4,910 mg/kg body weight in rats.<br />Betaines do not carry  any net charge, and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds  with proteins in the skin. This may be the explanation for the low  protein denaturation potential of betaines as the ion-binding of other  surfactants contributes to denaturation. In combination with anionic  surfactants a positive synergistic effect with regard to skin  compatibility is often found. Compared to a 20% solution of C12 alkyl  sulfate (AS; sodium lauryl sulfate) alone, decreased erythema was  observed for the combination of 20% C12 AS and 10% cocoamidopropyl  betaine one hour after the removal of patches. The combination of  cocoamidopropyl betaine and C12 AS also reduced swelling of the skin,  and generally interactions between amphoterics and AS produce less  swelling and result in milder skin reactions. Concentrated betaines are  expected to be irritant to skin and eyes. Diluted solutions (3-10%) are  not irritant to skin, but they are mildly irritant to the eyes (4.5%)<br />No  evidence of delayed contact hypersensitivity was found in guinea pigs  after topically administrated solutions of 10% cocoamidopropyl betaine  by using the Magnusson-Kligman maximization test. Various instances of  contact allergy to cocoamidopropyl betaine have been reported. In all of  the reports it was concluded that the observed skin reactions were due  to the presence of 3-dimethylaminopropylamine which is an impurity in  cocoamidopropyl betaine. This impurity is an intermediate in the  synthesis of alkylamidopropyldimethylamines that are intermediates in  the synthesis of the corresponding alkylamido betaines.<br />Cocoamidopropyl  betaine was proven to be non-mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the  Ames Salmonella/microsome reverse mutation assay. Short-term  genotoxicity tests have shown negative results of mutagenicity for  lauryl betaine in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness.

Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis of epidemiological data, the material is regarded as carcinogenic to humans. There is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>When administered by inhalation, formaldehyde induced squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal cavity in rats of both sexes. Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p>",
