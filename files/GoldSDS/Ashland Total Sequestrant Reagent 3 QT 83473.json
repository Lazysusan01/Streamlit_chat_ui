Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce severely toxic effects. Relatively small amounts absorbed from the lungs may prove fatal.</p> <p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Inhalation of nitric acid mist or fumes at 2 to 25 ppm over an 8 hour period may cause pulmonary irritation and symptoms of lung damage. Only several minutes of exposure to concentrated atmosphere i.e. 200 ppm may cause severe pulmonary damage and even fatality. Death may be delayed for several days.</p> <p>Exposure to nitric acid fumes (with concurrent inhalation of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide) may elicit prompt irritation of the upper respiratory tract leading to coughing, gagging, chest pain, dyspnea, cyanosis if concentrations are sufficiently high and duration of exposure sufficiently long, pulmonary oedema.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Irritation of the eyes may produce a heavy secretion of tears (lachrymation).</p> <p>Eye contact with concentrated nitric acid may give no pain, whilst diluted solution causes intense pain and both can cause permanent eye damage or blindness. Burns may result in shrinkage of the eyeball, symblepharon (adhesions between tarsal and bulbar conjunctivae), permanent corneal opacification, and visual impairment leading to blindness</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to produce harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives using animal models). Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Reactions may not occur on exposure but response may be delayed with symptoms only appearing many hours later</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Skin contact with nitric acid causes yellow discolouration of the skin, blisters and scars that may not heal. The skin may be stained bright-yellow or yellowish brown due to the formation of xanthoproteic acid. Dilute solutions may harden the epithelium without producing overt corrosion.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>The material is not thought to produce adverse health effects following ingestion (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Nevertheless, adverse systemic effects have been produced following exposure of animals by at least one other route and good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum.</p> <p>Even a small amount of nitric acid causes severe corrosion of the stomach, burning pain, vomiting and shock, possibly causing non-healing scarring of the gastrointestinal tract and stomach. Death may be delayed 12 hours to 14 days or to several months. Such late fatalities are attributed to a chemical lobular pneumonitis secondary to aspiration. Survivors show stricture of the gastric mucosa and subsequent pernicious anaemia.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Repeated or long-term occupational exposure is likely to produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <html><head><title></title> </head> <body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" leftmargin=5 topmargin=5 rightmargin=5 bottommargin=5> <font size=2 color=\"#000000\" face=\"Arial\"> <div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div> <div><font color=\"#000000\">Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed.</font></div> </font> </body></html> <p>Serious damage (clear functional disturbance or morphological change which may have toxicological significance) is likely to be caused by repeated or prolonged exposure.
