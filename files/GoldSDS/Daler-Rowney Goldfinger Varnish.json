The two isomeric forms are shown above. The di- and tripropylene glycol ethers may form up to 4 and 8 isomeric forms, respectively. Even so, all isomers exhibit either the \"alpha\" or \"beta\" configuration, existing as secondary or primary alcohols, respectively. The distribution of isomeric forms for the di- and tripropylene glycols, as with the mono-PGEs, also results in predominantly the alpha form (i.e., a secondary alcohol). It should be noted that only the alpha isomer and isomeric mixtures (consisting predominantly of the alpha isomer) are produced commercially; the purified beta isomer is not produced at this time.</p>",

Investigation of the hazards associated with use of 2-butoxyethanol for alloy electropolishing showed that mixtures with 50-95% of acid at 20 deg C, or 40-90% at 75 C, were explosive and initiable by sparks.

                "Environment": "<p>for propylene glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Most are liquids at room temperature and all are water-soluble.</p> <p>Typical propylene glycol ethers include propylene glycol n-butyl ether (PnB); dipropylene glycol n-butyl ether (DPnB); dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate (DPMA); tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TPM)</p> <p>Environmental fate: Log octanol-water partition coefficients (log Kow's) range from 0.309 for TPM to 1.523 for DPnB. Calculated BCFs range from 1.47 for DPnB to 3.16 for DPMA and TPM, indicating low bioaccumulation. Henry's Law Constants, which indicate propensity to partition from water to air, are low for all category members, ranging from 5.7 x 10-9 atm-m3/mole for TPM to 2.7 x10-9 atm-m3/mole for PnB. Fugacity modeling indicates that most propylene glycol ethers are likely to partition roughly equally into the soil and water compartments in the environment with small to negligible amounts remaining in other environmental compartments (air, sediment, and aquatic biota). Propylene glycol ethers are unlikely to persist in the environment. Once in air, the half-life of the category members due to direct reactions with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals, range from 2.0 hours for TPM to 4.6 hours for PnB. In water, most \u00a0members of this family \u00a0are \"readily biodegradable\" under aerobic conditions. (DPMA degraded within 28 days (and within the specified 10-day window) but only using pre-adapted or \"acclimated\" inoculum.). In soil, biodegradation is rapid for PM and PMA.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute aquatic toxicity testing indicates low toxicity for both ethers and acetates. For ethers, effect concentrations are &gt; 500 mg/L. For acetates, effect concentrations are &gt; 151 mg/L.</p> <p>For glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Ether groups are generally stable to hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. OECD guideline studies indicate ready biodegradability for several glycol ethers although higher molecular weight species seem to biodegrade at a slower rate. No glycol ethers that have been tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes. Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr). When released to water, glycol ethers undergo biodegradation (typically 47-92% after 8-21 days) and have a low potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow ranges from -1.73 to +0.51).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic toxicity data indicate that the tri- and tetra ethylene glycol ethers are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers.</p> <p>Glycols exert a high oxygen demand for decomposition and once released to the environments cause the death of aquatic organisms if dissolved oxygen is depleted.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for propylene glycol <u>monomethyl</u>\r\nether (PGME)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Odour Threshold: 10 ppm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The TLV-TWA is protective against\r\ndiscomfort caused by odour, against eye and skin irritation, and chronic\r\neffects (including possible liver and kidney damage).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Individuals exposed to 100 ppm\r\nreported a transient unpleasant odour with slight eye irritation after about 1 or\r\n2 hours.

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Repeated oral doses of 3 g/kg for\r\npropylene glycol <u>monomethyl</u> ether (PGME) produced minor changes in the\r\nliver and kidneys in rats. Repeated doses on the skin over a 90-day period\r\nresulted in absorption and anaesthetic death at 7-10 ml/kg/day. Mild narcosis\r\nwas observed after topical application of 2-4 ml/kg/day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Administration of 2% PGME in\r\ndrinking water ad libitum to males for 25 days did not elicit significant\r\nchanges in testes or seminal vesicle and coagulating gland weights or in\r\nperipheral leukocyte counts. No significant testicular toxicity was found in\r\nrats or rabbits that were exposed at up to 3000 PGME, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week\r\nfor 13 weeks. Oral and parenteral administration to pregnant rabbits, mice and\r\nrats did not induce congenital malformations at concentrations up to 1800\r\nmg/kg/day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In a study on the teratogenic\r\npotential of the acetate of the beta-isomer (2-methoxy-1-propyl acetate), a significant\r\nincrease in the number of litters with abnormal rats and rabbits was found\r\nafter inhalation exposure by the mothers to 2700 ppm or 550 ppm, respectively,\r\non days 6 to 15, or 6 to 18 of gestation. The rabbit inhalation\r\nno-observed-adverse effect concentration was 145 ppm. A similar embryotoxicity\r\nprofile was seen after inhalation of 2-methoxy-1-propanol (beta-PGMA). In\r\ncontrast to the alpha-isomer, beta-PGMA is oxidised in rats to\r\n2-methoxypropionic acid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Male dogs exposed to the\r\nbeta-isomer, developed numerous spermiophages in epididymi. Administration of\r\nhigh doses of the beta-isomer to rats, by gavage, caused delayed ossification\r\nof the skull of rat foetus.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Whilst alpha-PGMA undergoes\r\nhepatic O-demethylation as the principal pathway, the beta-isomer is detoxified\r\nby alcohol/ aldehyde dehydrogenase. Commercial PGME contains low concentrations\r\nof the beta-isomer.</span></p>",
