More specifically,\r\nbisphenol A closely mimics the structure and function of the hormone oestradiol\r\nwith the ability to bind to and activate the same oestrogen receptor as the\r\nnatural hormone.

Several mechanisms\r\ncan help explain the effect of BPA on body weight increase.\u00a0 A possible\u00a0 mechanism\r\nleading to triglyceride accumulation is the decreased production of the hormone\r\nadiponectin from all human adipose tissue tested when exposed to very low\r\nlevels (below nanomolar range) of BPA in cell or explant culture settings . The\r\nexpression of leptin as well as several enzymes and transcription factors is\r\nalso affected by BPA exposure in vivo as well as in vitro. Together, the\r\naltered expression and activity of these important mediators of fat metabolism\r\ncould explain the increase in weight following BPA exposure in rodent models.\r\nThese results also suggest that, together with other obesogens, low,\r\nenvironmentally relevant levels of BPA may contribute to the human obesity\r\nphenomenon.</span></p> <p>All multifunctional acrylates (MFA) produce skin discomfort and are known or suspected skin sensitisers. Aerosols generated in the industrial process are reported to produce dermatitis - vapours generated by the heat of milling may also occur in sufficient concentration to produce dermatitis. Because exposure to industrial aerosols of MFA may also include exposure to various resin systems, photo-initiators, solvents, hydrogen-transfer agents, stabilisers, surfactants, fillers and polymerisation inhibitors, toxic effects may arise due to a range of chemical actions.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Whether the substance is irritating at or around the reported odour threshold is inconclusive. Subchronic oral studies indicate no effect on growth or haematology at doses of up to 10000 ppm in the diet. The TLV-TWA is thought to be protective against the potential irritant or odour effects of acetophenone.</p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin. Absorption by skin may readily exceed vapour inhalation exposure. Symptoms for skin absorption are the same as for inhalation.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Acrylic acid and methyl\r\nacrylate showed limited biodegradability in the five day biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand (BOD5) test, while ethyl acrylate and butyl acrylate were degraded\r\neasily (77% and 56%, respectively). Using the OECD method 301D 28-d closed\r\nbottle test, degradability for acrylic acid was 81% at 28 days, while the\r\nacrylic esters ranged from 57% to 60%.

The acute toxicity of the acrylic\r\nesters was \u2018moderately' toxic. Effects on algae of these compounds could not be\r\njudged from static tests due to the extensive biodegradation and volatilisation\r\nthat occurred during the tests. \u00a0Toxicity tests were conducted using freshwater\r\nand marine fish, invertebrates, and algae. Acrylic acid effect concentrations\r\nfor fish and invertebrates ranged from 27 to 236 mg/l. Effect concentrations\r\n(LC50 or EC50) for fish and invertebrates using methyl acrylate, ethyl\r\nacrylate, and butyl acrylate ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 mg/l. The chronic maximum\r\nacceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for acrylic acid with\u00a0<i>Daphnia\r\nmagna</i>\u00a0was 27 mg/l based on length and young produced per adult\r\nreproduction day and for ethyl acrylate was 0.29 mg/l based on both the\r\nreproductive and growth endpoints.

Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>The synthetic, amorphous silicas are believed to represent a very greatly reduced silicosis hazard compared to crystalline silicas and are considered to be nuisance dusts.</p> <p>When heated to high temperature and a long time, amorphous silica can produce crystalline silica on cooling. Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

These chemicals have low vapor pressures\r\nand are miscible in water. Therefore, volatilisation is not expected to be an\r\nimportant removal process. Studies indicate that volatilisation of these\r\nchemicals from water increases with higher concentrations of the chemical and\r\nin the presence of sunlight (due to increased temperature of the hydrazine\r\npool). Hydrazine and dimethylhydrazines degrade rapidly in air through\r\nreactions with ozone, hydroxyl (OH) radicals, and nitrogen dioxide. The\r\nreaction of hydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine with ozone is probably the\r\nmajor fate of these chemicals in the atmosphere</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrazine\r\nundergoes complex interactions with soils, including both reversible\r\nphysical-sorption and irreversible chemisorption to colloids. In a study on the\r\nadsorption and leaching characteristics of hydrazine fuels, no adsorption of\r\n1,1-dimethylhydrazine was observed on sand, with almost 100% of the chemical\r\nleaching with water. In three other soils,adsorption ranged from 26% to 80%. No\r\ncorrelation between adsorption and soil organic content or pH was observed.\r\nHydrazine adsorption studies with clays and soils indicate that adsorption may\r\nbe correlated with soil organic matter and clay content and is highly dependent\r\non pH; hydrazine appears to be adsorbed by different mechanisms under acidic\r\nand alkaline conditions. Autooxidation appears to be the major factor\r\ncontributing to disappearance of the chemical, but the study authors attributed\r\nabout 20% of removal to biodegradation. Several heterotrophic soil bacteria were\r\nreported to degrade hydrazine, indicating that microbial degradation may\r\ncontribute to removal of the chemical from soil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine degrade in aqueous systems,\r\nbut the rate of degradation is dependent on specific aquatic environmental\r\nfactors, including pH, hardness, temperature, oxygen concentration, and the\r\npresence of organic matter and metal ions. \u00a0Oxidation and biodegradation\r\nare the primary removal mechanisms. Reaction of hydrazine with dissolved oxygen\r\nis catalyzed by metal ions, particularly copper. The reaction rate is strongly\r\ninfluenced by pH; degradation proceeds more rapidly in alkaline solutions.\r\nHydrazine is rapidly removed from polluted waters, with less than one-third of\r\nthe original concentration remaining in dirty river water after 2 hours.\r\nHowever, chlorinated, filtered, and softened city water contained almost the\r\noriginal amount of hydrazine after 4 days.

Levels exceeding 70% may be fatal.\u00a0</p> <p>Experience of the effects of phenylhydrazine in man has been obtained from the use of the hydrochloride in the treatment of polycythemia vera (an overabundance of blood cell elements). Undesirable side-effects include jaundice, anorexia, nausea, dermatitis and vascular thromboses</p> <p>Hydrazine (and some of its derivatives), is a strong convulsant in laboratory animals and can cause central nervous system (CNS) depression or stimulation. Symptoms of CNS depression may include nonspecific discomfort, \u00a0giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal. CNS stimulation may produce dyspnea, coughing, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm. Muscular involvement may produce symptoms ranging from fasciculation to spasticity or seizures. Headache, dizziness and confusion may also result as can hyperpyrexia or a sensation of warmth. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and difficulty in urination. \u00a0Cardiovascular involvement may produce alterations in blood pressure or arrhythmia.</p> <p>Pulmonary oedema and cardiovascular collapse also seem to be a feature of acute hydrazine poisonings. Animals that survive for more than a day frequently develop liver necrosis and renal failure. As judged by a few severe poisonings, man reacts like monkey in the sense that liver injury is more severe than kidney failure. Severe hypoglycaemia may develop even earlier than liver necrosis although this is rarely mentioned in the literature.</p> <p>Hydrazine and some of its derivatives produces local irritation, convulsions, hepatotoxicity and haemolysis. Absorption occurs through all routes of administration.</p> <p>Liver damage is generally the most important feature of chronic hydrazine overexposure. The characteristic liver pathology encountered with the hydrazines is fatty degeneration in the centre of the liver lobules and hepatocellular damage.</p> <p>There may also be kidney damage consisting of nephritis and acute tubular necrosis.</p> <p>Other symptoms of chronic exposure to the hydrazines include lethargy, conjunctivitis, tremor, pyrexia, vomiting and diarrhoea</p> <p>Some hydrazine derivatives induce central nervous system (CNS) excitability, tremors and convulsion progressing to CNS depression and possible fatal respiratory system collapse.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Hydrazine allergy has been reported.</p>",

Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>When administered orally, hydrazine induced pulmonary adenomas and adenocarcinomas in mice. Inhalation induced lung carcinomas and lymphosarcomas of the spleen in female mice. A study of 423 men, involved in the manufacture of hydrazine revealed three stomach, one prostate and a neurogenic cancer.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to phenylhydrazine can cause damage to the liver, lungs and kidneys.</p> <p>Rats receiving 0.25 to 0.5 mg phenylhydrazine/animal/day,, 5 days/week for 40 weeks by gavage exhibited haemolytic anaemia. Mice given 1 mg phenylhydrazine orally/mouse/day, 7 days/week for 42 weeks showed an increase incidence of total and malignant lung tumours. Another study with the hydrochloride in drinking water (average 0.63 to 0.81 mg/day) over their lifetime showed an increase in blood vessel tumours. When phenylhydrazine was given orally to mice (5 days/week for 40 weeks 0.25 mg-0.5 mg) no significant carcinogenic response was seen. The mechanism of carcinogenic activity displayed by hydrazine may include indirect alkylation of DNA which is closely related to the toxic endpoint.</p> <p>Phenylhydrazines are capable of exerting haemolytic effects following a haemoglobin-catalysed metabolic conversion. This haemolytic effect is a consequence of the formation of free radicals in which phenylhydrazine undergoes oxidation to a phenyl diazinyl radical intermediate and subsequent conversion to a phenyl radical (and nitrogen, N2).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Oxygen activation (generation of a superoxide) occurs during one\r\nof the reactions of this metabolic sequence.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience).

Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia.

These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Although,BIT has been shown to be hydrolytically stable with a half life of &gt; 30 days, it breaks down fairly quickly in aerobic soils. BIT shows moderate to strong binding to soils, with adsorption Kd values estimated to be between 1.24 and 9.56 \u00a0However, it breaks down aerobically on the surface soils. Since it has a moderate binding potential to soils, it is not likely to migrate into the ground and there is low potential for ground water contamination. Furthermore, with a Kow \u00a0value of 20 at 25 deg C, BIT is unlikely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Based on acute toxicity information, 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one displays low to moderate toxicity to birds and mammals.

Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Solutions of 0.5% strength 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one (BIT) are irritating to the skin. Allergenic effects also begin at 0.05% and have been confirmed in a series of case and patch test studies. When the substance was applied to human volunteers under an occlusive patch the maximum tolerated doses was 0.05%. Five hours after application of 0.1% (1000 ppm) one person showed moderate erythema with papule development which was interpreted as a reaction to the sticking plaster; in four persons there was mild reddening of the skin. The reaction had ameliorated in several persons after 72 hours. A second application produced various severe dermal reactions (erythema and papules) in 8 persons. A third application to several of the group produced erythema.</p> <p>Provocation tests with BIT showed the material to be sensitising. Of 20 metal workers with dermatitis, 4 were shown to have been sensitised to BIT in cutting oils. Cases of contact eczema in workers producing polyacrylate emulsions for paints and wax polish, in which BIT was the preservative, have been described. Epicutaneous challenge tests to BIT were positive. Similar findings have been described in the paper-manufacturing industry, in the rubber industry, in the control laboratory of a chemical plant and among workers producing ceramic moulds in which BIT was added to the mould oil</p> <p>Aqueous solutions of isothiazolinones may be irritating or even corrosive depending on concentration.

Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p>In a teratogenic study in rats concentrations of up to 40 mg/kg 1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one (BIT) were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. The material is not mutagenic. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study with rats, BIT did not produce excess tumours. The results derived from this test are questionable because no dose series was administered and because there were too few animals.</p> <p>A 90-day study with beagle dogs receiving oral doses showed reduced food consumption and body weight gain as well as mild anaemia, increases in the weights of liver and in male animals, brain and spleen weights.</p> <p>The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) was given as 165 mg/kg (ie 0.5 BIT in the diet).

In a multigeneration study using rats dietary saccharin induced transitional cell carcinomas and papillomas of the urinary bladder in the first generation male off-spring. Surgical insertion of pellets containing saccharin resulted in urinary bladder cancer in mice and urinary bladder carcinomas in female mice.</p> <p>Transplacental exposure of rats to sodium saccharin and saccharin did not produce treatment-related neoplasms. Pretreatment with a single instillation in the urinary bladder of a low dose of N-methyl-N-</p> <p>nitrosourea or feeding of N-(4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazoyl)formamide followed by oral administration of sodium saccharin increased the incidence of urinary bladder neoplasms in rats. Simultaneous administration of N-nitroso-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)butylamine and sodium saccharin produced significant increases in urinary bladder papillomas.</p> <p>The results of many case-control studies with humans have proved to be largely inconsistent. One large study showed a significant trend of increasing risk with increasing daily consumption in female non-smokers and male heavy smokers. Subsequent analysis of the data confirmed the original findings overall but cast doubt on the significance of the findings in the two subgroups because of inconsistent dose-response trends.</p> <p><font color=\"#292526\">The isothiazolinones are known contact sensitisers.
