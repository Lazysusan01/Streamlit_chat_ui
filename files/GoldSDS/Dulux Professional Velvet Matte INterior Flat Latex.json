The Henry's law constant for ethylene glycol is 1.41 \u00d7 10-3 or 6.08 \u00d7 10-3 Pa.m3/mol, depending on method of calculation, indicating a low capacity for volatilisation from water bodies or soil surfaces.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol adsorbed onto silica gel and irradiated with light (wavelength &gt;290 nm) degraded by 12.1% over 17 h . Photodegradation is not expected, as the molecule should not absorb at these wavelengths; the mechanism of this breakdown is, therefore, unknown. Estimated half-life in the atmosphere for reaction with hydroxyl radicals from various reports \u00a0is 2.1 days , 8-84 h \u00a0or 1 day.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol released to the atmosphere will be degraded by reaction with hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for the compound in this reaction has been estimated at between 0.3 and 3.5 days. No hydrolysis of ethylene glycol is expected in surface waters.</p>\n<p>The compound has little or no capacity to bind to particulates and will be mobile in soil. Soil partition coefficients (log Koc) of 0-0.62 were determined. Migration rates in five soil types were measured \u00a0at between 4 and 27 cm per 12 h</p>\n<p>The low octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow -1.93 to -1.36)and measured bioconcentration factors in a few organisms indicate low capacity for bioaccumulation. Bioconcentration factors of 190 for the green algae\u00a0(Chlorella fusca)\u00a0, up to 0.27 in specific tissues of the crayfish (\u00a0Procambarus\u00a0sp.) , and 10 for the golden orfe\u00a0(Leuciscus idus melanotus)\u00a0confirm low bioaccumulation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Ethylene glycol is readily biodegradable in standard tests using sewage sludge. Many studies show biodegradation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Some studies suggest a lag phase before degradation, but many do not. Degradation occurs in both adapted and unadapted sludges. Rapid degradation has been reported in surface waters (less in salt water than in fresh water), groundwater, and soil inocula. Several strains of microorganisms capable of utilising ethylene glycol as a carbon source have been identified.</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol has been identified as a metabolite of the growth regulator ethylene in a number of higher plants and as naturally occurring in the edible fungus\u00a0Tricholoma matsutake</p>\n<p><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong></p>\n<p>Fish LC50 (96 h):118-550 mg/L</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol has generally low toxicity to aquatic organisms. Toxic thresholds for microorganisms are above 1000 mg/litre. EC50s for growth in microalgae are 6500 mg/litre or higher. Acute toxicity tests with aquatic invertebrates where a value could be determined show LC50s above 20 000 mg/litre, and those with fish show LC50s above 17 800 mg/litre. An amphibian test showed an LC50 for tadpoles at 17 000 mg/litre. A no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for chronic tests on daphnids of 8590 mg/litre (for reproductive end-points) has been reported. A NOEC following short-term exposure of fish has been reported at 15 380 mg/litre for growth. Tests using deicer containing ethylene glycol showed greater toxicity to aquatic organisms than observed with the pure compound, indicating other toxic components of the formulations. Laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have demonstrated toxic effects and death. Field studies in the vicinity of an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity. These effects cannot definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol. Terrestrial organisms are much less likely to be exposed to ethylene glycol and generally show low sensitivity to the compound. Concentrations above 100 000 mg/litre were needed to produce toxic effects on yeasts and fungi from soil. Very high concentrations and soaking of seeds produced inhibition of germination in some experiments; these are not considered of environmental significance. A no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for orally dosed ducks at 1221 mg/kg body weight and reported lethal doses for poultry at around 8000 mg/kg body weight indicate low toxicity to birds.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce severe damage to the health of the individual. Relatively small amounts absorbed through the lungs may prove fatal.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Strong evidence exists that exposure to the material may produce very serious irreversible damage (other than carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and teratogenesis) following a single exposure by swallowing.</p> <p>The toxic effects of glycols (dihydric alcohols), following ingestion are similar to those of alcohol, with depression of the central nervous system (CNS), nausea, vomiting and degenerative changes in liver and kidney.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>for ethylene glycol:</p> <p>Ingestion symptoms include respiratory failure, central nervous depression, cardiovascular collapse, pulmonary oedema, acute kidney failure, and even brain damage. Ingestion of 100 ml has caused death. (ChemInfo)</p> <p>Toxicity of ethylene glycol to human (KB) cell cultures has been reported as less than that of ethanol. (NIOSHTIC)</p> <p>Ethylene glycol produces a three-stage response with the severity of each stage dependent on the amount of ingestion. Hepatic damage is usually minimal. Central nervous system depression characterise the first 12 hours post ingestion.</p> <p>Transient exhilaration occurs without the odour of ethanol.</p> <p>Gastrointestinal complaints include nausea and vomiting. Acidosis, coma, convulsions and myoclonic jerks may also be evident. The optic fundus is usually normal although the presence of papilloedema may confuse the presentation with that produced by methanol. Nystagmus and opthalmoplegias may appear.</p> <p>Cardiopulmonary effects are seen 12-24 hours post-ingestion and are characterised by tachycardia, tachypnea, and mild hypertension. Congestive heart failure and circulatory collapse may occur in severe intoxications.</p> <p>Renal effects are seen 24-72 hours post-ingestion and are characterised by oliguria, flank pain, acute tubular necrosis, renal failure, and rarely, bone marrow arrest. Renal damage may be permanent.</p> <p>Toxic effects of ethylene glycol are similar to those produced by ethanol but ethylene glycol produces toxic metabolites. Metabolic acidosis and anion gap result primarily from glycolic acid formation and some lactic</p> <p>acid formation. The citric acid cycle is inhibited as a result of reduced NAD/NADH ratios and to a limited extent, the formation of oxalic acid, and to metabolic acidosis. Oxalate formation produces myocardial depression and acute tubular necrosis. Glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid may contribute to CNS depression and may also produce renal toxicity by producing renal oedema. Hypocalcaemia may result from chelation by oxalate. Oxalic acid, glycoxalic acid, glycoaldehyde and formic acid appear to form to only a limited degree during intoxication.</p> <p>Oral administration to pregnant mice and rats produced birth defects amongst the off-spring.</p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>There is some evidence to provide a presumption that human exposure to the material may result in impaired fertility on the basis of: \u00a0some evidence in animal studies of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which is not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Human volunteers exposed to ethylene glycol, 20 to 22 hours/day at mean daily concentrations ranging form 1.4 to 27 ppm for about 4 weeks complained of throat irritation, mild headache and low backache. Complaints became marked when the concentration in the exposure chamber was raised above 56 mg/m3 for part of the day. The most common complaint was irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Concentrations above 80 ppm were intolerable with a burning sensation along the trachea and a burning cough. Excessively exposed workers have reported drowsiness.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>The concentration of dust, for application of respirable dust limits, is to be determined from the fraction that penetrates a separator whose size collection efficiency is described by a cumulative log-normal function with a median aerodynamic diameter of 4.0 um (+-) 0.3 um and with a geometric standard deviation of 1.5 um (+-) 0.1 um, i.e..generally less than 5 um.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>|Chronic symptoms include decreased vital lung capacity and chest infections.",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine).

A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

It differs greatly from classical silicosis both clinically and pathologically. The disease is rapidly progressive with diffuse pulmonary involvement developing only months after the initial exposure and causing deaths within 1 to 2 years. It is often complicated by an associated tuberculosis. The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage. This causes the macrophage to be digested by its own enzymes and after lysis the free silica is released to be ingested by other macrophages thus continuing initiate collagen formation in the lung tissue producing the characteristic nodule found in classical (chronic) silicosis.</p>",

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure. Chronic inhalation in rats by single or\r\nrepeated intratracheal instillation produced a significant increase in the\r\nincidences of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\r\nLifetime inhalation of crystalline silica (87% alpha-quartz) at 1 mg/m3 (74%\r\nrespirable) by rats, produced an increase in animals with keratinising cystic\r\nsquamous cell tumours, adenomas, adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous cell\r\ncarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma and nodular bronchiolar alveolar\r\nhyperplasia accompanied by extensive subpleural and peribronchiolar fibrosis,\r\nincreased pulmonary collagen content, focal lipoproteinosis and macrophage\r\ninfiltration. Thoracic and abdominal malignant lymphomas developed in rats\r\nafter single intrapleural and intraperitoneal injection of suspensions of\r\nseveral types of quartz.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Some studies show excess numbers\r\nof cases of schleroderma, connective tissue disorders, lupus, rheumatoid\r\narthritis chronic kidney diseases, and end-stage kidney disease in workers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>NOTE</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>: Some\r\njurisdictions require health surveillance be conducted on workers occupationally\r\nexposed to silica, crystalline.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated\r\nby plants and animals.Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or\r\notherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental\r\nfate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminium\r\noccurs in the environment in the form of silicates, oxides and hydroxides,\r\ncombined with other elements such as sodium, fluorine and arsenic complexes\r\nwith organic matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acidification\r\nof soils releases aluminium as a transportable solution. Mobilisation of\r\naluminium by acid rain results in aluminium becoming available for plant\r\nuptake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As an\r\nelement, aluminum cannot be degraded in the environment, but may undergo\r\nvarious precipitation or ligand exchange reactions. Aluminum in compounds has\r\nonly one oxidation state (+3), and would not undergo oxidation-reduction\r\nreactions under environmental conditions. Aluminum can be complexed by various\r\nligands present in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids). The\r\nsolubility of aluminum in the environment will depend on the ligands present\r\nand the pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ntrivalent aluminum ion is surrounded by six water molecules in solution. The\r\nhydrated aluminum ion, [Al(H2O)6]3+, undergoes hydrolysis, in which a stepwise\r\ndeprotonation of the coordinated water ligands forms bound hydroxide ligands\r\n(e.g., [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+, [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+). The speciation of aluminum in water\r\nis pH dependent. The hydrated trivalent aluminum ion is the predominant form at\r\npH levels below 4. Between pH 5 and 6, the predominant hydrolysis products are\r\nAl(OH)2+ and Al(OH)2+, while the solid Al(OH)3 is most prevalent between pH 5.2\r\nand 8.8. The soluble species Al(OH)4- is the predominant species above pH 9,\r\nand is the only species present above pH 10. Polymeric aluminum hydroxides\r\nappear between pH 4.7 and 10.5, and increase in size until they are transformed\r\ninto colloidal particles of amorphous Al(OH)3, which crystallise to gibbsite in\r\nacid waters. Polymerisation is affected by the presence of dissolved silica;\r\nwhen enough silica is present, aluminum is precipitated as poorly crystallised\r\nclay mineral species.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyaluminum\r\ncompounds are considered amphoteric (e.g., they can act as both acids and bases\r\nin solution). Because of this property, aluminum hydroxides can act as buffers\r\nand resist pH changes within the narrow pH range of 4-5.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monomeric\r\naluminum compounds, typified by aluminum fluoride, chloride, and sulfate, are\r\nconsidered reactive or labile compounds, whereas polymeric aluminum species\r\nreact much more slowly in the environment. Aluminum has a stronger attraction\r\nfor fluoride in an acidic environment compared to other inorganic ligand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nadsorption of aluminum onto clay surfaces can be a significant factor in\r\ncontrolling aluminum mobility in the environment, and these adsorption\r\nreactions, measured in one study at pH 3.0-4.1, have been observed to be very\r\nrapid. However, clays may act either as a sink or a source for soluble aluminum\r\ndepending on the degree of aluminum saturation on the clay surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Within\r\nthe pH range of 5-6, aluminum complexes with phosphate and is removed from\r\nsolution. Because phosphate is a necessary nutrient in ecological systems, this\r\nimmobilization of both aluminum and phosphate may result in depleted nutrient\r\nstates in surface water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant\r\nspecies and cultivars of the same species differ considerably in their ability\r\nto take up and translocate aluminum to above-ground parts. Tea leaves may\r\ncontain very high concentrations of aluminum, &gt;5,000 mg/kg in old leaves.\r\nOther plants that may contain high levels of aluminum include Lycopodium\r\n(Lycopodiaceae), a few ferns, Symplocos (Symplocaceae), and Orites\r\n(Proteaceae). Aluminum is often taken up and concentrated in root tissue. In\r\nsub-alpine ecosystems, the large root biomass of the Douglas fir, <i>Abies\r\namabilis</i>, takes up aluminum and immobilizes it, preventing large\r\naccumulation in above-ground tissue. It is unclear to what extent aluminum is\r\ntaken up into root food crops and leafy vegetables. An uptake factor\r\n(concentration of aluminum in the plant/concentration of aluminum in soil) of\r\n0.004 for leafy vegetables and 0.00065 for fruits and tubers has been reported,\r\nbut the pH and plant species from which these uptake factors were derived are\r\nunclear. Based upon these values, however, it is clear that aluminum is not\r\ntaken up in plants from soil, but is instead biodiluted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminum\r\nconcentrations in rainbow trout from an alum-treated lake, an untreated lake,\r\nand a hatchery were highest in gill tissue and lowest in muscle. Aluminum\r\nresidue analyses in brook trout have shown that whole-body aluminum content\r\ndecreases as the fish advance from larvae to juveniles. These results imply\r\nthat the aging larvae begin to decrease their rate of aluminum uptake, to\r\neliminate aluminum at a rate that exceeds uptake, or to maintain approximately\r\nthe same amount of aluminum while the body mass increases. The decline in\r\nwhole-body aluminum residues in juvenile brook trout may be related to growth\r\nand dilution by edible muscle tissue that accumulated less aluminum than did\r\nthe other tissues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ngreatest fraction of the gill-associated aluminum was not sorbed to the gill\r\ntissue, but to the gill mucus. It is thought that mucus appears to retard\r\naluminum transport from solution to the membrane surface, thus delaying the\r\nacute biological response of the fish. It has been reported that concentrations\r\nof aluminum in whole-body tissue of the Atlantic salmon exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of aluminum ranging from 3 ug/g (for fish exposed to 33 ug/L) to\r\n96 ug/g (for fish exposed to 264 ug/L) at pH 5.5. After 60 days of exposure,\r\nBCFs ranged from 76 to 190 and were directly related to the aluminum exposure\r\nconcentration. In acidic waters (pH 4.6-5.3) with low concentrations of calcium\r\n(0.5-1.5 mg Ca/L), labile aluminum between 25 and 75 ug/L is toxic. Because\r\naluminum is toxic to many aquatic species, it is not bioaccumulated to a\r\nsignificant degree (BCF &lt;300) in most fish and shellfish; therefore,\r\nconsumption of contaminated fish does not appear to be a significant source of\r\naluminum exposure in humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioconcentration\r\nof aluminum has also been reported for several aquatic invertebrate species.\r\nBCF values ranging from 0.13 to 0.5 in the whole-body were reported for the\r\nsnail. Bioconcentration of aluminum has also been reported for aquatic insects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"color:black\">Freshwater\r\nspecies pH &gt;6.5</span></i></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish:\r\nAcute LC50 (48-96 h) 5 spp: 0.6 (<i>Salmo salar) - </i>106 mg/L; Chronic NOEC\r\n(8-28 d): 7 spp,NOEC, 0.034-7.1 mg/L.

Fish are generally more sensitive to aluminium than\r\naquatic invertebrates. Aluminium is a gill toxicant to fish, causing both\r\nionoregulatory and respiratory effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nbioavailability and toxicity of aluminium is generally greatest in acid\r\nsolutions. Aluminium in acid habitats has been observed to be toxic to fish and\r\nphytoplankton. Aluminium is generally more toxic over the pH range 4.4.5.4,\r\nwith a maximum toxicity occurring around pH 5.0.5.2. The inorganic single unit\r\naluminium species (Al(OH)2 +) is thought to be the most toxic. Under very acid\r\nconditions, the toxic effects of the high H+ concentration appear to be more\r\nimportant than the effects of low concentrations of aluminium; at approximately\r\nneutral pH values, the toxicity of aluminium is greatly reduced. The solubility\r\nof aluminium is also enhanced under alkaline conditions, due to its amphoteric\r\ncharacter, and some researchers found that the acute toxicity of aluminium\r\nincreased from pH 7 to pH 9. However, the opposite relationship was found in\r\nother studies. The uptake and toxicity of aluminium in freshwater organisms\r\ngenerally decreases with increasing water hardness under acidic, neutral and\r\nalkaline conditions. Complexing agents such as fluoride, citrate and humic\r\nsubstances reduce the availability of aluminium to organisms, resulting in\r\nlower toxicity. Silicon can also reduce aluminium toxicity to fish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking\r\nWater Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">aluminium:\r\n200 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">200 ug/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">chloride:\r\n400 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">250 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">fluoride:\r\n1.5 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">1.5 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">nitrate:\r\n50 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">50 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">sulfate:\r\n250 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil\r\nGuideline: none available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air\r\nQuality Standards: none available.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The TLV is based on the exposures to aluminium chloride and the amount of hydrolysed acid and the corresponding acid TLV to provide the same degree of freedom from irritation.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Estimations based on a \"highly\" dispersed\r\npolymer population suggest that a polymer of approximate molecular weight 5000\r\ncould contain no more than one reactive group of high concern for it to be\r\nregulated as a polymer of low concern (a so-called PLC) Polymers with a\r\nmolecular weight above 10000 are generally considered to be PLCs because these\r\nare not expected to be absorbed by biological systems. The choice of 10000 as a\r\ncut-off value is thought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as\r\nreasonable in light of limited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which\r\neffects are seen, and extrapolation from animals to humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ingredients in the Acrylates\r\nCopolymer group all contain the monomers acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or\r\none of their salts or esters. These ingredients are considered similar in that\r\nthey are uniformly produced in chemical reactions that leave very little\r\nresidual monomer. Although residual acrylic acid may be as high as 1500 ppm,\r\ntypical levels are 10 to 1000 ppm. There is sufficient odor if residual\r\nmonomers are present to cause producers to keep levels as low as possible.\r\nThese ingredients function in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair\r\nfixatives, suspending agents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion\r\nstabilizers. Concentrations may be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film\r\nformer, or fixative; or as low as 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent,\r\nsuspending agent, or emulsion stabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit\r\nlittle toxicity. In rabbits and guinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce\r\nirritation, but no evidence of sensitization was found. The principle concern\r\nregarding the use of these polymer ingredients is the presence of toxic\r\nresidual monomers. In particular, although 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ngenotoxic, it was carcinogenic when applied at a concentration of 21% to the\r\nskin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations (2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high\r\nconcentrations (43%) were not carcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ncarcinogenic in studies using NMRI mice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis\r\nwas seen or not, there was evidence of severe dermal irritation in these\r\n2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another concern regarding residual monomers was\r\ninhalation toxicity. Although the acrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant,\r\nexposure to the monomer from use of these polymers in cosmetic formulations\r\nwould always be less than the established occupational exposure limits for\r\nnasal irritation. Although there appears to be a huge variation in the mix of\r\nmonomers used in the synthesis of these polymers, they are similar in that the\r\npolymers, except for dermal irritation, are not significantly toxic, and\r\nresidual monomer levels are kept as low as possible. Although the monomers may\r\nbe toxic, the levels that would be found in cosmetic formulations are not\r\nconsidered to present a safety risk. Accordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are\r\nconsidered safe for use in cosmetic formulations when formulated to avoid\r\nirritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>",

On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

It is not\r\nbiodegradable. Due to its insolubility in water there is a separation at every\r\nfiltration and sedimentation process.]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Crystalline and/or amorphous silicas are ubiquitous on the earth\r\nin soils and sediments, and in living organisms (e.g. diatoms), but only the\r\ndissolved form is bioavailable. On a global scale, the level of man-made\r\nsynthetic amorphous silicas (SAS) represents up to 2.4% of the dissolved silica\r\nnaturally present in the aquatic environment. The rate of SAS released into the\r\nenvironment during the product life cycle is negligible in comparison with the\r\nnatural flux of silica in the environment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Untreated SASs have a relatively low water solubility of 1.91 to\r\n2.51 mmol/l (114 - 151 mg/l) and an extremely low vapour pressure (e.g. &lt;\r\n10\u20133 Pa at 20\u00b0 C for Aerosil R972). On the basis of these properties it is\r\nexpected that SAS released into the environment will be distributed mainly into\r\nsoil/sediment, slightly into water, and probably not at all into air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With surface-treated SASs, the addition of organosilicon compounds\r\nincreases the hydrophobicity. Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low. Due to the\r\npresence of organic substances such as surfactants, salts, acids and alkalis in\r\nthe environment, it is expected that surface-treated silica will be wetted and\r\nthen adsorbed onto soils or sediments</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">SAS is regarded as an inert substance and is not expected to\r\nundergo any transformation in the atmospheric or terrestrial compartment, apart\r\nfrom dissolution by water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Biodegradability in sewage treatment plant or in surface water is\r\nnot applicable to inorganic substances like SAS. Therefore the biodegradation\r\nendpoint has limited relevance for SAS. In surface modified SASs, the most\r\ncommon treating agents are organosilicon compounds and these generally\r\nrepresent less than 5% of the material. Biodegradation in sewage treatment\r\nplant or in surface water is not expected.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>The synthetic, amorphous silicas are believed to represent a very greatly reduced silicosis hazard compared to crystalline silicas and are considered to be nuisance dusts.</p> <p>When heated to high temperature and a long time, amorphous silica can produce crystalline silica on cooling. Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal.

Base material for high temperature mortars.|<p>Synthetic amorphous (non-crystalline) silica (SAS) can be divided into two groups according to whether the manufacturing process is by the wet route (precipitated silica, silica gel) or the thermal route (pyrogenic silica). Colloidal silicas (silica sols) are stable dispersions of SASs in a liquid, usually water. Furthermore, SASs, which are generally hydrophilic, may be rendered hydrophobic by surface treatment. SASs exist as highly pure, white, fluffy powders or milky-white dispersions of these powders in fluids (usually water).</p> <p>A significant proportion of the global production of SAS is rendered hydrophobic by surface modification mainly with Si-organic compounds. Surface modified (after-treated) SAS can be obtained either by physical or chemical reaction. The most common Si-organic compounds used for the treatment are hexamethyldisilazane (CAS No. 999-97-3), dimethyldichlorsilane (CAS No. 75-78-5) and polydimethylsiloxanes (e.g. CAS No. 9016-00-6). The first compound forms mono-functional moieties upon hydrolysis [(Si-O-Si(CH3)3], whereas the latter two give rise to bi-functional units [Si-O-[Si(CH3)2-O]x].\u00a0The surface treatment does not change the solid properties e.g. particle size, dissolution kinetics of the inorganic polymer silicon dioxide (silica, SiO2).

On a global scale, the level of man-made\r\nsynthetic amorphous silicas (SAS) represents up to 2.4% of the dissolved silica\r\nnaturally present in the aquatic environment. The rate of SAS released into the\r\nenvironment during the product life cycle is negligible in comparison with the\r\nnatural flux of silica in the environment</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Untreated SASs have a relatively low water solubility of 1.91 to\r\n2.51 mmol/l (114 - 151 mg/l) and an extremely low vapour pressure (e.g. &lt;\r\n10\u20133 Pa at 20\u00b0 C for Aerosil R972). On the basis of these properties it is\r\nexpected that SAS released into the environment will be distributed mainly into\r\nsoil/sediment, slightly into water, and probably not at all into air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">With surface-treated SASs, the addition of organosilicon compounds\r\nincreases the hydrophobicity. Consequently, the water solubility is lower than\r\nthat of untreated silica. The vapour pressure remains extremely low.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Inhalation of dusts containing crystalline silicas may lead to silicosis, a disabling pulmonary fibrosis that may take years to develop. Discrepancies between various studies showing that fibrosis associated with chronic exposure to amorphous silica and those that do not may be explained by assuming that diatomaceous earth (a non-synthetic silica commonly used in industry) is either weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic and that fibrosis is due to contamination by crystalline silica content</p> <p>Repeated exposure to synthetic amorphous silicas may produce skin dryness and cracking.</p> <p>\u00a0Available data confirm the absence of significant toxicity by oral and dermal routes of exposure.</p> <p>Numerous repeated-dose, subchronic and chronic inhalation toxicity studies have been conducted in a number of species, at airborne concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg/m3 to 150 mg/m3. Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Acrylic resin is a common ingredient in latex paint (UK: \"emulsion paint\"). Interior and exterior latex paints with a greater proportion of acrylic resin, versus vinyl, offer better stain protection, greater water resistance, better adhesion, greater resistance to cracking and blistering, and resistance to alkali cleansers. Acrylic resin is considered extremely weatherproof. This makes it ideal for outdoor applications. In solid form acrylic resin can even last for decades. It does not yellow when exposed to sunlight, even after years. The Acrylic Resins are the materials which when added to latex (",

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Estimations based on a \"highly\" dispersed\r\npolymer population suggest that a polymer of approximate molecular weight 5000\r\ncould contain no more than one reactive group of high concern for it to be\r\nregulated as a polymer of low concern (a so-called PLC) Polymers with a\r\nmolecular weight above 10000 are generally considered to be PLCs because these\r\nare not expected to be absorbed by biological systems. The choice of 10000 as a\r\ncut-off value is thought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as\r\nreasonable in light of limited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which\r\neffects are seen, and extrapolation from animals to humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ingredients in the Acrylates\r\nCopolymer group all contain the monomers acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or\r\none of their salts or esters. These ingredients are considered similar in that\r\nthey are uniformly produced in chemical reactions that leave very little\r\nresidual monomer. Although residual acrylic acid may be as high as 1500 ppm,\r\ntypical levels are 10 to 1000 ppm. There is sufficient odor if residual\r\nmonomers are present to cause producers to keep levels as low as possible.\r\nThese ingredients function in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair\r\nfixatives, suspending agents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion\r\nstabilizers. Concentrations may be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film\r\nformer, or fixative; or as low as 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent,\r\nsuspending agent, or emulsion stabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit\r\nlittle toxicity. In rabbits and guinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce\r\nirritation, but no evidence of sensitization was found. The principle concern\r\nregarding the use of these polymer ingredients is the presence of toxic\r\nresidual monomers. In particular, although 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ngenotoxic, it was carcinogenic when applied at a concentration of 21% to the\r\nskin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations (2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high\r\nconcentrations (43%) were not carcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not\r\ncarcinogenic in studies using NMRI mice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis\r\nwas seen or not, there was evidence of severe dermal irritation in these\r\n2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another concern regarding residual monomers was\r\ninhalation toxicity. Although the acrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant,\r\nexposure to the monomer from use of these polymers in cosmetic formulations\r\nwould always be less than the established occupational exposure limits for\r\nnasal irritation. Although there appears to be a huge variation in the mix of\r\nmonomers used in the synthesis of these polymers, they are similar in that the\r\npolymers, except for dermal irritation, are not significantly toxic, and\r\nresidual monomer levels are kept as low as possible. Although the monomers may\r\nbe toxic, the levels that would be found in cosmetic formulations are not\r\nconsidered to present a safety risk. Accordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are\r\nconsidered safe for use in cosmetic formulations when formulated to avoid\r\nirritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>",
