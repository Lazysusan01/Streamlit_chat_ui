This term can be used to describe \u201csingle-component\u201d paints that dry\r\nin the air (whether latex house paint, or old school lacquer) and nearly all\r\naerosol spray can paints.\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Coatings based on aliphatic\r\npolyisocyanates, for example, usually need longer drying times than those based\r\non aromatic polyisocyanates. Drying times depend on the presence of atmospheric\r\nmoisture, as well as the temperature. One-component systems can generally cure\r\nat a wide range of temperatures. Coatings based on polyisocyanates or on\r\nNCO-functional prepolymers may harden at room temperature. Those based on\r\nblocked NCO prepolymers will require baking at temperatures up to 180 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Weathering properties of 1K\r\ncoatings also largely depend on the isocyanate basis used. Coatings based on\r\ntoluylene diisocyanate (TDI) or diphenlymethane diisocyanate (MDI)\r\npolyisocyanates have a tendency to yellow when exposed to light and display a\r\ncertain loss of gloss with weathering. Those based on hexamethylene\r\ndiisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and Desmodur W (H12MDI) are\r\nlight stable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">2K polyurethane (PU) systems dry\r\nrelatively quickly without exposure to heat due to their reactive NCO groups.\r\nIn some applications, these systems are force-dried at up to 80 deg C or baked\r\nat temperatures above 120 deg C to yield even shorter curing times. This\r\nresults in faster production cycles and increased efficiency. A 2K coating is\r\nmixed with a hardener, catalyst or activator. Once it hardens it is much less\r\nsusceptible to damage from chemicals, weather, or UV rays.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Typically the term\r\n\"catalyst\" (as in epoxy catalyst) is used separately from the terms\r\n\"activator\" and \"hardener\" because a catalyst does not have\r\nisocyanate.</span></p>",

When the crystals are melted, the container\r\nshould be agitated by rolling or stirring, until the contents are homogenous.\r\nSince heated isocyanate will generate vapors more rapidly than product stored\r\nat 25 deg C (77 deg F), be sure to follow the precautions under the Personal Protection.</span></p> <ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Store in original containers.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Keep containers securely sealed.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">No smoking, naked lights or ignition sources.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Store away from incompatible materials and foodstuff containers.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Protect containers against physical damage and check regularly for leaks.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:#000000\">Observe manufacturer's storage and handling recommendations contained within this SDS.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>",

All of them function on the  principle of colourimetric evaluation of an indicator paper strip. They  are operating continuously and unattended. Paper tape systems are easy  to use and do not require skilled analysts to operate them. They give  rapid results and are therefore suitable for leak detection and in  emergency situations.

In order  to obtain reliable results only laboratories with experience in that  specific area should be engaged with such measurements<br /><br />In the  evaluation of the German MAK Commission the justification of the OEL for  4,4\u00b4- MDI/ pMDI is established based on the isocyanate (NCO) group  which is common to the monomeric, oligomeric and the polymeric MDIs.  This NCO group is highly reactive (see toxicokinetics and category  justification for details). Due to this high reactivity of the  functional NCO group towards nucleophilic biomolecules the primary  health effect of MDI is irritation at the point of contact, which can be  demonstrated by the numerous acute, subacute and chronic bioassays, and  sensitization.<br />The most sensitive health effect resulting from acute  inhalation exposure to respirable aerosols of MDI is irritation to  predominately the bronchio-alveolar part of the respiratory tract.<br />After  inhalation exposure, MDI reacts with nucleophilic low and  higher-molecular components of the liquid films that cover the airways,  glutathione (GSH) represents the most important nucleophile in  quantitative terms. The low-molecular adducts or conjugates of MDI are  absorbed and direct transcarbamoylation results in plasma protein  adducts (albumin, haemoglobin). All observed health effects resulting  from exposure to respirable aerosols in acute, subchronic or chronic  bioassays and human studies can be allocated to primary alveolar  reactivity (respiratory irritation and/or sensitization). No systemic  effect other than secondary to primary irritation has been described. <br />Biomonitoring  for exposure to diisocyanates typically looks to assay derivatives  (diamines) following hydrolysis of biological fluids and is routinely  employed to measure occupational exposure to MDI and other  diisocyanates. For diamine analysis, samples of urine are typically  used, although blood samples can also be used. However, these markers  are not specific for the diisocyanate exposure. The urine biomarkers  (after acid or base hydrolysis) reflected recent exposures whereas  certain haemoglobin (Hb)\u00a0 biomarkers did not necessarily correlate with  the urine biomarkers, and were considered to reflect overall exposures  over a longer term. The hydrolysis methods and conditions used release  differing amounts of the diamine analyte.<br />Hydrolysis analytes are at  low concentrations and proportionally little of the dose is in urine or  blood, and that there is no standardised method for measuring biomarkers  in hydrolyzed urine. Investigation of diisocyanate specific biomarkers  has focused on the conjugated molecules in blood. Typically, conjugates  with Hb or albumin (Alb) have been assessed, and\u00a0 there has been  progress in application of experiments in animals to biomonitoring of  human exposures to MDI. \u00a0<br />The role for glutathione as an intermediary  in transport of diisocyanates is now supported by good evidence using  various model compounds. The most probable reactions of isocyanates with  biological macromolecules are with the amine (mixed urea), the hydroxyl  (carbamate) and the sulphydryl (thiolytic acid ester) and that latter  is of a reversible nature.<br />The thiocarbamate bond of  isocyanate-sulphydryl is reversible, and various authors have found  release and transfer of MDI moieties from thiocarbamate conjugates to  other nucleophiles, notably protein. The conjugates were shown to be  recognised by serum IgG from MDI exposed workers, demonstrating a  non-enzymatic, thiol-mediated transcarbamolyating mechanism to protein. <br />The  methods to identify and quantify MDI-adducts to plasma proteins  particularly albumin (Alb) and to haemoglobin (Hb) have now been applied  to biological monitoring, particularly useful since the amount of  adducts would be indicative of an integrated exposure. In addition these  adducts are specific for MDI exposure. However the total amount of the  analyte MDA, retrievable from Hb-adducts and urinary precursors,  accounts for less than 0.5 % of the applied dose of MDI, and the lack of  linearity of biomarker to exposure dose makes uncertain the  extrapolation from the yield of biomarkers in urine or blood towards  inhalative MDI exposure. The use of protein adducts for biomonitoring  appears to overcome some of these difficulties and benefits from  specificity of the analyte. To date no diisocyanate specific urinary  biomarker has been identified. For blood, the MDI-specific methods  developed are: Hb-conjugate derived hydantoin, Alb-lysine conjugates and  peptide conjugates. On the basis of limits of detection, the  Hb-hydantoin method is most sensitive compared to the Alb-lysine method  which in turn is more sensitive than the signature peptide method. The  Hb-hydantoin method covers a longer period of exposure than the  Alb-lysine, due to the longer half life of the erythrocyte compared to  serum albumin.</p> <p>for 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI):</p> <p>The toxicological action of HDI is similar to that of toluene diisocyanate and and the TLV-TWA is analogous.

This urea formation acts as a pH buffer in the  stomach, thus promoting transformation of\u00a0 the diisocyanate into  polyurea, even under the acidic conditions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the  resorbtive tissues in the small intestine, these high molecular reaction  products are likely to be of very low bioavailability, which is  substantiated by the absence of systemic toxicity in acute oral  bioassays with rats at the OECD limit dose (LC50&gt;2 g/kg bw).<br />The  respiratory tract may be regarded as the main entry for systemically  available isocyanates as evidenced following MDI.exposures. <br />A  detailed summary on urinary, plasma and in vitro metabolite studies is  provided below. Taken together, all available studies provide convincing  evidence that MDI-protein adduct and MDI-metabolite formation proceeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>via formation of a labile isocyanate glutathione (GSH)-adduct, </li>\n<li>then transfer to a more stable adduct with larger proteins, and </li>\n<li>without  formation of free MDA. MDA reported as a metabolite is actually formed  by analytical workup procedures (strong acid or base hydrolysis) and is  not an identified metabolite in urine or blood</li>\n</ul> <p>A 90-day inhalation study in rats with polymeric MDI (6 hours/day, 5 days/week) produced moderate to severe hyperplastic inflammatory lesions in the nasal cavities and lungs at levels of 8 mg/m3 or greater.<br />Rats exposed for two years to a respirable aerosol of polymeric MDI exhibited chronic pulmonary irritation at high concentrations. Only at the highest level (6 mg/m3),was there a significant incidence of a benign tumour of the lung (adenoma) and one malignant tumour (adenocarcinoma).There were no lung tumours at 1 mg/m3 and no effects at 0.2 mg/m3. Overall, the tumour incidence, both benign and malignant and\u00a0 the number of animals with the tumours were not different from controls.The increased incidence of lung tumours is associated with prolonged respiratory irritation and the concurrent accumulation of yellow material in the lung, which occurred throughout the study.In the absence of prolonged exposure to high concentrations leading to chronic irritation and lung damage,it is highly unlikely that tumour formation will occur.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>CONTAINS</b>\u00a0free organic isocyanate. Mixing and application requires special precautions and use of personal protective gear [APMF]</p> <p>Isocyanate vapours/mists are irritating to the upper respiratory tract and lungs; the response may be severe enough to produce bronchitis with wheezing, gasping and severe distress, even sudden loss of consciousness, and pulmonary oedema. Possible neurological symptoms arising from isocyanate exposure include headache, insomnia, euphoria, ataxia, anxiety neurosis, depression and paranoia. Gastrointestinal disturbances are characterised by nausea and vomiting. Pulmonary sensitisation may produce asthmatic reactions ranging from minor breathing difficulties to severe allergic attacks; this may occur following a single acute exposure or may develop without warning after a period of tolerance. A respiratory response may occur following minor skin contact. Skin sensitisation is possible and may result in allergic dermatitis responses including rash, itching, hives and swelling of extremities.</p> <p>\u00a0Isocyanate-containing vapours/ mists may cause inflammation of eyes and nasal passages.</p> <p>Onset of symptoms may be immediate or delayed for several hours after exposure. Sensitised people can react to very low levels of airborne isocyanates. Unprotected or sensitised persons should not be allowed to work in situations allowing exposure to this material.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

In 96-hr algal toxicity testing, results indicate that ethylbenzene inhibits algae growth in\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornatum\u00a0</i>at 3.6 mg/L and in\u00a0<i>Skeletonema costatum\u00a0</i>at 7.7 mg/L.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic).

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis.

Volatilisation of n-butyl acetate is expected from moist soil surfaces given its Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilisation from dry soil surfaces is expected based on a measured vapor pressure of 11.5 mm Hg. Using a standard BOD dilution technique and a sewage inoculum, theoretical BODs of 56 % to 86 % were observed during 5-20 day incubation periods, which suggests that n-butyl acetate may biodegrade in soil.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: An estimated Koc value indicates that n-butyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Butyl acetate is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on a Henry's Law constant of 2.8x10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 127, hours respectively. An estimated BCF value of 10 based on the log Kow, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using a filtered sewage seed, 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 58 % and 83 % were measured in freshwater dilution tests; 5-day and 20-day theoretical BODs of 40 % and 61 % were measured in salt water. A 5-day theoretical BOD of 56.8 % and 51.8 % were measured for n-butyl acetate in distilled water and seawater, respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate for this compound based upon experimentally determined hydrolysis half-lives of 114 and 11 days at pH 8 and 9 respectively.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, n-butyl acetate, which has a vapour pressure of 11.5 mm Hg at 25 deg C, is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase n-butyl acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 4 days</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h, 23 C): island silverside (Menidia beryllina) 185 ppm (static bioassay in synthetic seawater, mild aeration applied after 24 h); bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 100 ppm (static bioassay in fresh water, mild aeration applied after 24 h)</p> <p>Fish EC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 18 mg/l (affected fish lost equilibrium prior to death)\u00a0</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (48 h): 44 ppm</p> <p>Algal LC50 (96 h): Scenedesmus 320 ppm</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilisation of methyl ethyl ketone from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is also expected given the measured Henry's Law constant of 4.7x10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The volatilisation half-life of methyl ethyl ketone from silt and sandy loams was measured as 4.9 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as indicated by numerous screening tests.\u00a0</p> <p>AQUATIC FATE: Based on Koc values, methyl ethyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. Methyl ethyl ketone is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 and 197, hours respectively. Biodegradation of this compound is expected based upon numerous screening tests. An estimated BCF value of 1 based on an experimental log Kow of 0.29, suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.\u00a0</p> <p>ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, methyl ethyl ketone, which has an experimental vapor pressure of 91 mm Hg at 25 deg C, will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase methyl ethyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 days. Methyl ethyl ketone is also expected to undergo photodecomposition in the atmosphere by natural sunlight. Photochemical degradation of methyl ethyl ketone by natural sunlight is expected to occur at approximately 1/5 the rate of degradation by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 1690-5640 mg/l; guppy (Lebistes reticulatus) 5700 mg/l; goldfish (Carassius auratus) &gt;5000 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 3200 mg/l; bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 4467 mg/l; mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) 5600 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h):&lt;520-1382 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (24 h): 8890 mg/l</p> <p>Brine shrimp (Artemia salina) LC50 (24 h): 1950 mg/l</p> <p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.
