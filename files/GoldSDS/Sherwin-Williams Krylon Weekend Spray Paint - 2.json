In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant.

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments The liquid may produce considerable gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful or toxic if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Exposure to aliphatic alcohols with more than 3 carbons may produce central nervous system effects such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, muscle weakness, delirium, CNS depression, coma, seizure, and neurobehavioural changes. Symptoms are more acute with higher alcohols. Respiratory tract involvement may produce irritation of the mucosa, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory depression secondary to CNS depression, pulmonary oedema, chemical pneumonitis and bronchitis. Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p> <p>The odour of isopropanol may give some warning of exposure, but odour fatigue may occur. Inhalation of isopropanol may produce irritation of the nose and throat with sneezing, sore throat and runny nose.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p> <p>Following ingestion, a single exposure to isopropyl alcohol produced lethargy and non-specific effects such as weight loss and irritation. Ingestion of near-lethal doses of isopropanol produces histopathological changes of the stomach, lungs and kidneys, incoordination, lethargy, gastrointestinal tract irritation, and inactivity or anaesthesia.</p> <p>Swallowing 10 ml. of isopropanol may cause serious injury; 100 ml. may be fatal if not promptly treated. The adult single lethal doses is approximately 250 ml. The toxicity of isopropanol is twice that of ethanol and the symptoms of intoxication appear to be similar except for the absence of an initial euphoric effect; gastritis and vomiting are more prominent. Ingestion may cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.</p> <p>There is evidence that a slight tolerance to isopropanol may be acquired.\u00a0</p> <p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

A substantial amount of acetone can also be found in water, which is consistent with the high water to air partition coefficient and its small, but detectable, presence in rain water, sea water, and lake water samples. Very little acetone is expected to reside in soil, biota, or suspended solids. This is entirely consistent with the physical and chemical properties of acetone and with measurements showing a low propensity for soil absorption and a high preference for moving through the soil and into the ground water</p> <p>In air, acetone is lost by photolysis and reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; the estimated half-life of these combined processes is about 22 days. The relatively long half-life allows acetone to be transported long distances from its emission source.</p> <p>Acetone is highly soluble and slightly persistent in water, with a half-life of about 20 hours; it is minimally toxic to aquatic life.</p> <p>Acetone released to soil volatilises although some may leach into the ground where it rapidly biodegrades.</p> <p>Acetone does not concentrate in the food chain.</p> <p>Acetone meets the OECD definition of readily biodegradable which requires that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) is at least 70% of the theoretical oxygen demand (THOD) within the 28-day test period</p> <p>Drinking Water Standard: none available.</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: none available.</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: none available.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Testing shows that acetone exhibits a low order of toxicity</p> <p>Fish LC50: brook trout 6070 mg/l; fathead minnow 15000 mg/l</p> <p>Bird LC0 (5 day): Japanese quail, ring-neck pheasant 40,000 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): 15800 mg/l; NOEC 8500 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate 2100 - 16700 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic plant NOEC: 5400-7500 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna chronic NOEC 1660 mg/l</p> <p>Acetone vapors were shown to be relatively toxic to two types insects and their eggs. The time to 50% lethality (LT50) was found to be 51.2 hr and 67.9 hr when the flour beetle (<i>Tribolium confusum</i>) and the flour moth (<i>Ephestia kuehniella</i>) were exposed to an airborne acetone concentration of 61.5 mg/m3. The LT50 values for the eggs were 30-50% lower than for the adult. The direct application of acetone liquid to the body of the insects or surface of the eggs did not, however, cause any mortality.</p> <p>The ability of acetone to inhibit cell multiplication has been examined in a wide variety of microorganisms. The results have generally indicated mild to minimal toxicity with NOECs greater than 1700 mg/L for exposures lasting from 6 hr to 4 days. Longer exposure periods of 7 to 8 days with bacteria produced mixed results; but overall the data indicate a low degree of toxicity for acetone. The only exception to these findings were the results obtained with the flagellated protozoa (<i>Entosiphon sulcatum</i>) which yielded a 3-day NOEC of 28 mg/L.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Systemic effects of acetone inhalation exposure include central nervous system depression, light-headedness, incoherent speech, ataxia, stupor, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia and ketosis. Rarely, convulsions and tubular necrosis may be evident. Other symptoms of exposure may include restlessness, headache, vomiting, low blood-pressure and rapid and irregular pulse, eye and throat irritation, weakness of the legs and dizziness. Inhalation of high concentrations may produce dryness of the mouth and throat, nausea, uncoordinated movement, loss of coordinated speech, drowsiness and, in severe cases, coma. Inhalation of acetone vapours over long periods causes irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing and headache. Rats exposed to 52200 ppm vapour for 1 hour showed clear signs of narcosis; fatalities occurred at 126600 ppm.</p> <p>Exposure to ketone vapours may produce nose, throat and mucous membrane irritation. High concentrations of vapour may produce central nervous system depression characterised by headache, vertigo, loss of coordination, narcosis and cardiorespiratory failure. Some ketones produce neurological disorders (polyneuropathy) characterised by bilateral symmetrical paresthesia and muscle weakness primarily in the legs and arms.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause severe eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>The liquid may produce eye discomfort and is capable of causing temporary impairment of vision and/or transient eye inflammation, ulceration</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "Large ingestions may produce coma, respiratory depression, and rarely, convulsions.|<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p><p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>",

The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

Animal experiments have shown that dusts of titanium and several compounds exhibit only slight toxicity. Such toxic actions (limited to soluble titanium salts) may be related to an ability to inhibit the action of the enzyme tyrosinase on DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). A further as yet unexplored mechanism may involve substitution by titanium for several metals (such as vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and zinc) which perform essential biologic functions; all have a similar atomic radius</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis of epidemiological data, it has been concluded that prolonged inhalation of the material, in an occupational setting, may produce cancer in humans.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to the dusts of titanium and several of its compounds produces chronic lung disease (fibrosis) in animals. Radiological evidence exists amongst titanium dioxide workers suggesting chronic lung changes which resemble a slight form of silicosis. Workers chronically exposed to titanium or titanium dioxide dusts show a high incidence of chronic bronchitis (endobronchitis and peribronchitis). Early stages of this disease are characterised by impaired pulmonary respiration and ventilatory capacity and by reduced blood alkalinity. Cardiac changes characteristic of pulmonary disease (with hypertrophy of the right auricle) have also been observed amongst workers.\u00a0</p> <p>Titanium employed in implants has provoked immune responses which occur locally as metallosis and systemically as raised serum levels of activated T-lymphocytes. Some concern has been expressed about the potential for generating bone-resorbing mediators associated with titanium wear-debris.</p> <p>The largest of the cohort studies was among white male production workers in the titanium dioxide industry in six European countries. The study indicated a slightly increased risk for lung cancer compared with the general population. However, there was no evidence of an exposure-response relationship within the cohort. No increase in the mortality rates for kidney cancer was found when the cohort was compared with the general population, but there was a suggestion of an exposure-response relationship in internal analyses. The other cohort studies, both of which were conducted in the USA, did not report an increased risk for lung cancer or cancer at any other site; no results for kidney cancer were reported, presumably because there were few cases.</p> <p>One population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal did not indicate an increased risk for lung or kidney cancer.</p> <p>In summary, the studies do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide as it occurred in recent decades in western Europe and North America and risk for cancer.</p> <p>All the studies had methodological limitations; misclassification of exposure could not be ruled out. None of the studies was designed to assess the impact of particle size (fine or ultrafine) or the potential effect of the coating compounds on the risk for lung cancer.\u00a0</p> <p>An increased incidence of lung adenomas in rats of both sexes and of cystic keratinising lesions, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas in female rats, was seen in animals subject to high doses of inhaled titanium dioxide. Intratracheal delivery of titanium dioxide in combination with benz[a]pyrene produced an increase in benign and malignant tumours of the larynx, trachea and lungs in hamsters.</p> <p>Squamous cell carcinomas developed after exposure to 250 mg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years in rats; the type of carcinoma that developed was considered to be a unique experimentally induced tumour and to be of questionable relevance for extrapolation of the results to humans. Given the extremely high level of dust in the lungs, the carcinomas were postulated to be the result of saturation of the normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms. At 50 mg/m3, massive accumulations of dust-laden macrophages, foamy dust cells and free particles were considered indicative of such overload.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p> <p>A fire in bulk finely divided carbon may not be obviously visible unless the material is disturbed and sparks appear.

                "StorageIncompatability": "<p>For carbon powders:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid oxidising agents, reducing agents.\u00a0</li> <li>Reaction with finely divided metals, bromates, chlorates, chloramine monoxide, dichlorine oxide, iodates, metal nitrates, oxygen difluoride, peroxyformic acid, peroxyfuroic acid and trioxygen difluoride may result in an exotherm with ignition or explosion. Less active forms of carbon will ignite or explode on suitably intimate contact with oxygen, oxides, peroxides, oxosalts, halogens, interhalogens and other oxidising species.\u00a0</li> <li>Explosive reaction with ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, calcium hypochlorite and iodine pentoxide may occur following heating. Carbon may react violently with nitric acid and may be explosively reactive with nitrogen trifluoride at reduced temperatures. In the presence of nitrogen oxide, incandescence and ignition may occur. Finely divided or highly porous forms of carbon, exhibiting a high surface area to mass (up to 2000 m2/g) may function as unusually active fuels possessing both adsorptive and catalytic properties which accelerate the release of energy in the presence of oxidising substances. Dry metal-impregnated charcoal catalysts may generate sufficient static, during handling, to cause ignition.\u00a0</li> <li>Graphite in contact with liquid potassium, rubidium or caesium at 300 deg. C. produces intercalation compounds (C8M) which ignite in air and may react explosively with water. The fusion of powdered diamond and potassium hydroxide may produce explosive decomposition.\u00a0</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Activated carbon, when exposed to air, represents a potential fire hazard due to a high surface area and adsorptive capacity. Freshly prepared material may ignite spontaneously in the presence of air especially at high humidity. Spontaneous combustion in air may occur at 90-100 deg. C. The presence of moisture in air facilitates the ignition. Drying oils and oxidising oils promote spontaneous heating and ignition; contamination with these must be avoided. Unsaturated drying oils (linseed oil etc.) may ignite following adsorption owing to an enormous increase in the surface area of oil exposed to air; the rate of oxidation may also be catalysed by metallic impurities in the carbon. A similar, but slower effect occurs on fibrous materials such as cotton waste. Spontaneous heating of activated carbon is related to the composition and method of preparation of the activated carbon. Free radicals, present in charcoal, are responsible for autoignition. Self-heating and autoignition may also result from adsorption of various vapours and gases (especially oxygen). For example, activated carbon auto- ignites in flowing air at 452-518 deg. C.; when the base, triethylenediamine, is adsorbed on the carbon (5%) the autoignition temperature is reduced to 230-260 deg. C.. An exotherm is produced at 230-260 deg. C., at high flow rates of air, although ignition did not occur until 500 deg. C.. Mixtures of sodium borohydride with activated carbons, in air, promote the oxidation of sodium borohydride, producing a self-heating reaction that may result in the ignition of charcoal and in the production of hydrogen through thermal decomposition of the borohydride.\u00a0</li> </ul>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage.

There is suggestive but\r\ninconclusive evidence that carbon black containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons\r\n(PAHs) has been responsible for induction of skin cancers in exposed workers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Long term inhalation of carbon black can cause cough,\r\nphlegm, tiredness,chest pain and headache. Dermal, mucosal, or inhalation\r\nexposure can cause irritation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Inhalation of carbon black by mice,rats and monkeys caused\r\nthickened alveolar walls, increased pulmonary collagen, right atrial and\r\nventricular strain, hypertrophy of the right atrial and ventricular septum and\r\nincreased heart weights. Although carbon black itself did not cause cancer in\r\ntreated animals, carbon black containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) did\r\ncause cancer following chronic administration by all routes tested.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Epidemiological studies of workers in the carbon black\r\nproducing industries of North America and Western Europe show no significant\r\nhealth effect due to occupational exposure to carbon black. Several other\r\nstudies provide conflicting evidence. Early studies in the former USSR and\r\nEastern Europe report respiratory diseases amongst workers exposed to carbon\r\nblack, including bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema and rhinitis. These studies\r\nare of questionable validity due to inadequate study design and methodology,\r\nlack of appropriate controls for cigarette smoking and other confounding\r\nfactors such as concurrent exposure to carbon dioxide, coal oil and petroleum\r\nvapours. Moreover, review of these studies indicates that the concentrations of\r\ncarbon black were greater than current occupational standards.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black may cause adverse pulmonary changes following\r\nprolonged or repeated inhalation of the dust; these include oral mucosal\r\nlesions, bronchitis and pneumoconiosis which may lead to lung tumours.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The body of evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies\r\ncomes from two chronic inhalation studies and two intratracheal instillation\r\nstudies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in\r\nexposed animals. An inhalation study was tested on mice, but did not show\r\nsignificantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic\r\ndata comes from three different cohort studies of carbon black production\r\nworkers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000\r\nworkers in each study group, showed elevated mortality from lung cancer in the\r\ncarbon black workers. Another study of over 5,000 workers in the United States\r\ndid not show elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers.\r\nNewer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK\r\nstudy may suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However,\r\na more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis\r\nthat carbon black acts as a late-stage carcinogen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In studies employing channel and furnace black, hamsters,\r\nmice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys exposed to dusts for 7 hours/day, 5\r\ndays/week, at concentrations of 87.4 mg/m3 for channel black and 56.5 mg/m3 for\r\nfurnace black, no malignancies were observed in any of the animals. Channel\r\nblack had little if any absorbed polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (as benzene\r\nextractables) whilst furnace black had 0.28%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Several findings have strengthened the association between\r\ninflammation and cancer and between the particle surface area dose of carbon\r\nblack and other\u00a0 poorly soluble low toxicity (PSLT) particles and the pulmonary\r\ninflammation response in mice and the proinflammatory effects in lung cells in\r\nvitro. Other evidence suggests that in addition to a cancer mechanism involving\r\nindirect genotoxicity through inflammation and oxidative stress, nanoparticles\r\nmay act as direct carcinogens .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black appears to act like PSLT particles, which can\r\nelicit lung tumours in rats following prolonged exposure to sufficiently high\r\nconcentrations of particles. Particle surface area dose was found to be most\r\npredictive of pulmonary inflammation and tumour response in rats when comparing\r\nthe dose-response relationships for various types and sizes of PSLT including\r\ncarbon black. Compared to fine PSLT, much lower concentrations of ultrafine\r\nPSLT (e.g. 2.5, 6.5 or 11.5 mg/m3 carbon black and ~10 mg/m3 ultrafine titanium\r\ndioxide) were associated with impaired clearance, persistent inflammation, and\r\nmalignant lung tumours in chronic inhalation studies in rats. Most evidence\r\nsuggests that carbon black and other PSLT-elicited lung tumours occurs through\r\na secondary genotoxic mechanism, involving chronic inflammation and oxidative\r\nstress. Experimental studies have shown that when the particle lung dose\r\nreaches a sufficiently high concentration (e.g.,mass dose of ~0.5 mg fine-sized\r\nPSLT/g lung in rats), the alveolar macrophage-medicated clearance process\r\nbegins to be impaired (complete impairment occurs at ~10 mg/g lung. Overloading\r\nof lung clearance is accompanied by pulmonary inflammation, leading to\r\nincreased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, depletion of\r\nantioxidants and/or impairment of other defense mechanisms, cell injury, cell\r\nproliferation, fibrosis, and as seen in rats,\u00a0 induction of mutations and\r\neventually cancer. Rats appear to be more sensitive to carbon black and other\r\nPSLT than other rodent species. Although studies in humans have not shown a\r\ndirect link between inhaled PSLT and lung cancer, many of the steps in the\r\nmechanism observed in rats have also been observed in humans who work in dusty\r\njobs, including increased particle lung retention and pulmonary inflammation in\r\nworkers exposed to coal dust or crystalline silica and elevated lung cancer has\r\nbeen observed in some studies of workers exposed to carbon black, crystalline\r\nsilica, and diesel exhaust particles</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Monkeys exposed to channel black for 1000-1500 hours showed\r\nevidence of electrocardiac changes indicative of right atrial and right\r\nventricular strain. These changes increased progressively until after 10,000\r\nhours of exposure, when the changes were marked. The authors of this study\r\nconcluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged exposure other\r\nthan those expected from the accumulation of non-toxic dusts in the pulmonary\r\nsystem. Exposure to furnace black produced a similar picture although\r\nelectrocardiographic change was first observed in monkeys after 2500 hours'\r\nexposure and marked atrial and right ventricular strain after 10,000 hours' exposure.\r\nThe authors concluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged\r\nexposure other than those expected from the accumulation of nontoxic dusts in\r\nthe pulmonary system.

                "Environment": "<p>For propane:</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate</b></p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate:</b>: An estimated Koc value of 460 determined from a log Kow of 2.36 indicates that propane is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. Volatilisation of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07x10-1 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg, and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L. Propane is expected to volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using cell suspensions of microorganisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidised to acetone within 24 hours, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>The estimated Koc value indicates that propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law constant volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are estimated to be 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively. \u00a0An estimated BCF of 13.1 using log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. After 192 hr, the trace concentration of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate</b>:: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour pressure, propane is expected to exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

During subsequent processing, radon tends to concentrate in liquefied petroleum streams and in product streams having similar boiling points. Industry experience indicates that the commercial product may contain small amounts of radon-222 and its radioactive decay products (radon daughters). The actual concentration of radon-222 and radioactive daughters in process equipment (IE lines, filters, pumps and reactor units) may reach significant levels and produce potentially damaging levels of gamma radiation. A potential external radiation hazard exists at or near any pipe, valve or vessel containing a radon enriched stream or containing internal deposits of radioactive material. Field studies, however, have not shown that conditions exist that expose the worker to cumulative exposures in excess of general population limits. Equipment containing gamma-emitting decay products should be presumed to be internally contaminated with alpha-emitting decay products which may be hazardous if inhaled or ingested. During maintenance operations that require the opening of contaminated process equipment, the flow of gas should be stopped and a four hour delay enforced to allow gamma-radiation to drop to background levels. Protective equipment (including high efficiency particulate respirators (P3) suitable for radionucleotides or supplied air) should be worn by personnel entering a vessel or working on contaminated process equipment to prevent skin contamination or inhalation of any residue containing alpha-radiation. Airborne contamination may be minimised by handling scale and/or contaminated materials in a wet state.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>No health effects were seen in humans exposed at 1,000 ppm isobutane for up to 8 hours or 500 ppm for 8 hours/day for 10 days.

Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation. Symptoms include rapid respiration, mental dullness, lack of coordination, poor judgement, nausea and vomiting. The onset of cyanosis may lead to unconsciousness and death.</p> <p>If exposure to highly concentrated atmosphere of gas is prolonged this may lead to narcosis, unconsciousness, even coma and unless resuscitated - death.</p>",

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
