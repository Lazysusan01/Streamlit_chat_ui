Non-volatile inorganic fluoride particulates are removed from the\r\natmosphere via condensation or nucleation processes. Fluorides adsorbed on\r\nparticulate matter in the atmosphere are generally stable and are not readily\r\nhydrolysed, although they may be degraded by radiation if they persist in the\r\natmosphere. Fluorine and the silicon fluorides (fluosilicates, silicofluorides)\r\nare hydrolysed in the atmosphere to form hydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen fluoride\r\nmay combine with water vapour to produce an aerosol or fog of aqueous\r\nhydrofluoric acid.\u00a0 Based upon available data, inorganic fluoride compounds,\r\nwith the exception of sulfur hexafluoride, are not expected to remain in the\r\ntroposphere for long periods or to migrate to the stratosphere. Estimates of\r\nthe residence time of sulfur hexafluoride in the atmosphere range from 500 to\r\nseveral thousand years. Fluoride in aerosols can be transported over large\r\ndistances by wind or as a result of atmospheric turbulence. The distance\r\ntravelled is determined by the deposition velocity of both the gaseous hydrogen\r\nfluoride and the fluorides in particulate form. Atmospheric fluorides may be\r\ntransported to soils and surface waters through both wet and dry deposition\r\nprocesses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluorides undergo transformations in soil and water, forming\r\ncomplexes and binding strongly to soil and sediment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In water, the transport and transformation of inorganic fluorides\r\nare influenced by pH, water hardness and the presence of ion-exchange materials\r\nsuch as clays. In natural water, fluoride forms strong complexes with aluminum\r\nin water, and fluorine chemistry in water is largely regulated by aluminum\r\nconcentration and pH. Below pH 5, fluoride is almost entirely complexed with\r\naluminum and consequently, the concentration of free F- is low. As the pH\r\nincreases, Al-OH complexes dominate over Al-F complexes and the free F- levels\r\nincrease. Fluoride forms stable complexes with calcium and magnesium, which are\r\npresent in sea water. Calcium carbonate precipitation dominates the removal of\r\ndissolved fluoride from sea water. The residence time for fluoride in ocean\r\nsediment is calculated\u00a0 to be 2-3 million years. Fluorosilicic acid and\r\nhydrofluoric acid in high aquatic concentrations such as may be found in\r\nindustrial waste ponds may volatilise, releasing silicon tetrafluoride and\r\nhydrogen fluoride into the atmosphere. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Solubilisation of inorganic fluorides from minerals may also be\r\nenhanced by the presence of ion-exchange materials (e.g., bentonite clays and\r\nhumic acid). Once dissolved, inorganic fluorides remain in solution under\r\nconditions of low pH and hardness and in the presence of ion-exchange material.\r\nSoluble inorganic fluorides may also form aerosols at the air?water interface\r\nor vaporise into the atmosphere whereas undissolved species generally undergo\r\nsedimentation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Factors that influence the mobility of inorganic fluorides in soil\r\nare pH and the formation of aluminium and calcium complexes In more acidic\r\nsoils, concentrations of inorganic fluoride were considerably higher in the\r\ndeeper horizons. The low affinity of fluorides for organic material results in\r\nleaching from the more acidic surface horizon and increased retention by clay\r\nminerals and silts in the more alkaline, deeper horizons. The maximum\r\nadsorption of fluoride to soil was reported to occur at pH 5.5.\u00a0 In acidic\r\nsoils with pH below 6, most of the fluoride is in complexes with either\r\naluminium or iron. Fluoride in alkaline soils at pH 6.5 and above is almost\r\ncompletely fixed in soils as calcium fluoride, if sufficient calcium carbonate\r\nis available. Fluoride is extremely immobile in soil, as determined by lysimeter\r\nexperiments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Populations living in areas with high fluoride levels in\r\ngroundwater may be exposed to higher levels of fluorides in their drinking\r\nwater or in beverages prepared with the water. Among these populations, outdoor\r\nlaborers, people living in hot climates, and people with polydipsia will\r\ngenerally have the greatest daily intake of fluorides because they consume\r\ngreater amounts of water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Foods characteristically high in fluoride content are certain\r\ntypes of fish and seafood (1.9-28.5 mg/kg), especially those types in which the\r\nbones are consumed, bone products such as bone meal and gelatin, and tea, which\r\ncontains approximately 0.52 mg fluoride/cup\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fluoride is mainly absorbed by the body in the form of hydrogen\r\nfluoride, which has a p<i>K</i>a of 3.45. That is, when ionic fluoride enters\r\nthe acidic environment of the stomach lumen, it is largely converted into\r\nhydrogen fluoride. Most of the fluoride that is not absorbed from the stomach\r\nwill be rapidly absorbed from the small intestine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For fluorides:</p> <p>Based on a study in which the threshold for minimum increase in bone density due to fluoride exposure was 3.38 mg/m3 (as fluoride), the present TLV-TWA has been adopted to prevent irritant effects and disabling bone changes. There is also support for the proposition that occupational exposure below the TLV will have no adverse effect on pregnant women or off-spring. IARC has classified fluorides in drinking water as Group 3 carcinogens; i.e. Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. Equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity (osteosarcoma) has been found in male rats administered sodium fluoride in drinking water. (0-175 ppm) Evidence was not found in female rats or in male or female mice.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Local exhaust ventilation usually required.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Cardiovascular collapse is probably the principal cause of death in acute fluoride poisoning with sinus tachycardia the commonest cardiac finding and serious cardiac arrhythmias also common. Poisonings also cause major adverse effects on the brain and kidneys.</p> <p>\u00a0Toxic effects may include headache, excessive salivation, rapid movements of the eyeball (nystagmus) and dilated pupils.

Kidney injury and bleeding from injury may occur. There have occasionally been cases of accidental or suicidal poisonings by ingestion of known or unknown amounts of fluosilicate (or silicofluorides), for the most part, sodium fluosilicate, sometimes magnesium, zinc or other fluosilicates. Acute poisonings with salts of fluosilicic acid are relatively uncommon. A lethal dose for sodium fluorosilicate is approximately 1-4 g. Pathology is typical of fluoride poisoning. The main symptoms: headache, gastro-intestinal irritant, corrosion of gastric mucosa, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, hypocalcaemia, convulsions, shock, coma and death, which may occur within 15 min (the most often within 1 to 14 hrs) due to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media.

In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated\r\nby plants and animals.Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or\r\notherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental\r\nfate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminium\r\noccurs in the environment in the form of silicates, oxides and hydroxides,\r\ncombined with other elements such as sodium, fluorine and arsenic complexes\r\nwith organic matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acidification\r\nof soils releases aluminium as a transportable solution. Mobilisation of\r\naluminium by acid rain results in aluminium becoming available for plant\r\nuptake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As an\r\nelement, aluminum cannot be degraded in the environment, but may undergo\r\nvarious precipitation or ligand exchange reactions. Aluminum in compounds has\r\nonly one oxidation state (+3), and would not undergo oxidation-reduction\r\nreactions under environmental conditions. Aluminum can be complexed by various\r\nligands present in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids). The\r\nsolubility of aluminum in the environment will depend on the ligands present\r\nand the pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ntrivalent aluminum ion is surrounded by six water molecules in solution. The\r\nhydrated aluminum ion, [Al(H2O)6]3+, undergoes hydrolysis, in which a stepwise\r\ndeprotonation of the coordinated water ligands forms bound hydroxide ligands\r\n(e.g., [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+, [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+). The speciation of aluminum in water\r\nis pH dependent. The hydrated trivalent aluminum ion is the predominant form at\r\npH levels below 4. Between pH 5 and 6, the predominant hydrolysis products are\r\nAl(OH)2+ and Al(OH)2+, while the solid Al(OH)3 is most prevalent between pH 5.2\r\nand 8.8. The soluble species Al(OH)4- is the predominant species above pH 9,\r\nand is the only species present above pH 10. Polymeric aluminum hydroxides\r\nappear between pH 4.7 and 10.5, and increase in size until they are transformed\r\ninto colloidal particles of amorphous Al(OH)3, which crystallise to gibbsite in\r\nacid waters. Polymerisation is affected by the presence of dissolved silica;\r\nwhen enough silica is present, aluminum is precipitated as poorly crystallised\r\nclay mineral species.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyaluminum\r\ncompounds are considered amphoteric (e.g., they can act as both acids and bases\r\nin solution). Because of this property, aluminum hydroxides can act as buffers\r\nand resist pH changes within the narrow pH range of 4-5.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monomeric\r\naluminum compounds, typified by aluminum fluoride, chloride, and sulfate, are\r\nconsidered reactive or labile compounds, whereas polymeric aluminum species\r\nreact much more slowly in the environment. Aluminum has a stronger attraction\r\nfor fluoride in an acidic environment compared to other inorganic ligand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nadsorption of aluminum onto clay surfaces can be a significant factor in\r\ncontrolling aluminum mobility in the environment, and these adsorption\r\nreactions, measured in one study at pH 3.0-4.1, have been observed to be very\r\nrapid. However, clays may act either as a sink or a source for soluble aluminum\r\ndepending on the degree of aluminum saturation on the clay surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Within\r\nthe pH range of 5-6, aluminum complexes with phosphate and is removed from\r\nsolution. Because phosphate is a necessary nutrient in ecological systems, this\r\nimmobilization of both aluminum and phosphate may result in depleted nutrient\r\nstates in surface water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant\r\nspecies and cultivars of the same species differ considerably in their ability\r\nto take up and translocate aluminum to above-ground parts. Tea leaves may\r\ncontain very high concentrations of aluminum, &gt;5,000 mg/kg in old leaves.\r\nOther plants that may contain high levels of aluminum include Lycopodium\r\n(Lycopodiaceae), a few ferns, Symplocos (Symplocaceae), and Orites\r\n(Proteaceae). Aluminum is often taken up and concentrated in root tissue. In\r\nsub-alpine ecosystems, the large root biomass of the Douglas fir, <i>Abies\r\namabilis</i>, takes up aluminum and immobilizes it, preventing large\r\naccumulation in above-ground tissue. It is unclear to what extent aluminum is\r\ntaken up into root food crops and leafy vegetables. An uptake factor\r\n(concentration of aluminum in the plant/concentration of aluminum in soil) of\r\n0.004 for leafy vegetables and 0.00065 for fruits and tubers has been reported,\r\nbut the pH and plant species from which these uptake factors were derived are\r\nunclear. Based upon these values, however, it is clear that aluminum is not\r\ntaken up in plants from soil, but is instead biodiluted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminum\r\nconcentrations in rainbow trout from an alum-treated lake, an untreated lake,\r\nand a hatchery were highest in gill tissue and lowest in muscle. Aluminum\r\nresidue analyses in brook trout have shown that whole-body aluminum content\r\ndecreases as the fish advance from larvae to juveniles. These results imply\r\nthat the aging larvae begin to decrease their rate of aluminum uptake, to\r\neliminate aluminum at a rate that exceeds uptake, or to maintain approximately\r\nthe same amount of aluminum while the body mass increases. The decline in\r\nwhole-body aluminum residues in juvenile brook trout may be related to growth\r\nand dilution by edible muscle tissue that accumulated less aluminum than did\r\nthe other tissues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ngreatest fraction of the gill-associated aluminum was not sorbed to the gill\r\ntissue, but to the gill mucus. It is thought that mucus appears to retard\r\naluminum transport from solution to the membrane surface, thus delaying the\r\nacute biological response of the fish. It has been reported that concentrations\r\nof aluminum in whole-body tissue of the Atlantic salmon exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of aluminum ranging from 3 ug/g (for fish exposed to 33 ug/L) to\r\n96 ug/g (for fish exposed to 264 ug/L) at pH 5.5. After 60 days of exposure,\r\nBCFs ranged from 76 to 190 and were directly related to the aluminum exposure\r\nconcentration. In acidic waters (pH 4.6-5.3) with low concentrations of calcium\r\n(0.5-1.5 mg Ca/L), labile aluminum between 25 and 75 ug/L is toxic. Because\r\naluminum is toxic to many aquatic species, it is not bioaccumulated to a\r\nsignificant degree (BCF &lt;300) in most fish and shellfish; therefore,\r\nconsumption of contaminated fish does not appear to be a significant source of\r\naluminum exposure in humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioconcentration\r\nof aluminum has also been reported for several aquatic invertebrate species.\r\nBCF values ranging from 0.13 to 0.5 in the whole-body were reported for the\r\nsnail. Bioconcentration of aluminum has also been reported for aquatic insects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"color:black\">Freshwater\r\nspecies pH &gt;6.5</span></i></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish:\r\nAcute LC50 (48-96 h) 5 spp: 0.6 (<i>Salmo salar) - </i>106 mg/L; Chronic NOEC\r\n(8-28 d): 7 spp,NOEC, 0.034-7.1 mg/L.

Fish are generally more sensitive to aluminium than\r\naquatic invertebrates. Aluminium is a gill toxicant to fish, causing both\r\nionoregulatory and respiratory effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nbioavailability and toxicity of aluminium is generally greatest in acid\r\nsolutions. Aluminium in acid habitats has been observed to be toxic to fish and\r\nphytoplankton. Aluminium is generally more toxic over the pH range 4.4.5.4,\r\nwith a maximum toxicity occurring around pH 5.0.5.2. The inorganic single unit\r\naluminium species (Al(OH)2 +) is thought to be the most toxic. Under very acid\r\nconditions, the toxic effects of the high H+ concentration appear to be more\r\nimportant than the effects of low concentrations of aluminium; at approximately\r\nneutral pH values, the toxicity of aluminium is greatly reduced. The solubility\r\nof aluminium is also enhanced under alkaline conditions, due to its amphoteric\r\ncharacter, and some researchers found that the acute toxicity of aluminium\r\nincreased from pH 7 to pH 9. However, the opposite relationship was found in\r\nother studies. The uptake and toxicity of aluminium in freshwater organisms\r\ngenerally decreases with increasing water hardness under acidic, neutral and\r\nalkaline conditions. Complexing agents such as fluoride, citrate and humic\r\nsubstances reduce the availability of aluminium to organisms, resulting in\r\nlower toxicity. Silicon can also reduce aluminium toxicity to fish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking\r\nWater Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">aluminium:\r\n200 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">200 ug/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">chloride:\r\n400 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">250 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">fluoride:\r\n1.5 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">1.5 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">nitrate:\r\n50 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">50 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">sulfate:\r\n250 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil\r\nGuideline: none available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air\r\nQuality Standards: none available.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.
