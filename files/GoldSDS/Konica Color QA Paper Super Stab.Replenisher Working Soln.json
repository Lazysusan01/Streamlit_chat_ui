In addition,\r\nsorption of hydrogen sulfide from air onto soil and plant foliage occurs.\r\nHydrogen sulfide's solubility in pure water varies with temperature from 5.3\r\ng/L at 10 \u00b0C to 3.2 g/L at 30 C. \u00a0Once hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in\r\nwater, it will dissociate into bisulfide ion (HS-) and sulfide ion (S2-); the\r\nratio of the concentrations of these various ions will depend on the pH of the\r\nsolution. Hydrogen sulfide can also form insoluble sulfide salts with various metals\r\n(i.e., copper, zinc, nickel, and iron) that may be present in soils or\r\nenvironmental waters .</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide evaporates easily from water, and the rate of\r\nevaporation depends on factors such as temperature, humidity, pKa, pH, and the\r\nconcentration of certain metal ions. Hydrogen sulfide will cross the air-water\r\ninterface with kinetics similar to other unreactive gases, such as oxygen (O2),\r\nnitrogen (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2), at pHs &lt;=6. At higher pHs, such as\r\nseawater, which has a pH of 8 or greater, hydrogen sulfide escape is enhanced\r\ndue to an ionic species gradient in the water close to the surface.\r\nComplexation of bisulfide and sulfide ions to trace metal ions (i.e., Zn2+,\r\nCo2+, and Ni2+) found in seawater will also have an effect on the transport of\r\nhydrogen sulfide across the air-water interface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Clay or organic matter may sorb hydrogen sulfide. Under natural\r\nconditions, it is likely that some of the hydrogen sulfide would be oxidized to\r\nsulfate, which may be removed by leaching or taken up by plants. This, in turn,\r\nmay make gas sorption sites available for additional sorption. Several species\r\nof soil, aquatic, and marine microorganisms oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur, and its half-time in these environments usually ranges from 1\r\nhour to several hours .Food chain bioconcentration and biomagnification are\r\nunlikely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide may be oxidized by oxygen (O2)\r\nand ozone (O3) to give sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ultimately sulfate compounds.\r\nSulfur dioxide and sulfates are eventually removed from the atmosphere through\r\nabsorption by plants, deposition on and sorption by soils, or through\r\nprecipitation. A residence time of approximately 1.7 days at an ozone\r\nconcentration of 0.05 mg/m3 has been calculated for hydrogen sulfide. The\r\neffective life-times for hydrogen sulfide based on summer daytime and yearly\r\naverage hydroxyl radical concentrations have been estimated to be 0.23 and 2.3\r\ndays, respectively, based a measured rate constant of 4.8x10-12 cm3/molecule\r\nsecond. Life-times in air ranging from approximately 1 day in the summer to 42\r\ndays in the winter have been estimated for hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide\r\nis not expected to be decomposed by direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation\r\nand the reaction with ozone is not expected to be a significant environmental\r\nfate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aqueous solution, hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid, exhibiting\r\ntwo acid dissociation constants. The first dissociation yields bisulfide ion\r\n(HS\u2013), and the second yields sulfide ion (S2\u2013), with pKa values for each of\r\nthese dissociations of 7.04 and 11.96, respectively. At a pH of 7.0, the ratio\r\nof the concentration of aqueous hydrogen sulfide to bisulfate ion is\r\napproximately 1-to-1. As the pH increases above 7.0, the ratio of the\r\nconcentration of bisulfide ion to aqueous hydrogen sulfide increases. At a pH\r\nof 8, the ratio of the concentration of bisulfide ion to the concentration of\r\naqueous hydrogen sulfide is approximately 10-to-1. The relative concentration\r\nof sulfide ion does not begin to increase until a pH of 11 is exceeded; only\r\nabove pH 12 will the concentration of sulfide ion become significant (&gt;50%).\r\nHydrogen sulfide oxidation by O2 readily occurs in surface waters. At 25 \u00b0C and\r\npH 8, half-times of 50 and 26 hours were reported for hydrogen sulfide in water\r\nand seawater, respectively. Above pH 8, however, the rate of oxidation was\r\nindependent of pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide in waste water may be controlled by addition of\r\noxidizing chemicals, which react to form less toxic byproducts. In warm, damp\r\nenvironments (such as manholes and gravity sewers), hydrogen sulfide may be\r\noxidized by autotrophic bacteria to sulfuric acid . Chemical oxidation of\r\nhydrogen sulfide dissolved in sewage water produces sulfur at pH 6\u20137, while\r\nsulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfates, and ultimately sulfate are formed at pHs of\r\n7\u20139.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrogen sulfide is one of the principal components in the natural\r\nsulfur cycle. Bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes (a fungus-like bacteria)\r\nrelease hydrogen sulfide during the decomposition of sulfur containing proteins\r\nand by the direct reduction of sulfate (SO42-). Hydrogen sulfide is also\r\nconsumed by bacteria found in soil and water that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nelemental sulfur. Photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize hydrogen sulfide to\r\nsulfur and sulfate in the presence of light and the absence of oxygen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of microorganisms have been found to degrade hydrogen\r\nsulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate. Among these are a heterotrophic\r\nbacterium of the genus\u00a0<i>Xanthomonas\u00a0</i>isolated from dimethyl\r\ndisulfide-acclimated peat, heterotrophic fungi, and a marine isopod. Soils may\r\nsorb considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the air, retaining most of\r\nit in the form of elemental sulfur.

Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Symptoms of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure may include profuse salivation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, giddiness, headache, vertigo, amnesia, palpitations, arrhythmia, weakness, muscle cramps, confusion, sudden collapse, unconsciousness and death due to respiratory paralysis (above 300 ppm). Inhalation of (H2S) at low concentrations causes headache, dizziness and upset stomach. Higher concentrations cause olfactory fatigue, irritation to the respiratory tract, excitement, confusion, and exposure for a prolonged period may cause bronchitis and pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Although hydrogen sulfide is extremely odourous, the \"rotten egg\" odour is not a reliable indicator for warning of exposure since odour fatigue readily occurs. Odour sensation is lost immediately at concentrations exceeding 200 ppm. Case reports suggest that toxic amounts can enter the body through a punctured ear drum, even while wearing some sorts of respiratory protection.</p> <p>\u00a0Hydrogen sulfide is primarily a respiratory toxin which inhibits the cytochrome-oxidase system and is probably more potent than hydrogen cyanide. The lifetime of hydrogen sulfide in oxygenated blood is short and sulfmethaemoglobin is rapidly detoxified by red blood cells and the liver. Most fatalities due to hydrogen sulfide intoxication occur at the scene of exposure and immediate supportive care is imperative. Ensure such contingencies are addressed as part of the site emergency plan and that operators or other employees who may become accidentally exposed, are made aware of the existence of such a plan.</p> <p>The highly irritant properties of ammonia vapour result as the gas dissolves in mucous fluids and forms irritant, even corrosive solutions.</p> <p>Inhalation of the ammonia fumes causes coughing, vomiting, reddening of lips, mouth, nose, throat and conjunctiva while higher concentrations can cause temporary blindness, restlessness, tightness in the chest, pulmonary oedema (lung damage), weak pulse and cyanosis.</p> <p>Inhalation of high concentrations of vapour may cause breathing difficulty, tightness in chest, pulmonary oedema and lung damage. Brief exposure to high concentrations &gt; 5000 ppm may cause death due to asphyxiation (suffocation) or fluid in the lungs.</p> <p>Prolonged or regular minor exposure to the vapour may cause persistent irritation of the eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract. Massive ammonia exposures may produce chronic airway hyperactivity and asthma with associated pulmonary function changes. The average nasal retention of ammonia by human subjects was found to be 83%.</p>",

Eye irritation may produce conjunctivitis, photophobia, pain, and at higher concentrations blurred vision and corneal blistering</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Mild irritation is produced on moist skin when vapour concentrations of ammonia exceed 10000 ppm. High vapour concentrations (&gt;30000 ppm) or direct contact with solutions produces severe pain, a stinging sensation, burns and vesiculation and possible brown stains. Extensive burning may be fatal. Vapour exposure may, rarely, produce urticaria.</p>",

Very large doses of ammonium salts may produce a drop in blood pressure, collapse, central nervous system disorders, spasms, narcosis, respiratory paralysis and haemolysis.</p> <p>Large doses of ammonium salts may be sufficiently absorbed to produce diuresis and systemic ammonia poisoning. Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Ingestion of sulfite salts may\r\ncause gastric irritation as a result of the liberation of sulfurous acid.

These symptoms may also result from damage produced by isolated or repeated unmeasured peak high level exposures in healthy persons or those suffering from pre-existing neurological diseases. A study on long term effects showed that H2S apparently can cause continuing, sometimes unrecognised olfactory deficits. [<i>Hirsch, A.R. - Occ. Env. Med.,1999, Vol 5, Iss 4, pp 284-287</i>]</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated minor exposure to ammonia gas/vapour may cause long-term irritation to the eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract. Repeated exposure or prolonged contact may produce dermatitis, and conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Other effects may include ulcerative changes to the mouth and bronchial and gastrointestinal disturbances. Adaptation to usually irritating concentrations may result in tolerance. In animals, repeated exposures to sub-lethal levels produces adverse effects on the respiratory tract, liver, kidneys and spleen. Exposure at 675 ppm for several weeks produced eye irritation in dogs and rabbits; corneal opacity, covering between a quarter to one half of the total surface area, was evident in rabbits.</p>",

This is supported by experimental data which confirm that absorption after oral exposure is low, averaging 2-7% in animals and 2-10% in humans. Faecal elimination of unabsorbed material predominates after ingestion (up to 90% of dose). Renal clearance of any material absorbed from the gut is rapid, with urinary half-lives of 5 hr and 70 hr reported. This second phase of excretion may represent mobilization of material. Initially sequestered by bone, since deposition studies have shown preferential accumulation of these substances in the epiphyseal plate and other regions of the long bones\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>. Around 25% of material absorbed following an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine, with the reminder converted to an N-methyl derivative or unidentified product(s). Inconsistent data indicate conversion to carbon dioxide is negligible. More pronounced accumulation is observed in bone after i.v. or i.p. injection, reflecting enhanced bioavailability following exposure by these non-physiological routes. Based on the available data, no major differences appear to exist between animals and humans with regard to the absorption, distribution and elimination of phosphonic acid compounds\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>ATMP acid and ATMP salts are poorly absorbed from the gut and rapidly eliminated after oral and i.v. administration. Faeces represent the principal route of excretion after oral administration with trace amounts present in urine and carcass. Faeces elimination was, in contrast, comparatively insignificant after i.v. injection, with the majority of the dose present either in urine or carcass. Bone is the only tissue that exhibits deposition of test-substance derived radioactivity. Absorption after dermal exposure was very low and only trace amounts were found in urine, faeces and carcass. The main route of excretion was via the urine in the first 24 hours following application.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Gastro-intestinal absorption of HEDP acid and HEDP salts is rat, dog, rabbit and monkey is low, with the majority of the dose excreted in faeces and a substantial amount excreted via the urine.

The\r\nphosphonic acid function is a strong acid, and it is frequently produced as a\r\nsalt for reasons of ease of use. It can form stable complexes with polyvalent\r\nmetal ions.\u00a0 As a consequence of the ionisation over typical pH ranges, it is\r\nof high water solubility (= 500 g/l) and low octanol-water partition coefficient\r\n(Log Kow = -3.53).\u00a0 Its vapour pressure is very low (1.9 x 10-10 Pa\r\n(estimated)). At pH 7, ATMP in water will be almost fully ionised four times,\r\nwith a majority of the molecules ionised five times.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There is a possibility that the emission of a phosphonic acid\r\ncould locally decrease the pH in the aquatic environment. In the normal use of\r\nthese substances, their pH, concentration and water quality have to be\r\nmonitored very carefully. Therefore, a significant decrease of the pH of the\r\nreceiving water is not expected. Furthermore, the substances are usually used\r\nas salts with near-neutral pH, and their effects on pH are further buffered by\r\nthe presence of metal ions. Generally the changes in pH of the receiving water\r\nshould stay within the natural range of the pH, and for this reason, adverse\r\neffects on the aquatic environment are not expected due to release of the\r\nphosphonic acids.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">ATMP and its salts may enter the environment via normal use in\r\nwater treatment applications. It is predicted and has been shown to be adsorbed\r\nby inorganic matrices (measured Koc = 11740), and therefore adsorption to\r\nsewage sludge and soil is strong. ATMP and its sodium salts are not readily or\r\ninherently biodegradable in laboratory studies carried out under standard conditions.\r\nAlthough these data suggest the potential for persistence, there is, however,\r\nevidence of partial degradation by abiotic processes in natural waters, and\r\nbiodegradation following acclimation, or under conditions of low inorganic\r\nphosphate. In the presence of commonly found metal ions possessing redox\r\nproperties, such as iron, metal-catalysed degradation and photodegradation can\r\nbe rapid, which promotes further biodegradation.\u00a0 ATMP is not bioaccumulative\r\n(measured BCF &lt;25).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As complexing agents, these substances could remobilise metals in\r\nthe environment; however, their high degree of adsorption to sediments suggests\r\nthat this is unlikely to occur.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Not harmful to aquatic organisms (short term and long term\r\nexposure)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">ATMP and its salts possess properties indicating a hazard for the\r\nenvironment (EC50 in the range 10 \u2013 100 mg/l for algae).

A sub-lethal test\r\nwith the oyster, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>, yielded a 96-hour EC50 for\r\neffects on shell growth of 201 mg/l and a chronic test with Daphnia magna\r\nyielded a 28-day NOEC of &gt;25 mg/l, suggesting that ATMP has low chronic\r\ntoxicity to aquatic invertebrates. A further chronic study in <i>Daphnia magna</i>\r\nof unassignable validity (Klimisch code 4) gave a 21-day NOEC of 3.0 mg/l and\r\nLOEC of 10 mg/l (based on nominal concentrations).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">ATMP is of low acute toxicity to the marine sediment living\r\namphipod <i>Corophium volutator</i> (10-day LC50 &gt;5000 mg/kg dw) and to\r\nsewage sludge micro-organisms (<i>Pseudomonas putida</i> 30-min EC0 &gt;=500\r\nmg/l).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The effects of ATMP observed in tests with algae are likely to be\r\na consequence of nutrient limitation caused by complexation and not true\r\ntoxicity.

Thus\r\norganisms preferentially use inorganic phosphate, which may explain the low\r\nbiodegradability of phosphonates in synthetic test media and natural sewage\r\nsystems.The classical tests, such as the OECD screening test, BOD20 test or the\r\nclosed bottle test show only a low degree of ultimate biodegradation of\r\nphosphonate derivatives. For ATMP and HEDP a DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon)\r\nremoval of 23 - 33 % was observed in an inherent biodegradability test\r\n(Zahn-Wellens test), but mineralisation was very low even after long-term\r\nincubation. However, several studies have shown that phosphonate degrading\r\nbacteria can be found in almost any environment whether soil, activated sludge\r\nor river water. At low ortho-phosphate concentration, i.e. if phosphate is the\r\ngrowth-limiting factor, phosphonate degradation occurs with almost complete\r\nbreakdown of HEDP (94 %). DTPMP showed 60 % degradation under similar\r\nconditions. No quantitative study was done for ATMP. These phosphate-limited\r\nconditions are not likely to occur in most environments. Inherent\r\nbiodegradation tests (Zahn-Wellens, SCAS testing) also indicate a low degree of\r\nbiodegradation under the standard test conditions. For example, biodegradation\r\nof radiolabelled ATMP, HEDP and DTPMP resulted in SCAS tests in 0.5 to 10.2 %\r\nrelease of 14CO2 over a 210 day period. As a consequence,it is assumed that\r\nbiodegradation does not occur in sewage treatment plants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Degradation does occur in the presence of river sediment; however\r\nstudies indicate that phosphonates become tightly bound onto the sediment, for\r\na significant part irreversibly. This leads to the conclusion that the major\r\npart of the (bio)degradation may occur in the sediment but not in the water\r\nphase. Half-lives for this degradation were calculated, assuming an exponential\r\ndecay, from the average measured values, i.e. for ATMP 8.8% in 50 days, for\r\nHEDP 7.1 % in 50 days and for DTPMP 15.9% in 50 days and 29.6 % in 38 days. The\r\ncorresponding half-lives are 376 days for ATMP, 471 days for HEDP and 200 days\r\nand 75 days for DTPMP. For the latter a half-life of 137.5 days was used in the\r\nassessment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Anaerobic degradation has not been studied extensively. It has\r\nbeen reported only minor conversion of ATMP and HEDP occurs in model digestors.\r\nNo inhibitory effect was observed neither for ATMP up to 100 mg/liter and for\r\nHEDP up to 5 mg/g dry sludge.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In soils, biodegradation of DTPMP has been shown. ATMP and HEDP\r\nalso show degradation, but slower than DTPMP. When sludges or sediments are\r\ndisposed of at land, this will ensure mineralisation and removal from the\r\nenvironment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrolysis:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Phosphonates are quite\r\nstable in water as evidenced by the dark controls in the photolysis studies.\r\nHowever it was found that ATMP would hydrolyse fairly easily at low\r\nconcentrations (70 ppb) with complete primary degradation in a few days.\r\nAnother study reported 37 % degradation of HEDP in the presence of copper ions.\r\nYet another study on the hydrolysis of phosphonates came to the conclusion that\r\nmetal ions, aerobic conditions and light were favourable conditions of the\r\nhydrolysis/degradation of these substances. \u00a0Although hydrolytic\r\ndegradation mechanisms have been identified, they appear to be strongly\r\ndependent on the specific environmental conditions, and in particular on the\r\npresences of certain metal ions and light. Hydrolysis half-lifes in the range\r\nof 50 -200 days at 15 ? 25 \u00b0C have been calculated. \u00a0In colder\r\nenvironments the half-life for hydrolysis might be of the same order as biodegradation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Photodegradation:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Photodegradation\r\nis another important route of the environmental removal of phosphonates. It is\r\ncatalysed by transition metal ions and is pH dependent. \u00a0It is especially\r\npronounced in the presence of iron ions when 40 to 90 % degradation of the\r\nphosphonate-residues to ortho-phosphate occurs in 17 days. Other transition\r\nmetals also stimulate photodegradation, in particular for HEDP. Further studies\r\non HEDP confirmed these findings. HEDP was found to be degradable in river waters\r\nat neutral pH simulating day-light conditions. The rate of degradation was\r\nconcentration dependent. At 3 mg/l, 70% was degraded in 8 days, at 10 mg/l,\r\nonly 12.5 % was degraded. The half life was estimated at about. 100 hrs at 3\r\nmg/l.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">As\r\nexpected for highly water-soluble substances, the log Kow values for\r\nphosphonates are low (ATMP: -3.53; HEDP: -3.49; EDTMP: -4.10; HDTMP: -4.43;\r\nDTMP: -3.40). The potential for bioaccumulation of phosphonates in aquatic\r\norganisms is therefore expected to be low as well. Experimental\r\nbioconcentration studies with zebra fish have been conducted with radiolabelled\r\nATMP and HEDP. For both substances, the BCF values determined after 4-6 weeks\r\nof exposure were less than 24.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Metal remobilisation:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Metal\r\nremobilisation is the re-dissolution of metals such as zinc, copper, chromium,\r\ncadmium, mercury etc., which are precipitated in river and lake sediments. This\r\ncould lead to several problems: increased exposure of water life to these\r\nmetals at toxic levels, and passing through of the metal to drinking water\r\nabstracted from surface water. It has been suggested that the increased metal\r\nconcentrations may stimulate algal growth, leading to algae blooms in summer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Studies have shown that phosphonates only remobilise metals at\r\nconcentrations of at least 100 to 300 ppb. This is well above the predicted\r\nenvironmental concentration of less than 1 ppb. Even at concentrations\r\nestimated for a worst case situation of 10 to 30 ppb, no metal remobilisation\r\nis expected.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Chelating agents can inhibit algae growth, due to complexation of\r\nessential nutrients. The 96 hours EC50 values for the species Selanastrum range\r\nfrom 0.45 mg/L for DTPMP up to 12 mg/L for ATMP. Very large differences have\r\nbeen observed between species. In an 8-day study the effect concentration\r\n(EC50) for Chlorella was well above 10 mg/l for all phosphonates. With many\r\nchelating agents, algal growth inhibition results may be strongly affected by\r\nchelation of trace metal nutrients. This is often interpreted incorrectly as a\r\ntoxic effect on algae, whereas the real cause is nutrient limitation. It may\r\nalso induce a high degree of variability between test labs and individual\r\ntests, due to variations in the organisms tested and small variations in the\r\ntest medium composition</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Tests on invertebrates (Chironomus, Daphnia, Grass shrimp) show\r\nlow toxicity.

Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high vapour concentrations may be chest and nasal irritation with coughing, sneezing, headache and even nausea.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Irritation of the eyes may produce a heavy secretion of tears (lachrymation).</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The observed eye irritation potential of the phosphonic acid compounds ATMP, HEDP, DTPMP and their salts, ranged from practically non-irritating to severely irritating with irreversible effects.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>ATMP acid tested as neat product was considered to be moderately irritating to rabbit eyes, whereas the tetra- and pentasodium salt which were tested in aqueous solutions containing around 40 % active salt were found to be practically non-irritating. These products were evaluated without immediate rinsing the eye following application. All test animals were free of symptoms by the end of the observation period.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>HEDP acid was tested as a formulation containing 60 % active acid and minimal amounts of HCl with and without rinsing immediately after application. In the study without rinsing, the formulation caused severe irritation and persistent effects. Rinsing the eye directly after application, lessened the severity of the response and all effects disappeared by the end of the observations. The HEDP salts were less irritating to the rabbit eyes in studies with pure salts and formulations thereof tested without rinsing. The tetrasodium salt (<i>i.e.</i>, tested as solution containing up to 30 % active salt) was only minimally irritating to the rabbits eyes.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In general the same trend as was found with skin irritation was found for eye irritation. The acid compounds were more irritating then tested salts and duration of exposure (<i>i.e</i>., as mimicked by rinsing/non-rinsing immediately after product installation) increased the observed symptoms.\u00a0</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to produce harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives using animal models). Systemic harm, however, has been identified following exposure of animals by at least one other route and the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The acids and salts of ATMP, HEDP, and DTPMP can be considered to be of low acute dermal toxicity. ATMP acid and its tetra- and pentasodium salt were practically non-toxic with LD50 values exceeding the concentrations tested. Dermal LD50 values were determined to be greater than 6310 mg active acid/kg bw. No dermal toxicity was observed for HEDP acid and its salts at the highest tested concentrations tested of 1650 mg active salt/kg bw. DTPMP compounds\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On the basis of the studies phosphonic acid chelatants and their salts, can generally be considered to be mildly irritating to skin at most. In one study a more severe reaction was observed, when an aqueous solution containing 25 % of ATMP acid was applied to intact rabbit skin for 4 hours under occluded conditions. The same result was obtained when an aqueous solution containing 33 % active tetrasodium salt of HEDP was applied to rabbit skin for 24 hours under occlusive dressing The longer application time of 24 h caused more irritation then when the acid or salt product was only applied over 4 h where no irritation response was observed in most cases regardless of the strength of the product tested. Applying the neat acid or salt did not seem to produce a consistently greater effect, rather in some cases the neat powder product was less irritating than some tested formulations, indicating reduced potential of the applied powder product for skin reactivity.\u00a0</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>The phosphonic acid compounds ATMP, HEDP, DTPMP and their salts can be considered to be of low to moderate acute oral toxicity. ATMP acid was of moderate acute toxicity to mammals. The acute oral LD50 in rat was determined to be 2910 mg active acid/kg bw. In comparison, the tetrasodium and pentasodium salt of ATMP were less acutely toxic with LD50 values of 8610 and 7120 mg active salt/kg bw, respectively. HEDP acid and its salts are of moderate acute oral toxicity LD50's in rats and mice ranging from 1100 to 1878 mg active acid/kg bw. The oral LD50 values of HEDP salts were in a slightly wider range from 581 mg active salt/kg bw to greater than 5000 mg active salt/kg. DTPMP acid and salts are of low toxicity with oral LD50 values from 3870 mg active salt/kg bw to less than 8757 mg active salt/kg bw.\u00a0</p> <p>In pharmacology bisphosphonates (also called diphosphonates) \u00a0are a class of drugs that inhibit \u00a0osteoclast action and resorption of bone; they are used for \u00a0the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. osteitis deformans (Paget's disease of the bone), bone metastasis (with or without hypercalcaemia), multiple myeloma and other conditions that feature bone fragility.</p> <p>The association between bisphosphonates and severe musculoskeletal pain may be overlooked by healthcare professionals, delaying diagnosis, prolonging pain and/or impairment, and necessitating the use of analgesics. The severe musculoskeletal pain may occur within days, months, or years after starting a bisphosphonates. Some patients have reported complete relief of symptoms after discontinuing the bisphosphonate, whereas others have reported slow or incomplete resolution. The risk factors for and incidence of severe musculoskeletal pain associated with bisphosphonates are unknown.\u00a0</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Long term exposure to organophosphonate chelating agents may cause adverse effects.</p> <p>Rats fed on aminotri(methylenephosphonic acid) (ATMP), for up to 24 months, exhibited reduced body weight and changes in liver, spleen and kidney weights. No adverse histologic. haematologic, biochemical or urinological effects were seen. The \"no-effect\" level was 150 mg/kg/day. No significant teratogenic or foetotoxic effects were observed in the off-spring of rats and mice exposed to the neutral sodium salt, by gavage. No maternal toxicity was observed at any level. No adverse treatment related effects or reproductive parameters and no pathological or histopathological lesions were observed in either parental animals or pups following dietary exposure of the solid active acid at various times in the mating and birth cycle for three generations.</p> <p>Rats fed on ethylenediamine(methylenephosphonic acid (EDTMP) (300 mg/kg daily for 10 weeks) before mating and up to the end of the mating period, showed reduced body weights, defects in dental enamel on the incisors and significantly reduced liver weights. In an ongoing study, several rats treated with EDTMP (50-333 mg/kg/day) died during the first twelve months and were seen to have osteosarcomas with metastases. Other adverse effects of EDTMP treatment included increased white blood cell counts in mice, anaemia and reduction in erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum cholesterol, total serum protein and globulin, in rats.</p> <p>In a one-generation reproductive study the off-spring of rats, fed up to 3000 ppm DTPMPA (diethylenetriaminepentakis(methylenephosphonic acid)), showed no adverse effects although there was a slight decrease in birth weights.</p>",
