Viscosity @ 30 deg, C: 75% (7 cP); 81.5% (25 cP); 85% (32 cP). Dissociation constants @ 25 deg C: Step 1  7.52 x 10e-3 (2.12 pH); Step 2 6.23 x 10e-8 (7.21pH); Step 3 2.2 x 10e-13 (12.67pH) High concentrations may crystallize in cold weather. Acid at 100% is in the form of crystals.  Mixes with water and alcohol.|Pure anhydrous phosphoric acid (syn: orthophosphoric acid, phosphoric(V) acid) is a white solid that melts at 42.35 \u00b0C to form a colorless, viscous liquid.|Most people and even chemists refer to orthophosphoric acid as phosphoric acid, which is the IUPAC name for this compound. The prefix ortho is used to distinguish the acid from other phosphoric acids, called polyphosphoric acids. Orthophosphoric acid is a non-toxic, inorganic, rather weak triprotic acid, which, when pure, is a solid at room temperature and pressure.  Orthophosphoric acid is a very polar molecule; therefore it is highly soluble in water. The oxidation state of phosphorus (P) in ortho- and other phosphoric acids is +5; the oxidation state of all the oxygen atoms (O) is -2 and all the hydrogen atoms (H) is +1. Triprotic means that an orthophosphoric acid molecule can dissociate up to three times, giving up an H+ each time, which typically combines with a water molecule, H2O",

Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment. The growth of algae produces undesirable effects on the treatment of water for drinking purposes, on fisheries, and on the use of lakes for recreational purposes.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Phosphates are slowly and incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are unlikely (other than in abuse) to produce the systemic effects which occur when introduced by other routes. Such effects include vomiting, lethargy, fever, diarrhoea, falls in blood pressure, slow pulse, cyanosis, carpal spasm, coma and tetany. These effects result following sequestration of blood calcium.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Ingestion of large amounts of phosphate salts (over 1 gm for an adult) may produce osmotic catharsis resulting in diarrhoea and probably, abdominal cramp. Large doses (4-8 gm) will almost certainly produce these effects in most individuals. Most of the ingested salt will be excreted in the faeces of healthy individuals without producing systemic toxicity. Doses in excess of 10 gm may produce systemic toxicity.</p> <p>Ingestion of large quantity of phosphoric acid may cause severe abdominal pains, thirst, acidaemia, difficult breathing, convulsions, collapse, shock and death.</p> <p>Although less hazardous than nitric and sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid has equal corrosive action upon ingestion.

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

The iron chelates thus formed serve to chelate other heavy metals or alkaline earths.|[~Intermediate ~]|<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA, HEEDTA,\r\n[N-[2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycinato(3-)],\r\nN-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid) is a chelating agent with\r\nsimilar properties to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).</span></p> <p><span>A chelating agent:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Chelation is useful in applications such as\r\nwater softening, providing nutritional supplements, in chelation therapy to\r\nremove toxic metals from the body, as contrast agents in MRI scanning, in\r\nmanufacturing using homogeneous catalysts, and in fertilizers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Chelation is a type of bonding of ions and\r\nmolecules to metal ions. It involves the formation or presence of two or more\r\nseparate coordinate bonds between a polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand and a\r\nsingle central atom.. Usually these ligands are organic compounds, and are\r\ncalled chelants, chelators, chelating agents, or sequestering agents.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is an aminopolycarboxylic\r\nacid. Its conjugate base is ethylenediaminetetraacetate. It is widely used as a\r\nsequestering agent. Its usefulness arises because of its role as a hexadentate\r\n(\"six-toothed\") ligand and chelating agent, i.e., its ability to\r\nsequester metal ions such as Ca2+ and Fe3+. After being bound by EDTA into a\r\nmetal complex, metal ions remain in solution but exhibit diminished reactivity.\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In shampoos, cleaners, and other personal care products, EDTA\r\nsalts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the laboratory, EDTA is widely used for scavenging metal ions:\r\nIn biochemistry and molecular biology, ion depletion is commonly used to\r\ndeactivate metal-dependent enzymes, either as an assay for their reactivity or\r\nto suppress damage to DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides. EDTA also acts as a\r\nselective inhibitor against dNTP hydrolyzing enzymes (Taq polymerase, dUTPase,\r\nMutT), liver arginase and horseradish peroxidase independently of metal ion\r\nchelation. These findings urge the rethinking of the utilization of EDTA as a\r\nbiochemically inactive metal ion scavenger in enzymatic experiments. In\r\nanalytical chemistry, EDTA is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of\r\nwater hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would\r\ninterfere with the analyses. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">EDTA finds many specialized uses in the biomedical labs, such as\r\nin veterinary ophthalmology as an anticollagenase to prevent the worsening of\r\ncorneal ulcers in animals. In tissue culture EDTA is used as a chelating agent\r\nthat binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells,\r\npreventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension, or detaching adherent\r\ncells for passaging. In histopathology, EDTA can be used as a decalcifying\r\nagent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue\r\nsample is demineralised. EDTA is also known to inhibit a range of\r\nmetallopeptidases, the method of inhibition occurs via the chelation of the\r\nmetal ion required for catalytic activity. EDTA can also be used to test for\r\nbioavailability of heavy metals in sediments. However, it may influence the\r\nbioavailability of metals in solution, which may pose concerns regarding its\r\neffects in the environment, especially given its widespread uses and\r\napplications. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In industry, EDTA is mainly used to sequester metal ions in\r\naqueous solution. In the textile industry, it prevents metal ion impurities\r\nfrom modifying colours of dyed products. In the pulp and paper industry, EDTA\r\ninhibits the ability of metal ions, especially Mn2+, from catalyzing the\r\ndisproportionation of hydrogen peroxide, which is used in chlorine-free\r\nbleaching. In a similar manner, EDTA is added to some food as a preservative or\r\nstabilizer to prevent catalytic oxidative decoloration, which is catalyzed by\r\nmetal ions. In soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate, EDTA\r\nmitigates formation of benzene (a carcinogen).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The reduction of water hardness in laundry applications and the\r\ndissolution of scale in boilers both rely on EDTA and related complexants to\r\nbind Ca2+, Mg2+, as well as other metal ions. Once bound to EDTA, these metal\r\ncenters tend not to form precipitates or to interfere with the action of the\r\nsoaps and detergents. For similar reasons, cleaning solutions often contain\r\nEDTA. In a similar manner EDTA is used in the cement industry for the\r\ndetermination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinker.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">EDTA serves as a preservative (usually to enhance the action of\r\nanother preservative such as benzalkonium chloride or thiomersal) in ocular\r\npreparations and eye drops. EDTA is used extensively in the analysis of blood.\r\nIt is an anticoagulant for blood samples for CBC/FBEs, where the EDTA chelates\r\nthe calcium present in the blood specimen, arresting the coagulation process\r\nand preserving blood cell morphology.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Some alternative practitioners believe EDTA acts as an\r\nantioxidant, preventing free radicals from injuring blood vessel walls,\r\ntherefore reducing atherosclerosis.. These ideas are unsupported by scientific\r\nstudies, and seem to contradict some currently accepted principles. The U.S.\r\nFDA has not approved it for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The solubilization of Fe3+ ions at or below near neutral pH can be\r\naccomplished using EDTA. This property is useful in agriculture including\r\nhydroponics. However, given the pH dependence of ligand formation, EDTA is not\r\nhelpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils. Otherwise, at\r\nnear-neutral pH and above, iron(III) forms insoluble salts, which are less\r\nbioavailable to susceptible plant species. Aqueous [Fe(EDTA)]- is used for removing\r\n(\"scrubbing\") hydrogen sulfide from gas streams.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">EDTA was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by\r\nion-exchange chromatography. The method relies on the steady increase in\r\nstability constant of the lanthanide EDTA complexes with atomic number. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A specific salt of EDTA, known as sodium calcium edetate, is used\r\nto bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy, such as for treating\r\nmercury and lead poisoning. It is used in a similar manner to remove excess\r\niron from the body. This therapy is used to treat the complication of repeated\r\nblood transfusions, as would be applied to treat thalassaemia.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Dentists and endodontists use EDTA solutions to remove inorganic\r\ndebris (smear layer) and lubricate the root canals in endodontics. This\r\nprocedure helps prepare root canals for obturation. Furthermore, EDTA solutions\r\nwith the addition of a surfactant loosen up calcifications inside a root canal\r\nand allow instrumentation (canal shaping) and facilitate apical advancement of\r\na file in a tight or calcified root canal towards the apex.</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Chelating effects of NTA carry body zinc into the kidney ultrafiltrate where it is reabsorbed by the cells of the tubular epithelium. Zinc is toxic to these cells producing cell injury and death leading to hyperplastic and eventually neoplastic responses.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <ul> <li>Local exhaust ventilation is required where solids are handled as powders or crystals; even when particulates are relatively large, a certain proportion will be powdered by mutual friction.\u00a0</li> <li>Exhaust ventilation should be designed to prevent accumulation and recirculation of particulates in the workplace.\u00a0</li> <li>If in spite of local exhaust an adverse concentration of the substance in air could occur, respiratory protection should be considered.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",
