It is often used as its sodium salt,\r\nsodium carboxymethyl cellulose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC is used in food under the E\r\nnumber E466 or E469 (when it is enzymatically hydrolyzed) as a viscosity\r\nmodifier or thickener, and to stabilize emulsions in various products including\r\nice cream. It is also a constituent of many non-food products, such as\r\ntoothpaste, laxatives, diet pills, water-based paints, detergents, textile\r\nsizing, reusable heat packs, and various paper products. It is used primarily\r\nbecause it has high viscosity, is nontoxic, and is generally considered to be\r\nhypoallergenic as the major source fiber is either softwood pulp or cotton\r\nlinter.CMC is used extensively in gluten free and reduced fat food products .\r\nCMC powder is widely used in the ice cream industry, to make ice creams without\r\nchurning or extreme low temperatures, thereby eliminating the need for the\r\nconventional churners or salt ice mixes. CMC is used in preparing bakery\r\nproducts such as bread and cake aa an emulsifier in high quality biscuits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In laundry detergents, it is used\r\nas a soil suspension polymer designed to deposit onto cotton and other\r\ncellulosic fabrics, creating a negatively charged barrier to soils in the wash\r\nsolution. CMC is used as a lubricant in artificial tears.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Carboxymethylcellulose is also\r\nused as a thickening agent, for example, in the oil-drilling industry as an\r\ningredient of drilling mud, where it acts as a viscosity modifier and water\r\nretention agent. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC is used as a thickening and\r\nsuspending agent. Pharmaceutical grades available. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC is a protective colloid and\r\nstabiliser for vinyl and acrylic polymerisation. As an ingredient of concrete\r\ncuring compounds, it retards evaporation of water in cements, mortars and\r\nconcrete; binder in ceramic glazes. CMC is used\u00a0 in films and sheeting; paper\r\nand textile sizing and insecondary petroleum recovery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sodium CMC(Na CMC) for example,\r\nis used as a negative control agent for alopecia in rabbits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Knitted fabric made of cellulose\r\n(e.g. cotton or viscose rayon) may be converted into CMC and used in various\r\nmedical applications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Insoluble microgranular CMC is\r\nused as a cation-exchange resin in ion-exchange chromatography for purification\r\nof proteins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC is also used in ice packs to\r\nform a eutectic mixture resulting in a lower freezing point, and therefore more\r\ncooling capacity than ice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aqueous solutions of CMC have\r\nalso been used to disperse carbon nanotubes. The long CMC molecules are thought\r\nto wrap around the nanotubes, allowing them to be dispersed in water. In\r\nconservation-restoration, it is used as an adhesive or fixative.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC is used to achieve tartrate\r\nor cold stability in wine. This innovation may save megawatts of electricity\r\nused to chill wine in warm climates. It is more stable than metatartaric acid\r\nand is very effective in inhibiting tartrate precipitation. It is reported that\r\npotassium bitartrate crystals, in presence of CMC, grow slower and change their\r\nmorphology.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In veterinary medicine, CMC is\r\nused in abdominal surgeries in large animals, particularly horses, to prevent\r\nthe formation of bowel adhesions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC is used as an electrode\r\nbinder in advanced battery applications (i.e. lithium ion batteries),\r\nespecially with graphite anodes. CMC's water solubility allows for less toxic\r\nand costly processing than with non-water-soluble binders, like the traditional\r\npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which requires toxic n-methylpyrrolidone (NMP)\r\nfor processing. CMC is often used in conjunction with styrene-butadiene rubber\r\n(SBR) for electrodes requiring extra flexibility, e.g. for use with\r\nsilicon-containing anode</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">CMC has also been used\r\nextensively to characterize enzyme activity from endoglucanases (part of the\r\ncellulase complex). CMC is a highly specific substrate for endo-acting\r\ncellulases, as its structure has been engineered to decrystallize cellulose and\r\ncreate amorphous sites that are ideal for endoglucanase action.</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Byssinosis is a chronic,\r\nasthma-like narrowing of the airways. Also called brown lung disease,\r\nbyssinosis occurs almost exclusively in people who work with unprocessed cotton</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Cotton dust disease,\r\n\"byssinosis\", is well known among cotton mill workers. Cotton dust\r\nconsists largely of cellulose fibre. Exposure to two components of the total\r\ndust, the \"respirable\" and \"medium\" fraction correlated\r\nsignificantly with the prevalence of respiratory symptoms. Inhalation exposure\r\nto a concentration of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/m3 of \"fly-free\" dust results in\r\na 20% occurrence of byssinosis. \"Fly-free\" dust is the sum of\r\nrespirable and medium-length fibres. At 0.46 mg/m3, Grade II byssinosis occurs.\r\nA byssinosis (all grades) prevalence of 20%, at 0.3 mg/m3 occurs when the fibre\r\nlength is less than 15 um (aerodynamic equivalent diameter). Byssinosis is not\r\ncaused by mechanical irritation but by reactions caused by pharmacologically\r\nactive substances producing oedema or contraction of the smooth musculature of\r\nthe airways. The causative agent is suspected to be an endotoxin, in turn,\r\nthought to be a cell wall component of bacteria found in cotton. Symptoms of\r\nbyssinosis include chest tightness, wheezing and dyspnoea. Symptoms usually\r\nappear after an absence from work and may subside after 2-days of exposure. As\r\nthe disease progresses, symptoms may persist for longer periods until they are\r\nconstant. The individual may eventually exhibit chronic bronchitis and\r\nemphysema. Increased physical exertion may produce shortness of breath.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Studies indicate that diets\r\ncontaining large amounts of non-absorbable polysaccharides, such as cellulose,\r\nmight decrease absorption of calcium, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polysaccharides are polymeric\r\ncarbohydrates that consist of monosaccharide units, which are connected\r\ntogether with glycosidic bonds. Due to the structural variation of different\r\nmonosaccharides as well as the innumerable ways that these building blocks link\r\nwith each other, polysaccharides can be considered as structurally complex\r\nbiomacromolecules. Polysaccharides originating from plants (e.g., starch and\r\nguar gum), microbes (e.g., xanthan), algae (e.g., alginates and carrageenans)\r\nand animals (e.g., glycogen and chitin) are frequently used in food. Starch, a\r\nhigh molar mass compound consisting of (1-&gt;4)-linked alpha-D-glucopyranosyl\r\nunits, is an important energy nutrient that is abundant in common foods, such\r\nas cereals and root crops. Although many other food polysaccharides are not\r\ndigested in the upper gastrointestinal tract of humans, they often serve\r\nfunctions other than being components giving nutritional value. For example,\r\nplant cell-wall polysaccharides, such as arabinoxylans and beta-glucan, exist\r\nin cereal-based foods, and \u201cplant gums\u201d are used as thickeners, emulsifiers,\r\nemulsion stabilizers, gelling agents and encapsulating agents. These\r\nnon-digestible polysaccharides are important for health because they are\r\nconsidered as dietary fibre, which promote colon health, regulate post-prandial\r\nblood glucose levels and reduce serum cholesterol levels.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Despite the fact that nature\r\nprovides various sources of polysaccharides, and that scientific research on\r\ntheir exploitation as food materials is increasingly active, a relatively low\r\nnumber of polysaccharides are authorized for use as food ingredients. For\r\nexample, in the European Union (EU) and in Switzerland, among the permitted\r\nfood additives (identified by an E number) only a small percentage are\r\npolysaccharide-based (native or structurally modified). The difference between\r\nother food ingredients and food additives is mainly the quantity used in any\r\ngiven product. Food ingredients can be consumed alone as food (e.g., starch),\r\nwhereas food additives (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose) are used in small\r\nquantities (usually less than 2%) relative to the total food composition but\r\nthey, nonetheless, play an important role in the food products. Regarding food\r\nadditive use in Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has an expert\r\nPanel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food (ANS), which\r\nevaluates the safety of food additives. Similarly, if new ingredients are\r\nreleased into the market, EFSA's Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and\r\nAllergies (NDA) has the responsibility of evaluating the safety of Novel Food\r\ningredients</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The vast majority of\r\npolysaccharides used as food ingredients are plant-based. In addition to the\r\ncellulosic polysaccharides, other types of food-grade ingredients or additives,\r\nsuch as, vanillin aroma, glycerol esters of wood rosins (E445), xylitol (E967)\r\nand steryls/stanols, are derived from wood. The main components of wood are\r\npolysaccharides: cellulose (40\u201350 wt%) and hemicelluloses (20\u201335%), while\r\nlignin comprises 15\u201330% of wood mass.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The material contains a substantial\r\nproportion of a polymer considered to be of low concern (PLC).
