Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness.

This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Vomitus frequently contains blood, due in part to capillary dilation and blood loss through gastrointestinal walls (diapedesis). Watery diarrhoea with ribbons of bowel mucosa contribute to cardiovascular collapse from fluid and electrolyte loss. Although a quiescent period may follow some victims relapse within 12 hours into lethal secondary shock. During relapse a profound metabolic acidosis is encountered. This has been attributed to hydrolysis of ferric ions in blood as well as increases in the level of lactic and citric acids. Respiratory changes resulting from acidosis are often evident. Postmortem examination often reveals liver damage consisting of periportal haemorrhagic necrosis. Poisoning may also produce a metallic taste, restlessness, lethargy, hypotonia, coma, pallor or cyanosis, fast, weak pulse, hypotension, hyperventilation (due to acidosis), shock, vasomotor instability and cardiovascular collapse. Pneumonitis, pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage, convulsions, liver impairment with jaundice, hypoglycaemia, multiple coagulation defects, kidney damage with anuria, pancreatic damage, vascular damage, hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, profound shock and vascular collapse have been reported. Survivors may display gastric scarring or obstruction, pyloric obstruction or stenosis, mild hepatic scirrhosis or neuralgic sequelae.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Overexposure to respirable dust may cause coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and impaired lung function. Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p>Chronic excessive iron exposure has been associated with haemosiderosis and consequent possible damage to the liver and pancreas. Haemosiderin is a golden-brown insoluble protein produced by phagocytic digestion of haematin (an iron-based pigment). Haemosiderin is found in most tissues, especially in the liver, in the form of granules. Other sites of haemosiderin deposition include the pancreas and skin. A related condition, haemochromatosis, which involves a disorder of metabolism of these deposits, may produce cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, and bronze pigmentation of the skin - heart failure may eventually occur.</p> <p>\u00a0Such exposure may also produce conjunctivitis, choroiditis, retinitis (both inflammatory conditions involving the eye) and siderosis of tissues if iron remains in these tissues. Siderosis is a form of pneumoconiosis produced by iron dusts. Siderosis also includes discoloration of organs, excess circulating iron and degeneration of the retina, lens and uvea as a result of the deposition of intraocular iron. Siderosis might also involve the lungs - involvement rarely develops before ten years of regular exposure. Often there is an accompanying inflammatory reaction of the bronchi. Permanent scarring of the lungs does not normally occur.</p> <p>\u00a0High levels of iron may raise the risk of cancer. This concern stems from the theory that iron causes oxidative damage to tissues and organs by generating highly reactive chemicals, called free radicals, which subsequently react with DNA. Cells may be disrupted and may be become cancerous. People whose genetic disposition prevents them from keeping tight control over iron (e.g. those with the inherited disorder, haemochromatosis) may be at increased risk.</p> <p>Iron overload in men may lead to diabetes, arthritis, liver cancer, heart irregularities and problems with other organs as iron builds up.</p> <p>\u00a0[K.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis. The material did not appear to be absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantity to produce outward signs of toxicity.</p>",

The CVD process has found use in the following applications:\nProduction of semiconductor devices \nSynthesis of exotic new powdered/fibrous materials \nFabrication of optical storage media \nProduction of protective coatings, including high temperature-, corrosion-, and wear-resistance coatings \nFormation of ceramic composites, optical fibers and dense structural components. \nThere are a number of CVD forms that include low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD), atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (ACVD), ultrahigh vacuum vapour deposition (UHCVD) and metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). In the case of MOCVD, metal organic species are used as precursors to form thin films of metal oxides, metals, metal nitrides and other kinds of metallic compounds. \nThe ALD process is more popular due to its ability to provide even greater control over the formation of thin films. The unique process has found use in the following applications:\nProduction of new high-k gate dielectrics that hold potential to serve as an alternative to silica in next generation of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors \nDevelopment of electroluminescent device technology \nFabrication of microelectronic devices, including thin-film capacitors, radiation detectors, switches, ferroelectric memories, integrated circuits, and microelectromechanical structures (MEMS). \nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) is a chemically self-limiting deposition technique that is based on the sequential use of a gaseous chemical process. A thin film (as fine as -0.1 Angstrom per cycle) results from repeating the deposition sequence as many times as needed to reach a certain thickness. The major characteristic of the films is the resulting conformality and the controlled deposition manner. Precursor selection is key in ALD processes, namely finding molecules which will have enough reactivity to produce the desired films yet are stable enough to be handled and safely delivered to the reaction chamber.\nProper precursors show promise to develop customised systems for lower-temperature deposition processes, thus preventing the complications related to higher temperatures, including reduced adhesion of mismatching overlayers, interlayer atomic diffusion, and changes in the morphology and crystallinity. Furthermore, they can get rid of halogens, which can be corrosive in the deposition process and even after the formation of the film.\nInitially, metal halides and hydrides were utilised as CVD precursors. Currently, many different metal organic compounds are used as precursors, which include metal carbonyls, metal amidinates, metal diketonates, metal alkoxides, metal alkyls and others.\nMetal Alkoxide Precursors\nMetal alkoxides of copper, silicon, tantalum, vanadium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, and aluminum have been explored as precursors to form oxide thin films using CVD/ALD.\nIn the fabrication of metal oxide thin films utilizing CVD/ALD, a metal organic compound often reacts with H2O2, O3, O2 plasma, or water as the oxygen source. Nonetheless, this approach often involves the formation of interfacial oxide layers between the substrate and the deposited film. On the other hand, in the approach that involves the reaction between metal alkoxides and other metal complexes such as metal chlorides or metal alkyls, the metal alkoxides can serve as the oxygen source as well as the metal. This alternative approach reduces the formation of an undesired interfacial layer as the oxygen is bound to the metal.\nMetal Alkyl Amide Precursors\nMetal alkyl amide precursors include simple amino compounds such as dimethyl- and diethyl- amine and include a large class of compounds but their use in ALD/CVD has been restricted because of their thermal instability.Alkylamides include antimony, aluminium, gallium, germanium, hafnium, niobium, silicon, tantalum, tin, titanium, tungsten, zirconium and yttrium complexes.\nMetal alkyl amides are important as single source CVD precursors for nitride thin films. Basic reagents such as oxygen, water, ozone can react with metal alkyl amides to produce oxide films\nA major driving force for the recent interest is the prospective seen for ALD in scaling down microelectronic devices according to Moore's law. \nALD is considered a subclass of chemical vapour deposition. The majority of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with the surface of a material one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Through the repeated exposure to separate precursors, a thin film is slowly deposited. ALD is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, and part of the set of tools available for the synthesis of nanomaterials. \nIn contrast to chemical vapour deposition, the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but they are inserted as a series of sequential, non-overlapping pulses. In each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a self-limiting way, so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed. Consequently, the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the precursors (a so-called ALD cycle) is determined by the nature of the precursor-surface interaction. By varying the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision on arbitrarily complex and large substrates. <p>Drier.</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant.

Zirconium is more toxic in soft water than in hard\r\nwater. The toxicity of zirconium salts and zirconium complexes with organic\r\nacids are expected to be related to their water solubilities and their octanol/\r\nwater partition coefficient (Kow). Compounds with molecular weights exceeding\r\n1000 are not expected to be absorbed by aquatic organisms even if they are\r\nwater soluble. Only water-soluble zirconium compounds with a molecular weight\r\nof less than 1000 are expected to be toxic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Zirconium does not bioaccumulate up aquatic\r\nfood chains beyond algae and shellfish. Plants tend to contain far lower\r\nconcentrations of zirconium than the soils in which they are grown, Most\r\nstudies indicate that of the zirconium ingested by mammals little is absorbed\r\nor retained.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><span>For fatty acid salts:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Environmental fate:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Several tests concerning biodegradation are\r\navailable.

For this reason, the length of the fatty\r\nacid chain does not preclude biodegradation, but it may take longer to achieve\r\ncomplete mineralisation. The beta-oxidation sequence does not necessarily\r\nrequire the presence of molecular oxygen, and fatty acid biodegradation may\r\nproceed under anaerobic conditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Above a certain concentration level these\r\nsoaps will form micelles, which are aggregates of soap molecules into larger,\r\noriented groups. This Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) may be around 1000\r\nmg/l but depends on many factors like the molecule structure, the salt content\r\nof the solution and the temperature it may be an order of magnitude lower or\r\nhigher.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The soap concentration in the environment\r\nare in the range of or far below 10 mg/l, whereas the CMC is usually 10-100\r\ntimes higher. At conditions for biodegradability or toxicity testing\r\nconcentrations above the CMC may occur.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Ecotoxicity:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>There are a number of acute data for fatty\r\nacids and fatty acid salts to aquatic organisms although there is a\r\npredominance of data for fatty acid. There are few toxicity values for\r\nterrestrial organisms. Data availability / quality covering all the taxonomic\r\ngroups for specific fatty acid salt chain lengths is poor. The chronic data set\r\nis very limited. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>For chain lengths &gt;C12, solubility\r\ndecreases to a degree where an adverse effect would not be expected in the\r\nenvironment due to reduced biovailability. Data for longer chain lengths have\r\nbeen generated using solvents which makes interpretation more difficult. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>The most of few available data indicate low\r\ntoxicity towards aquatic organisms with EC/LC50 values above 1000 mg/l.\r\nHowever, EC/LC50 values below 100 mg/l are not unusual either. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Notes:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span>Fatty acid soaps are widely used in\r\nhousehold cleaning products, cosmetics, lubricants (and other miscellaneous\r\nindustrial applications) and coatings. Uses in household cleaning\u00a0 include\r\nfabric washing products, fabric conditioners, laundry additives, and surface\r\nand toilet cleaners. These uses cover chain lengths of C10-22 predominantly\r\nwith counter-ions of sodium and potassium.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

It is not mutagenic in Ames test, but is\r\ncapable of inducing chromosome aberration and sister chromatid exchanges in\r\nvitro, liver toxicity and liver tumours after repeated dose treatment, In\r\naddition, 2-EHA has been associated with reproductive and developmental\r\ntoxicity in experimental animals</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">2-EHA is quickly resorbed orally,\r\ndermally and following inhalation and almost fully excreted mainly in urine.

These\r\neffects were noted in the absence of signs of maternal toxicity. The lowest\r\nobserved adverse effect level (LOAEL) for developmental toxicity was reported\r\nto be 100 mg/kg bw/day.\u00a0 Effects on fertility were also reported, with evidence\r\nbeing sufficient to warrant classification as potentially toxic to fertility.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">2-Ethylhexanol (CAS No. 104-76-7)\r\nwas reported to cause developmental toxicity, but not teratogenicity, in rats\r\nfollowing treatment via the oral route (NICNAS a).

No teratogenic effects were observed in this study. In\r\ncomparison with the structural isomer valproic acid, a known human teratogen,\r\n2-EHA does have similar reprotoxic effects at maternal toxic doses in animal\r\nexperiments but a far lower potency</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Following sub-chronic oral\r\nadministration of 2-EHA, critical effects like liver changes (higher relative\r\nliver weight, histological changes in hepatocytes) were observed in rats and\r\nmice and histological renal tubule results were observed in mice. Furthermore,\r\nstatistically significant, higher cholesterol values were found in all treated\r\nmale rats (61, 303 and 917 mg/kg body weight/day) and in male and female mice\r\nin the middle and high dose groups (885-3139 mg/kg body weight/day). In rats\r\nthe maximum dose with no adverse effect (NOAEL) was 61 mg/kg body weight/day In\r\nbacterial test systems, mutagenicity studies produced negative findings. In\r\ntest systems with mammalian cells, by contrast, the findings were weakly\r\npositive. Cytogenetic and SCE studies involving CHO cells were positive, one\r\nSCE test in human lymphocytes was questionably positive and one experiment\r\nconcerning tritium-thymidine incorporation into the DNA of mouse lymphocytes\r\nwas negative. Furthermore,\u00a0 An unpublished micronucleus study on the bone\r\nmarrow of CD-1 mice was conducted in compliance with OECD Guideline 474. No\r\nsignificant increase in the micronuclei was observed at doses of 400, 800 or\r\n1,600 mg/kg body weight (Inveresk Research International Ltd, 1994).\r\nFurthermore, <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo </i>genotoxicity data (micronucleus\r\ntest, dominant lethal test) are available for 2-ethylhexanol which is rapidly\r\nand quantitatively converted into 2-EHA in metabolism studies. This data do not\r\nindicate any genotoxic potential which means that such an effect of 2-EHA is\r\nnot likely either. As 2-EHA can induce both DNA synthesis and inhibition of\r\nintercellular communication\u00a0 in hepatic cells, a tumour-promoting potential in\r\nrodents, comparable to that of other peroxisome proliferators, cannot be ruled\r\nout. The carcinogenic effect of peroxisome proliferators in rodents (e.g. of\r\ndi(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, DEHP) is not deemed to be relevant for humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Calcium/zinc and barium/zinc\r\nsalts of 2-EHA are used as thermo-stabilisers for PVC, together with\r\nco-stabilisers like polyols or epoxy compounds, in order to capture the\r\nhydrochloride cleaved during the thermal loading of PVC; in addition various\r\nsalts are used in other food and beverage containers as plasticisers.\u00a0 The\r\nmigration of 2-EHA from the sealing compounds in the metal lids. has been\r\ndemonstrated in food contamination</span><span style=\"color:black\">. </span><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\npotential for human exposure to 2-EHA therefore is significant.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

For example, in \"open vessel processes\" (with man-hole size openings, in an industrial setting), substances with exothermic decomposition energies below 500 J/g are unlikely to present a danger, whilst those in \"closed vessel processes\" (opening is a safety valve or bursting disk) present some danger where the decomposition energy exceeds 150 J/g.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>BRETHERICK: Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 4th Edition</p> <ul> <li>Avoid any contamination of this material as it is very reactive and any contamination is potentially hazardous\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Ketones in this group:</p> <ul> <li>are reactive with many acids and bases liberating heat and flammable gases (e.g., H2).\u00a0</li> <li>react with reducing agents such as hydrides, alkali metals, and nitrides to produce flammable gas (H2) and heat.\u00a0</li> <li>are incompatible with isocyanates, aldehydes, cyanides, peroxides, and anhydrides.\u00a0</li> <li>react violently with aldehydes, HNO3 (nitric acid), HNO3 + H2O2 (mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide), and HClO4 (perchloric acid).\u00a0</li> <li>may react with hydrogen peroxide to form unstable peroxides; many are heat- and shock-sensitive explosives.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>A significant property of most ketones is that the hydrogen atoms on the carbons next to the carbonyl group are relatively acidic when compared to hydrogen atoms in typical hydrocarbons.

At 20 C, MEKO is hydrolytically unstable at pH 4, whereas no hydrolysis occurs at pH 9. At pH 7, 14% of the substance was hydrolysed after 4 days. Therefore, at neutral to acidic environmental conditions, hydrolysis may be an important degradation pathway for this substance. Hydrolysis products are methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) (CAS RN 78-93-3) and hydroxylamine (CAS RN 7803-49-8) . The inherent biodegradation study (MITI 1992) suggests that this substance undergoes relatively rapid primary biodegradation, but that ultimate degradation is slower\u00a0</p> <p>The BIOWIN (2008) aerobic biodegradation models (BIOWIN submodels 3, 4, 5 and 6) suggest that MEKO biodegrades rapidly\u00a0</p> <p>Although little MEKO is expected to partition to sediment, the modelled BIOWIN (2008) biodegradation timeframes (order of weeks), along with the potential for hydrolysis, suggest that the primary degradation half-life in water is likely &lt;90 days.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on the empirical and modelled data , MEKO meets the persistence criterion in air (half-life in air .2 days), but does not meet the criteria for water, soil or sediment (half-lives in soil and water .182 days and half-life in sediment . 365 days), as set out in the\u00a0<i>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations\u00a0</i>(Canada 2000).\u00a0</p> <p>Experimental log Kow values for MEKO suggest that this chemical has low potential to bioaccumulate in biota. Experimentally derived bioconcentration factors (BCF) of 0.5-5.8 for carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) and Japanese medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) (MITI 1992; ECB 2000) demonstrate that MEKO is not bioaccumulative\u00a0</p> <p>Furthermore, log Kow values for the hydrolysis products methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and hydroxylamine are very low , indicating that these chemicals also have low potential to bioaccumulate.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on the available empirical and kinetic-based modelled values, MEKO does not meet the bioaccumulation criteria (BAF or BCF .5000) as set out in the\u00a0<i>Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations\u00a0</i>(Canada 2000).\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The toxicity data indicate that MEKO has a moderate potential to be toxic to algae and a low potential for most other aquatic organisms. Furthermore, considering the toxicity of the hydrolysis products (methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and hydroxylamine), as well as the low rate of hydrolysis (14% in 4 days) under environmental conditions, the risk due to the hydrolysis products of MEKO is not expected to be significantly higher than that of the compound itself\u00a0</p> <p>Fish LC50 (48 \u00a0h): Oryzias latipes (Medaka) 560 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) 10-840 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 (48 h): 750 mg/l</p> <p>EC50 \u00a0(0.1 h): Vibrio (Photobacterium) phosphoreum 950 ppm</p> <p>Toxicity invertebrate: tox bac 0.63g/l, protozoa 2.5g/l</p> <p>Effects on algae and plankton: tox to algae at 1g/l</p> <p>.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Several ketoximes (p-quinone dioxime, acetoxime and methyl ethyl ketoxime) have elicited carcinogenic effects on chronic exposure. Few substantive studies have been performed with aldoximes. The fact that aldoximes can be metabolised to cyanide via a pathway not applicable to ketoximes distinguishes the type of response which might be anticipated. Dehydration of aldoximes to produce nitriles has been shown to be catalysed in vitro by cytochrome P450; dehydration of ketoximes produces amides, rather than nitriles, via a Beckmann rearrangement but this apparently has no analogue in biological systems.</p> <p>The mechanism and toxicity of oximes to erythrocytes is recognised and might be attributed to hydroxylamine, a product of hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine produces haematologic effects such as methaemoglobinaemia and splenomegaly in mice similar to those observed after exposure to oximes such as butanal oxime. Studies demonstrated the formation of haeme-associated free radicals in erythrocytes exposed to hydroxylamine, leading ultimately to peroxidation of membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes may produce several morphological alterations resulting, for example, in membrane aggregation, deformation or breakage. This may result in the release of hydrolytic enzymes which in turn may degrade functional macromolecules and cause secondary damage. In addition membrane-bound enzyme systems may be disrupted. Levels of hydroxylamine produced as a result of hydrolysis are thought to be too low to produce another sign of hydroxylamine toxicity, namely the formation of Heinz bodies</p> <p>Oximes are not easily oxidised at near neutral conditions and hydrolysis by liver microsomes or S9 is hypothesised (however this conclusion was based on the formation of a ketone rather than hydroxylamine). Another possibility is that oximes are oxidatively metabolised to yield a ketone or aldehyde and some yet to be determined nitrogen-containing species. Cytochrome P450 appears to provide a source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide which catalyses oxidation in the presence of iron. \u00a0At least part of the nitrogen in the oxime is converted to nitric oxide which complexes with haeme to give a nitrosylhaemoglobin complex.</p> <p>Methyl ethyl ketoxime (MEKO) administered to rats by gavage at 25, 75 and 225 mg/kg/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks, produced dose-related decreases in red blood cell counts and haemoglobin and haematocrit values accompanied by a mild to marked reticulocytosis (increased number of young red blood cells).</p> <p>Other effects included a dose-related pattern of spleen, liver and kidney weights. The spleen and liver showed evidence of compensatory red blood cell production suggesting that, in the rat, MEKO induces haemolytic anaemia with complementary erythropoiesis. A no-observed-effect-level was not established but effects at 25 mg/kg were described as minimal.</p> <p>When MEKO was administered to rats at dose levels of 0.5, and 1.0 ml/kg/day, daily for 4 weeks, transient central nervous system depression immediately followed. At 4 weeks dose-related decreases were seen in red blood cell count and haemoglobin. Dose-related increases were evident in spleen weight (from 1.7 to 3.2 fold). It was concluded that 0.1 ml/kg produced only minimal effects. When rats were exposed by inhalation to MEKO vapour for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, mild increases in blood mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, reticulocyte count and red blood cell count were seen at 533 and 714 ppm. Spleen weights were increased and haemosiderosis (deposits of iron) in the spleen were seen at 714 ppm.</p> <p>Haemosiderosis probably resulted from red blood cell haemolysis. Exposures at 60 and 283 ppm produced no observed effects.</p> <p>An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed microscopically in male mice exposed to 375 ppm for 18 months. Both male and female mice exposed at 375 ppm showed enlarged livers but tumours did not occur in females.</p> <p>Repeated exposure to hydroxylamine and derivatives may result in respiratory sensitisation with asthma-like symptoms.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Overexposure to respirable dust may produce wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties leading to or symptomatic of impaired respiratory function.</p> <p>Acute silicosis occurs under conditions of extremely high silica dust exposure particularly when the particle size of the dust is small. It differs greatly from classical silicosis both clinically and pathologically. The disease is rapidly progressive with diffuse pulmonary involvement developing only months after the initial exposure and causing deaths within 1 to 2 years. It is often complicated by an associated tuberculosis. The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage. This causes the macrophage to be digested by its own enzymes and after lysis the free silica is released to be ingested by other macrophages thus continuing initiate collagen formation in the lung tissue producing the characteristic nodule found in classical (chronic) silicosis.</p>",

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure. Chronic inhalation in rats by single or\r\nrepeated intratracheal instillation produced a significant increase in the\r\nincidences of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\r\nLifetime inhalation of crystalline silica (87% alpha-quartz) at 1 mg/m3 (74%\r\nrespirable) by rats, produced an increase in animals with keratinising cystic\r\nsquamous cell tumours, adenomas, adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous cell\r\ncarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma and nodular bronchiolar alveolar\r\nhyperplasia accompanied by extensive subpleural and peribronchiolar fibrosis,\r\nincreased pulmonary collagen content, focal lipoproteinosis and macrophage\r\ninfiltration.

Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities.

In unsaturated topsoil containing organic material, it has been estimated that 97% of the toluene is adsorbed to the soil and only about 2% is in the soil-water phase and transported with flowing groundwater. There is little retardation in sandy soils and 2-13% of the toluene was estimated to migrate with flowing water; the remainder was volatilised, biodegraded, or unaccounted for. In saturated deep soils with no soil-air phase, about 48% may be transported with flowing groundwater.</p> <p><b>Transformation/Persistence:</b></p> <p><b>Air\u00a0</b>- The main degradation pathway for toluene in the atmosphere is reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The estimated atmospheric half life for toluene is about 13 hours. Toluene is also oxidised by reactions with atmospheric nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and ozone, but these are minor degradation pathways. Photolysis is not considered a significant degradative pathway for toluene\u00a0</p> <p><b>Soil\u00a0</b>- In surface soil, volatilisation to air is an important fate process for toluene. Biodegradation of toluene has been demonstrated in the laboratory to occur with a half life of about 1 hour. In the environment, biodegradation of toluene to carbon dioxide occurs with a typical half life of 1-7 days.</p> <p><b>Water\u00a0</b>- An important fate process for toluene is volatilization, the rate of which depends on the amount of turbulence in the surface water .The volatilisation of toluene from static water has a half life of 1-16 days, whereas from turbulent water the half life is 5-6 hours. Degradation of toluene in surface water occurs primarily by biodegradation with a half life of less than one day under favorable conditions (presence of microorganisms, microbial adaptation, and optimum temperature). Biodegradation also occurs in shallow groundwater and in salt water at a reduced rate). No data are available on anaerobic degradation of toluene in deep ground water conditions where aerobic degradation would be minimal .</p> <p><b>Biota\u00a0</b>- Bioaccumulation in most organisms is limited by the metabolism of toluene into more polar compounds that have greater water solubility and a lower affinity for lipids.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",

At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Chronic toluene habituation occurs following intentional abuse (glue sniffing) or from occupational exposure. Ataxia, incoordination and tremors of the hands and feet (as a consequence of diffuse cerebral atrophy), headache, abnormal speech, transient memory loss, convulsions, coma, drowsiness, reduced colour perception, frank blindness, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye-movements), hearing loss leading to deafness and mild dementia have all been associated with chronic abuse. Peripheral nerve damage, encephalopathy, giant axonopathy electrolyte disturbances in the cerebrospinal fluid and abnormal computer tomographic (CT scans) are common amongst toluene addicts. Although toluene abuse has been linked with kidney disease, this does not commonly appear in cases of occupational toluene exposures. Cardiac and haematological toxicity are however associated with chronic toluene exposures. Cardiac arrhythmia, multifocal and premature ventricular contractions and supraventricular tachycardia are present in 20% of patients who abused toluene-containing paints. Previous suggestions that chronic toluene inhalation produced human peripheral neuropathy have been discounted. However central nervous system (CNS) depression is well documented where blood toluene exceeds 2.2 mg%. Toluene abusers can achieve transient circulating concentrations of 6.5 %. Amongst workers exposed for a median time of 29 years, to toluene, no subacute effects on neurasthenic complaints and psychometric test results could be established.\u00a0</p> <p>The prenatal toxicity of very high toluene concentrations has been documented for several animal species and man. Malformations indicative of specific teratogenicity have not generally been found. Neonatal toxicity, described in the literature, takes the form of embryo death or delayed foetal growth and delayed skeletal system development. Permanent damage of children has been seen only when mothers have suffered from chronic intoxication as a result of \"sniffing\".</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient and is usually the limiting nutrient for blue-green algae. A lake undergoing eutrophication shows a rapid growth of algae in surface waters. Planktonic algae cause turbidity and flotation films. Shore algae cause ugly muddying, films and damage to reeds. Decay of these algae causes oxygen depletion in the deep water and shallow water near the shore. The process is self-perpetuating because anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface causes the release of more adsorbed phosphates from the sediment. The growth of algae produces undesirable effects on the treatment of water for drinking purposes, on fisheries, and on the use of lakes for recreational purposes.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For zinc and its compounds:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Zinc is capable of forming complexes with a variety of organic and\r\ninorganic groups (ligands).

As negative charges on soil surfaces increase with increasing pH,\r\nadditional sites for zinc adsorption are activated and the amount of zinc in\r\nsolution decreases. The active zinc species in the adsorbed state is the singly\r\ncharged zinc hydroxide species (i.e., Zn[OH]+). Other investigators have also\r\nshown that the mobility of zinc in soil increases at lower soil pH under\r\noxidizing conditions and at a lower cation exchange capacity of soil. On the\r\nother hand, the amount of zinc in solution generally increases when the pH is\r\n&gt;7 in soils high in organic matter. This is a result of the release of\r\norganically complexed zinc, reduced zinc adsorption at higher pH, or an\r\nincrease in the concentration of chelating agents in soil. For calcareous\r\nsoils, the relationship between zinc solubility and pH is nonlinear. At a high\r\npH, zinc in solution is precipitated as Zn(OH)2, zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), or\r\ncalcium zincate.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Other symptoms include upper respiratory tract irritation accompanied by coughing and a dryness of the mucous membranes, lassitude and a generalised feeling of malaise. Mild to severe headache, nausea, occasional vomiting, fever or chills, exaggerated mental activity, profuse sweating, diarrhoea, excessive urination and prostration may also occur.

Leucocytosis, a transient increase in white blood cell counts, is reported as a common finding in metal fume fever but is not known to be common amongst welders.

Vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, in several cases with blood, have been observed after ingestion of zinc sulfate.</p> <p>Several cases of gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported after ingestion of zinc sulfate. A significant reduction in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (47% decrease), hematocrit, and serum ferritin, compared to pretreatment levels, occurred in female subjects who received supplements (as capsules) of 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 10 weeks. A 15% decrease in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was reported in male volunteers receiving 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 6 weeks. Another study reported increases in bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels (~25%) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (~15%), while significant decreases were seen in mononuclear white cell 5'-nucleotidase (~30%) and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activity (~36%) following exposure of postmenopausal women to a combined (dietary+supplemental) 53 mg zinc/day as zinc glycine chelate. Healthy men given 200 mg zinc/day as elemental zinc for 6 weeks showed a reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response to phytohemagglutinin as well as chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.; however, no changes in lymphocyte cell number or in the proportion of lymphocyte populations were noted. Exposure of male volunteers to 0.48 mg zinc/kg/day, as zinc glycine chelate, had no effect on markers of coagulation relative to unexposed subjects. While the changes in</p> <p>hematological end points following long-term zinc exposure in humans are noteworthy, they were subclinical in nature, and therefore, are generally considered to be non-adverse. In animals, following oral administration of zinc compounds, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte, and/or leukocyte levels were observed in rats, mice, rabbits , dogs, ferrets, and preruminant calves A number of intermediate-duration studies have demonstrated renal effects in animals exposed to zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc acetate. Zinc sulfate caused an increase in the absolute and relative kidney weights and regressive kidney lesions (not specified) in female mice that consumed 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day in the diet for 13 weeks, but no effects occurred in rats that consumed 565 mg zinc/kg/day or in mice that consumed 104 mg zinc/kg/day under similar conditions. Severe diffuse nephrosis was</p> <p>observed in ferrets exposed to 195 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet . In rats exposed to 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 3 months, epithelial cell damage in the glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubules and increased plasma creatinine and urea levels were observed. Zinc plays a role in the normal development and maintenance of the immune system, such as in the lymphocyte response to mitogens and as a cofactor for the thymic hormone thymulin. Oral exposure to zinc at levels much higher than the recommended daily dose has impaired immune and inflammatory responses. This was observed in in vivo investigations of the immune competence of blood components taken from 11 healthy adult men after ingestion of 4.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 6 weeks. The mitogenic response elicited from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the chemotactic and phagocytic responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were impaired after zinc ingestion. No effects were seen on total numbers of lymphocytes or relative numbers of T cells, T cell subsets, or B cells. The relationship between these observations and decreased levels of immune competence that might lead to increased susceptibility to disease is unknown. A later study reported no effects of supplementation of male volunteers with 30 mg zinc/day (0.43 mg zinc/kg/day assuming a reference male body weight of 70 kg) as zinc glycine chelate for 14 weeks on levels of peripheral blood leucocytes or on the frequency of lymphocyte subsets.</p> <p>Zinc appears to be necessary for normal brain function, but excess zinc is toxic. A 16-year-old boy who ingested .86 mg zinc/kg/day of metallic zinc over a 2-day period in an attempt to promote wound healing, developed signs and symptoms of lethargy, light-headedness, staggering, and difficulty in writing clearly . Lethargy was also observed in a 2-year-old child who ingested a zinc chloride solution (.1,000 mg zinc/kg). It is not known whether these observations represent direct effects on the nervous system. Very limited data were located regarding neurological effects in animals. Minor neuron degeneration and proliferation of oligodendroglia occurred in rats dosed with 487 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 10 days. Rats receiving 472 mg zinc/kg/day for 10 days had increased levels of secretory material in the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus. Mice exposed postnatally to 0.5 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 28 days showed no changes in memory formation, but showed a gradual decrease in learning extinction throughout the study.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Phosphates are slowly and incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are unlikely (other than in abuse) to produce the systemic effects which occur when introduced by other routes. Such effects include vomiting, lethargy, fever, diarrhoea, falls in blood pressure, slow pulse, cyanosis, carpal spasm, coma and tetany. These effects result following sequestration of blood calcium.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Ingestion of large amounts of phosphate salts (over 1 gm for an adult) may produce osmotic catharsis resulting in diarrhoea and probably, abdominal cramp. Large doses (4-8 gm) will almost certainly produce these effects in most individuals. Most of the ingested salt will be excreted in the faeces of healthy individuals without producing systemic toxicity. Doses in excess of 10 gm may produce systemic toxicity.</p>",
