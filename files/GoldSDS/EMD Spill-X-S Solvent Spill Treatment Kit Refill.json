Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>The TLV-TWA for carbon black is recommended to minimise complaints of excessive dirtiness and applies only to commercially produced carbon blacks or to soots derived from combustion sources containing absorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Effects on lungs are significantly enhanced in the presence of respirable particles.

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chronic inhalation exposure of production workers has caused\r\ndecreased pulmonary function ad myocardial dystrophy.

Several other\r\nstudies provide conflicting evidence. Early studies in the former USSR and\r\nEastern Europe report respiratory diseases amongst workers exposed to carbon\r\nblack, including bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema and rhinitis. These studies\r\nare of questionable validity due to inadequate study design and methodology,\r\nlack of appropriate controls for cigarette smoking and other confounding\r\nfactors such as concurrent exposure to carbon dioxide, coal oil and petroleum\r\nvapours. Moreover, review of these studies indicates that the concentrations of\r\ncarbon black were greater than current occupational standards.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black may cause adverse pulmonary changes following\r\nprolonged or repeated inhalation of the dust; these include oral mucosal\r\nlesions, bronchitis and pneumoconiosis which may lead to lung tumours.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The body of evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies\r\ncomes from two chronic inhalation studies and two intratracheal instillation\r\nstudies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in\r\nexposed animals. An inhalation study was tested on mice, but did not show\r\nsignificantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic\r\ndata comes from three different cohort studies of carbon black production\r\nworkers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000\r\nworkers in each study group, showed elevated mortality from lung cancer in the\r\ncarbon black workers. Another study of over 5,000 workers in the United States\r\ndid not show elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers.\r\nNewer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK\r\nstudy may suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However,\r\na more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis\r\nthat carbon black acts as a late-stage carcinogen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In studies employing channel and furnace black, hamsters,\r\nmice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys exposed to dusts for 7 hours/day, 5\r\ndays/week, at concentrations of 87.4 mg/m3 for channel black and 56.5 mg/m3 for\r\nfurnace black, no malignancies were observed in any of the animals. Channel\r\nblack had little if any absorbed polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (as benzene\r\nextractables) whilst furnace black had 0.28%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Several findings have strengthened the association between\r\ninflammation and cancer and between the particle surface area dose of carbon\r\nblack and other\u00a0 poorly soluble low toxicity (PSLT) particles and the pulmonary\r\ninflammation response in mice and the proinflammatory effects in lung cells in\r\nvitro. Other evidence suggests that in addition to a cancer mechanism involving\r\nindirect genotoxicity through inflammation and oxidative stress, nanoparticles\r\nmay act as direct carcinogens .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black appears to act like PSLT particles, which can\r\nelicit lung tumours in rats following prolonged exposure to sufficiently high\r\nconcentrations of particles. Particle surface area dose was found to be most\r\npredictive of pulmonary inflammation and tumour response in rats when comparing\r\nthe dose-response relationships for various types and sizes of PSLT including\r\ncarbon black. Compared to fine PSLT, much lower concentrations of ultrafine\r\nPSLT (e.g. 2.5, 6.5 or 11.5 mg/m3 carbon black and ~10 mg/m3 ultrafine titanium\r\ndioxide) were associated with impaired clearance, persistent inflammation, and\r\nmalignant lung tumours in chronic inhalation studies in rats. Most evidence\r\nsuggests that carbon black and other PSLT-elicited lung tumours occurs through\r\na secondary genotoxic mechanism, involving chronic inflammation and oxidative\r\nstress. Experimental studies have shown that when the particle lung dose\r\nreaches a sufficiently high concentration (e.g.,mass dose of ~0.5 mg fine-sized\r\nPSLT/g lung in rats), the alveolar macrophage-medicated clearance process\r\nbegins to be impaired (complete impairment occurs at ~10 mg/g lung. Overloading\r\nof lung clearance is accompanied by pulmonary inflammation, leading to\r\nincreased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, depletion of\r\nantioxidants and/or impairment of other defense mechanisms, cell injury, cell\r\nproliferation, fibrosis, and as seen in rats,\u00a0 induction of mutations and\r\neventually cancer. Rats appear to be more sensitive to carbon black and other\r\nPSLT than other rodent species. Although studies in humans have not shown a\r\ndirect link between inhaled PSLT and lung cancer, many of the steps in the\r\nmechanism observed in rats have also been observed in humans who work in dusty\r\njobs, including increased particle lung retention and pulmonary inflammation in\r\nworkers exposed to coal dust or crystalline silica and elevated lung cancer has\r\nbeen observed in some studies of workers exposed to carbon black, crystalline\r\nsilica, and diesel exhaust particles</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Monkeys exposed to channel black for 1000-1500 hours showed\r\nevidence of electrocardiac changes indicative of right atrial and right\r\nventricular strain. These changes increased progressively until after 10,000\r\nhours of exposure, when the changes were marked. The authors of this study\r\nconcluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged exposure other\r\nthan those expected from the accumulation of non-toxic dusts in the pulmonary\r\nsystem. Exposure to furnace black produced a similar picture although\r\nelectrocardiographic change was first observed in monkeys after 2500 hours'\r\nexposure and marked atrial and right ventricular strain after 10,000 hours' exposure.\r\nThe authors concluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged\r\nexposure other than those expected from the accumulation of nontoxic dusts in\r\nthe pulmonary system.

The activity of some carcinogens appear to be inhibited by\r\ncarbon black itself.</p>",
