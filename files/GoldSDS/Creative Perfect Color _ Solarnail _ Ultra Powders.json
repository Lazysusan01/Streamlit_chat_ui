Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>aldehydes</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Burns with intense heat.

These ingredients\r\nfunction in cosmetics as binders, film formers, hair fixatives, suspending\r\nagents, viscosity-increasing agents, and emulsion stabilizers. Concentrations\r\nmay be as high as 25% if used as a binder, film former, or fixative; or as low\r\nas 0.5% if used as a viscosity-increasing agent, suspending agent, or emulsion\r\nstabilizer. These very large polymers exhibit little toxicity. In rabbits and\r\nguinea pigs, Acrylates Copolymer did produce irritation, but no evidence of\r\nsensitization was found. The principle concern regarding the use of these\r\npolymer ingredients is the presence of toxic residual monomers. In particular,\r\nalthough 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was not genotoxic, it was carcinogenic when\r\napplied at a concentration of 21% to the skin of C3H mice. Lower concentrations\r\n(2.5%) and stop-dose studies at high concentrations (43%) were not\r\ncarcinogenic. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was not carcinogenic in studies using NMRI\r\nmice. Whether an increase in carcinogenesis was seen or not, there was evidence\r\nof severe dermal irritation in these 2-ethylhexyl acrylate studies. Another\r\nconcern regarding residual monomers was inhalation toxicity. Although the\r\nacrylic acid monomer is a nasal irritant, exposure to the monomer from use of\r\nthese polymers in cosmetic formulations would always be less than the\r\nestablished occupational exposure limits for nasal irritation. Although there\r\nappears to be a huge variation in the mix of monomers used in the synthesis of\r\nthese polymers, they are similar in that the polymers, except for dermal\r\nirritation, are not significantly toxic, and residual monomer levels are kept\r\nas low as possible. Although the monomers may be toxic, the levels that would\r\nbe found in cosmetic formulations are not considered to present a safety risk.\r\nAccordingly, these Acrylate Copolymers are considered safe for use in cosmetic\r\nformulations when formulated to avoid irritation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Final Report on the Safety\r\nAssessment of Acrylates Copolymer and 33 Related Cosmetic Ingredients\u00a0 R.M.\r\nAdams et al International Journal of Toxicology\u00a0 Volume: 21 issue: 3_suppl,\r\npage(s): 1-50 Issue published: November 1, 2002 </span></p>|Powder particles may have a mild abrasive effect on the skin and eyes.",

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.</p> <p>Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact with benzoyl peroxide may result in allergic reactions such as sensitisation dermatitis.</p> <p>Diluted forms of benzoyl peroxide when used as acne and skin bleach treatment results in 1-2% of these applications showing allergic responses and / or sensitisation.</p> <p>Ingestion of material results in abdominal pain, cyanosis and severe depression.</p> <p>Chronic effects of exposure include allergic reactions characterised by redness, itching, oozing, crusting, and scaling of the skin and asthmatic wheezing. Patch testing (Draize procedure) the upper lateral portion of the arms of volunteers to 5% dibenzoyl peroxide produce reactions in 32% of the volunteers following ten epicutaneous applications administered for induction of a response.</p> <p>When repeatedly applied to the skin of mice dibenzoyl peroxide was not carcinogenic. However dibenzoyl peroxide is a tumour promoter in mice and hamsters producing papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas. It does not however exhibit complete carcinogenic or tumour-initiating activity.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic exposure to certain peroxides produces allergic dermatitis (with redness and scaling of the skin) and asthmatic wheezing.</p>",
