Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media.

In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated\r\nby plants and animals.Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or\r\notherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental\r\nfate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminium\r\noccurs in the environment in the form of silicates, oxides and hydroxides,\r\ncombined with other elements such as sodium, fluorine and arsenic complexes\r\nwith organic matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acidification\r\nof soils releases aluminium as a transportable solution. Mobilisation of\r\naluminium by acid rain results in aluminium becoming available for plant\r\nuptake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As an\r\nelement, aluminum cannot be degraded in the environment, but may undergo\r\nvarious precipitation or ligand exchange reactions. Aluminum in compounds has\r\nonly one oxidation state (+3), and would not undergo oxidation-reduction\r\nreactions under environmental conditions. Aluminum can be complexed by various\r\nligands present in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids). The\r\nsolubility of aluminum in the environment will depend on the ligands present\r\nand the pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ntrivalent aluminum ion is surrounded by six water molecules in solution. The\r\nhydrated aluminum ion, [Al(H2O)6]3+, undergoes hydrolysis, in which a stepwise\r\ndeprotonation of the coordinated water ligands forms bound hydroxide ligands\r\n(e.g., [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+, [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+). The speciation of aluminum in water\r\nis pH dependent. The hydrated trivalent aluminum ion is the predominant form at\r\npH levels below 4. Between pH 5 and 6, the predominant hydrolysis products are\r\nAl(OH)2+ and Al(OH)2+, while the solid Al(OH)3 is most prevalent between pH 5.2\r\nand 8.8. The soluble species Al(OH)4- is the predominant species above pH 9,\r\nand is the only species present above pH 10. Polymeric aluminum hydroxides\r\nappear between pH 4.7 and 10.5, and increase in size until they are transformed\r\ninto colloidal particles of amorphous Al(OH)3, which crystallise to gibbsite in\r\nacid waters. Polymerisation is affected by the presence of dissolved silica;\r\nwhen enough silica is present, aluminum is precipitated as poorly crystallised\r\nclay mineral species.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyaluminum\r\ncompounds are considered amphoteric (e.g., they can act as both acids and bases\r\nin solution). Because of this property, aluminum hydroxides can act as buffers\r\nand resist pH changes within the narrow pH range of 4-5.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monomeric\r\naluminum compounds, typified by aluminum fluoride, chloride, and sulfate, are\r\nconsidered reactive or labile compounds, whereas polymeric aluminum species\r\nreact much more slowly in the environment. Aluminum has a stronger attraction\r\nfor fluoride in an acidic environment compared to other inorganic ligand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nadsorption of aluminum onto clay surfaces can be a significant factor in\r\ncontrolling aluminum mobility in the environment, and these adsorption\r\nreactions, measured in one study at pH 3.0-4.1, have been observed to be very\r\nrapid. However, clays may act either as a sink or a source for soluble aluminum\r\ndepending on the degree of aluminum saturation on the clay surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Within\r\nthe pH range of 5-6, aluminum complexes with phosphate and is removed from\r\nsolution. Because phosphate is a necessary nutrient in ecological systems, this\r\nimmobilization of both aluminum and phosphate may result in depleted nutrient\r\nstates in surface water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant\r\nspecies and cultivars of the same species differ considerably in their ability\r\nto take up and translocate aluminum to above-ground parts. Tea leaves may\r\ncontain very high concentrations of aluminum, &gt;5,000 mg/kg in old leaves.\r\nOther plants that may contain high levels of aluminum include Lycopodium\r\n(Lycopodiaceae), a few ferns, Symplocos (Symplocaceae), and Orites\r\n(Proteaceae). Aluminum is often taken up and concentrated in root tissue. In\r\nsub-alpine ecosystems, the large root biomass of the Douglas fir, <i>Abies\r\namabilis</i>, takes up aluminum and immobilizes it, preventing large\r\naccumulation in above-ground tissue. It is unclear to what extent aluminum is\r\ntaken up into root food crops and leafy vegetables. An uptake factor\r\n(concentration of aluminum in the plant/concentration of aluminum in soil) of\r\n0.004 for leafy vegetables and 0.00065 for fruits and tubers has been reported,\r\nbut the pH and plant species from which these uptake factors were derived are\r\nunclear. Based upon these values, however, it is clear that aluminum is not\r\ntaken up in plants from soil, but is instead biodiluted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminum\r\nconcentrations in rainbow trout from an alum-treated lake, an untreated lake,\r\nand a hatchery were highest in gill tissue and lowest in muscle. Aluminum\r\nresidue analyses in brook trout have shown that whole-body aluminum content\r\ndecreases as the fish advance from larvae to juveniles. These results imply\r\nthat the aging larvae begin to decrease their rate of aluminum uptake, to\r\neliminate aluminum at a rate that exceeds uptake, or to maintain approximately\r\nthe same amount of aluminum while the body mass increases. The decline in\r\nwhole-body aluminum residues in juvenile brook trout may be related to growth\r\nand dilution by edible muscle tissue that accumulated less aluminum than did\r\nthe other tissues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ngreatest fraction of the gill-associated aluminum was not sorbed to the gill\r\ntissue, but to the gill mucus. It is thought that mucus appears to retard\r\naluminum transport from solution to the membrane surface, thus delaying the\r\nacute biological response of the fish. It has been reported that concentrations\r\nof aluminum in whole-body tissue of the Atlantic salmon exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of aluminum ranging from 3 ug/g (for fish exposed to 33 ug/L) to\r\n96 ug/g (for fish exposed to 264 ug/L) at pH 5.5. After 60 days of exposure,\r\nBCFs ranged from 76 to 190 and were directly related to the aluminum exposure\r\nconcentration. In acidic waters (pH 4.6-5.3) with low concentrations of calcium\r\n(0.5-1.5 mg Ca/L), labile aluminum between 25 and 75 ug/L is toxic. Because\r\naluminum is toxic to many aquatic species, it is not bioaccumulated to a\r\nsignificant degree (BCF &lt;300) in most fish and shellfish; therefore,\r\nconsumption of contaminated fish does not appear to be a significant source of\r\naluminum exposure in humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioconcentration\r\nof aluminum has also been reported for several aquatic invertebrate species.\r\nBCF values ranging from 0.13 to 0.5 in the whole-body were reported for the\r\nsnail. Bioconcentration of aluminum has also been reported for aquatic insects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"color:black\">Freshwater\r\nspecies pH &gt;6.5</span></i></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish:\r\nAcute LC50 (48-96 h) 5 spp: 0.6 (<i>Salmo salar) - </i>106 mg/L; Chronic NOEC\r\n(8-28 d): 7 spp,NOEC, 0.034-7.1 mg/L.

Fish are generally more sensitive to aluminium than\r\naquatic invertebrates. Aluminium is a gill toxicant to fish, causing both\r\nionoregulatory and respiratory effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nbioavailability and toxicity of aluminium is generally greatest in acid\r\nsolutions. Aluminium in acid habitats has been observed to be toxic to fish and\r\nphytoplankton. Aluminium is generally more toxic over the pH range 4.4.5.4,\r\nwith a maximum toxicity occurring around pH 5.0.5.2. The inorganic single unit\r\naluminium species (Al(OH)2 +) is thought to be the most toxic. Under very acid\r\nconditions, the toxic effects of the high H+ concentration appear to be more\r\nimportant than the effects of low concentrations of aluminium; at approximately\r\nneutral pH values, the toxicity of aluminium is greatly reduced. The solubility\r\nof aluminium is also enhanced under alkaline conditions, due to its amphoteric\r\ncharacter, and some researchers found that the acute toxicity of aluminium\r\nincreased from pH 7 to pH 9. However, the opposite relationship was found in\r\nother studies. The uptake and toxicity of aluminium in freshwater organisms\r\ngenerally decreases with increasing water hardness under acidic, neutral and\r\nalkaline conditions. Complexing agents such as fluoride, citrate and humic\r\nsubstances reduce the availability of aluminium to organisms, resulting in\r\nlower toxicity. Silicon can also reduce aluminium toxicity to fish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking\r\nWater Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">aluminium:\r\n200 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">200 ug/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">chloride:\r\n400 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">250 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">fluoride:\r\n1.5 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">1.5 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">nitrate:\r\n50 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">50 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">sulfate:\r\n250 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil\r\nGuideline: none available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air\r\nQuality Standards: none available.</span></p>",

However, these hypotheses remain controversial. Several compounds\r\ncontaining aluminium have the potential to produce neurotoxicity (mice, rats)\r\nand to affect the male reproductive system (dogs). In addition, after maternal\r\nexposure they have shown embryotoxicity (mice) and have affected the developing\r\nnervous system in the offspring (mice, rats).

Several epidemiological\r\nstudies show a possible correlation between the incidence of AD and high levels\r\nof aluminium in drinking water.

Aluminium\r\nconcentrates in brain regions, notably the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and\r\namygdala where it preferentially binds to large pyramid-shaped cells - it does\r\nnot bind to a substantial degree to the smaller interneurons.

Aluminium hyperphosphorylates tau\r\nin vitro. When AD tau is injected into rat brain NFT-like aggregates form but\r\nsoon degrade. Aluminium stabilises these aggregates rendering them resistant to\r\nprotease degradation. Plaque formation is also enhanced by aluminium which\r\ninduces the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein in the thread-like\r\nextensions of nerve cells (axons and dendrites).

The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable taste; the lowest taste threshold concentration for sulfate is approximately 250 mg/litre as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems. No health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/litre.</p> <p>Sulfates are removed from the air by both dry and wet deposition processes. Wet deposition processes including rain-out (a process that occurs within the clouds) and washout (removal by precipitation below the clouds) contribute to the removal of sulfate from the atmosphere.</p> <p>In soil, the inorganic sulfates can adsorb to soil particles or leach into surface water and groundwater. Sulfates can be taken up by plants and be incorporated into the parenchyma of the plant.</p> <p>Sulfate in water can also be reduced by sulfate bacteria (<i>Thiobacilli</i>) which use them as a source of energy.</p> <p>In anaerobic environments sulfate is biologically reduced to (hydrogen) sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria, or incorporated into living organisms as source of sulfur, and thereby included in the sulfur cycle. Sodium sulfate is not reactive in aqueous solution at room temperature. Sodium sulfate will completely dissolve, ionise and distribute across the entire planetary \"aquasphere\". Some sulfates may eventually be deposited, the majority of sulfates participate in the sulfur cycle in which natural and industrial sodium sulfate are not distinguishable</p> <p>The BCF of sodium sulfate is very low and therefore significant bioconcentration is not expected. Sodium and sulfate ions are essential to all living organisms and their intracellular and extracellular concentrations are actively regulated. However some plants (e.g. corn and\u00a0<i>Kochia Scoparia</i>), are capable of accumulating sulfate to concentrations that are potentially toxic to ruminants.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>For sulfate in general:</p> <p>Fish LC50: \u00a0toxic from 7000 mg/l</p> <p>Bacteria: toxic from \u00a02500 mg/l</p> <p>Algae were shown to be the most sensitive to sodium sulfate; EC50 120 h = 1,900 mg/l. For invertebrates\u00a0<i>(Daphnia magna)\u00a0</i>the EC50 48 h = 4,580 mg/l and fish appeared to be the least sensitive with a LC50 96h = 7,960 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Pimephales promelas</i>. Activated sludge showed a very low sensitivity to sodium sulfate. There was no effect up to 8 g/l. Sodium sulfate is not very toxic to terrestrial plants.\u00a0<i>Picea banksiana\u00a0</i>was the most sensitive species, an effect was seen at 1.4 g/l. Sediment dwelling organisms were not very sensitive either, with an LC50 96h = 660 mg/l for\u00a0<i>Trycorythus sp</i>. Overall it can be concluded that sodium sulfate has no acute adverse effect on aquatic and sediment dwelling organisms. Toxicity to terrestrial plants is also low.</p> <p>No data were found for long term toxicity. The acute studies all show a toxicity of sodium sulfate higher than 100 mg/l, no bioaccumulation is expected,</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">For\r\naluminium and its compounds and salts:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Despite\r\nits prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium salts\r\nmetabolically. In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated\r\nby plants and animals.Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or\r\notherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental\r\nfate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminium\r\noccurs in the environment in the form of silicates, oxides and hydroxides,\r\ncombined with other elements such as sodium, fluorine and arsenic complexes\r\nwith organic matter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acidification\r\nof soils releases aluminium as a transportable solution. Mobilisation of\r\naluminium by acid rain results in aluminium becoming available for plant\r\nuptake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As an\r\nelement, aluminum cannot be degraded in the environment, but may undergo\r\nvarious precipitation or ligand exchange reactions. Aluminum in compounds has\r\nonly one oxidation state (+3), and would not undergo oxidation-reduction\r\nreactions under environmental conditions. Aluminum can be complexed by various\r\nligands present in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids). The\r\nsolubility of aluminum in the environment will depend on the ligands present\r\nand the pH.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ntrivalent aluminum ion is surrounded by six water molecules in solution. The\r\nhydrated aluminum ion, [Al(H2O)6]3+, undergoes hydrolysis, in which a stepwise\r\ndeprotonation of the coordinated water ligands forms bound hydroxide ligands\r\n(e.g., [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+, [Al(H2O)4(OH)2]+). The speciation of aluminum in water\r\nis pH dependent. The hydrated trivalent aluminum ion is the predominant form at\r\npH levels below 4. Between pH 5 and 6, the predominant hydrolysis products are\r\nAl(OH)2+ and Al(OH)2+, while the solid Al(OH)3 is most prevalent between pH 5.2\r\nand 8.8. The soluble species Al(OH)4- is the predominant species above pH 9,\r\nand is the only species present above pH 10. Polymeric aluminum hydroxides\r\nappear between pH 4.7 and 10.5, and increase in size until they are transformed\r\ninto colloidal particles of amorphous Al(OH)3, which crystallise to gibbsite in\r\nacid waters. Polymerisation is affected by the presence of dissolved silica;\r\nwhen enough silica is present, aluminum is precipitated as poorly crystallised\r\nclay mineral species.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydroxyaluminum\r\ncompounds are considered amphoteric (e.g., they can act as both acids and bases\r\nin solution). Because of this property, aluminum hydroxides can act as buffers\r\nand resist pH changes within the narrow pH range of 4-5.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Monomeric\r\naluminum compounds, typified by aluminum fluoride, chloride, and sulfate, are\r\nconsidered reactive or labile compounds, whereas polymeric aluminum species\r\nreact much more slowly in the environment. Aluminum has a stronger attraction\r\nfor fluoride in an acidic environment compared to other inorganic ligand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nadsorption of aluminum onto clay surfaces can be a significant factor in\r\ncontrolling aluminum mobility in the environment, and these adsorption\r\nreactions, measured in one study at pH 3.0-4.1, have been observed to be very\r\nrapid. However, clays may act either as a sink or a source for soluble aluminum\r\ndepending on the degree of aluminum saturation on the clay surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Within\r\nthe pH range of 5-6, aluminum complexes with phosphate and is removed from\r\nsolution. Because phosphate is a necessary nutrient in ecological systems, this\r\nimmobilization of both aluminum and phosphate may result in depleted nutrient\r\nstates in surface water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Plant\r\nspecies and cultivars of the same species differ considerably in their ability\r\nto take up and translocate aluminum to above-ground parts. Tea leaves may\r\ncontain very high concentrations of aluminum, &gt;5,000 mg/kg in old leaves.\r\nOther plants that may contain high levels of aluminum include Lycopodium\r\n(Lycopodiaceae), a few ferns, Symplocos (Symplocaceae), and Orites\r\n(Proteaceae). Aluminum is often taken up and concentrated in root tissue. In\r\nsub-alpine ecosystems, the large root biomass of the Douglas fir, <i>Abies\r\namabilis</i>, takes up aluminum and immobilizes it, preventing large\r\naccumulation in above-ground tissue. It is unclear to what extent aluminum is\r\ntaken up into root food crops and leafy vegetables. An uptake factor\r\n(concentration of aluminum in the plant/concentration of aluminum in soil) of\r\n0.004 for leafy vegetables and 0.00065 for fruits and tubers has been reported,\r\nbut the pH and plant species from which these uptake factors were derived are\r\nunclear. Based upon these values, however, it is clear that aluminum is not\r\ntaken up in plants from soil, but is instead biodiluted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Aluminum\r\nconcentrations in rainbow trout from an alum-treated lake, an untreated lake,\r\nand a hatchery were highest in gill tissue and lowest in muscle. Aluminum\r\nresidue analyses in brook trout have shown that whole-body aluminum content\r\ndecreases as the fish advance from larvae to juveniles. These results imply\r\nthat the aging larvae begin to decrease their rate of aluminum uptake, to\r\neliminate aluminum at a rate that exceeds uptake, or to maintain approximately\r\nthe same amount of aluminum while the body mass increases. The decline in\r\nwhole-body aluminum residues in juvenile brook trout may be related to growth\r\nand dilution by edible muscle tissue that accumulated less aluminum than did\r\nthe other tissues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\ngreatest fraction of the gill-associated aluminum was not sorbed to the gill\r\ntissue, but to the gill mucus. It is thought that mucus appears to retard\r\naluminum transport from solution to the membrane surface, thus delaying the\r\nacute biological response of the fish. It has been reported that concentrations\r\nof aluminum in whole-body tissue of the Atlantic salmon exposed to high\r\nconcentrations of aluminum ranging from 3 ug/g (for fish exposed to 33 ug/L) to\r\n96 ug/g (for fish exposed to 264 ug/L) at pH 5.5. After 60 days of exposure,\r\nBCFs ranged from 76 to 190 and were directly related to the aluminum exposure\r\nconcentration. In acidic waters (pH 4.6-5.3) with low concentrations of calcium\r\n(0.5-1.5 mg Ca/L), labile aluminum between 25 and 75 ug/L is toxic. Because\r\naluminum is toxic to many aquatic species, it is not bioaccumulated to a\r\nsignificant degree (BCF &lt;300) in most fish and shellfish; therefore,\r\nconsumption of contaminated fish does not appear to be a significant source of\r\naluminum exposure in humans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Bioconcentration\r\nof aluminum has also been reported for several aquatic invertebrate species.\r\nBCF values ranging from 0.13 to 0.5 in the whole-body were reported for the\r\nsnail.

Fish are generally more sensitive to aluminium than\r\naquatic invertebrates. Aluminium is a gill toxicant to fish, causing both\r\nionoregulatory and respiratory effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The\r\nbioavailability and toxicity of aluminium is generally greatest in acid\r\nsolutions. Aluminium in acid habitats has been observed to be toxic to fish and\r\nphytoplankton. Aluminium is generally more toxic over the pH range 4.4.5.4,\r\nwith a maximum toxicity occurring around pH 5.0.5.2. The inorganic single unit\r\naluminium species (Al(OH)2 +) is thought to be the most toxic. Under very acid\r\nconditions, the toxic effects of the high H+ concentration appear to be more\r\nimportant than the effects of low concentrations of aluminium; at approximately\r\nneutral pH values, the toxicity of aluminium is greatly reduced. The solubility\r\nof aluminium is also enhanced under alkaline conditions, due to its amphoteric\r\ncharacter, and some researchers found that the acute toxicity of aluminium\r\nincreased from pH 7 to pH 9. However, the opposite relationship was found in\r\nother studies. The uptake and toxicity of aluminium in freshwater organisms\r\ngenerally decreases with increasing water hardness under acidic, neutral and\r\nalkaline conditions. Complexing agents such as fluoride, citrate and humic\r\nsubstances reduce the availability of aluminium to organisms, resulting in\r\nlower toxicity. Silicon can also reduce aluminium toxicity to fish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Drinking\r\nWater Standards:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">aluminium:\r\n200 ug/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">200 ug/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">chloride:\r\n400 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">250 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">fluoride:\r\n1.5 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">1.5 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">nitrate:\r\n50 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">50 mg/l\r\n(WHO guideline)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">sulfate:\r\n250 mg/l (UK max.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil\r\nGuideline: none available.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Air\r\nQuality Standards: none available.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>The concentration of dust, for application of respirable dust limits, is to be determined from the fraction that penetrates a separator whose size collection efficiency is described by a cumulative log-normal function with a median aerodynamic diameter of 4.0 um (+-) 0.3 um and with a geometric standard deviation of 1.5 um (+-) 0.1 um, i.e..generally less than 5 um.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Chronic symptoms may include decreased vital lung capacity, chest infections</p> <p>Repeated exposures, in an occupational setting, to high levels of fine- divided dusts may produce a condition known as pneumoconiosis which is the lodgement of any inhaled dusts in the lung irrespective of the effect. This is particularly true when a significant number of particles less than 0.5 microns (1/50,000 inch), are present. Lung shadows are seen in the X-ray. Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss. As the disease progresses the cough produces a stringy mucous, vital capacity decreases further and shortness of breath becomes more severe. Other signs or symptoms include altered breath sounds, diminished lung capacity, diminished oxygen uptake during exercise, emphysema and pneumothorax (air in lung cavity) as a rare complication.</p> <p>Removing workers from possibility of further exposure to dust generally leads to halting the progress of the lung abnormalities. Where worker-exposure potential is high, periodic examinations with emphasis on lung dysfunctions should be undertaken</p> <p>Dust inhalation over an extended number of years may produce pneumoconiosis.. Pneumoconiosis is the accumulation of dusts in the lungs and the tissue reaction in its presence. It is further classified as being of noncollagenous or collagenous types. Noncollagenous pneumoconiosis, the benign form, is identified by minimal stromal reaction, consists mainly of reticulin fibres, an intact alveolar architecture and is potentially reversible.</p>|Chronic symptoms include decreased vital lung capacity and chest infections.",

                "StorageIncompatability": "<ul> <li>Activated carbon, when exposed to air, represents a potential fire hazard due to a high surface area and adsorptive capacity. Freshly prepared material may ignite spontaneously in the presence of air especially at high humidity. Spontaneous combustion in air may occur at 90-100 deg. C. The presence of moisture in air facilitates the ignition. Drying oils and oxidising oils promote spontaneous heating and ignition; contamination with these must be avoided. Unsaturated drying oils (linseed oil etc.) may ignite following adsorption owing to an enormous increase in the surface area of oil exposed to air; the rate of oxidation may also be catalysed by metallic impurities in the carbon. A similar, but slower effect occurs on fibrous materials such as cotton waste. Spontaneous heating of activated carbon is related to the composition and method of preparation of the activated carbon. Free radicals, present in charcoal, are responsible for autoignition. Self-heating and autoignition may also result from adsorption of various vapours and gases (especially oxygen). For example, activated carbon auto- ignites in flowing air at 452-518 deg. C.; when the base, triethylenediamine, is adsorbed on the carbon (5%) the autoignition temperature is reduced to 230-260 deg. C.. An exotherm is produced at 230-260 deg. C., at high flow rates of air, although ignition did not occur until 500 deg. C.. Mixtures of sodium borohydride with activated carbons, in air, promote the oxidation of sodium borohydride, producing a self-heating reaction that may result in the ignition of charcoal and in the production of hydrogen through thermal decomposition of the borohydride.\u00a0</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Avoid reaction with oxidising agents\u00a0</li> </ul>",

Symptoms of pneumoconiosis may include a progressive dry cough, shortness of breath on exertion (exertional dyspnea), increased chest expansion, weakness and weight loss.

Several other\r\nstudies provide conflicting evidence. Early studies in the former USSR and\r\nEastern Europe report respiratory diseases amongst workers exposed to carbon\r\nblack, including bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema and rhinitis. These studies\r\nare of questionable validity due to inadequate study design and methodology,\r\nlack of appropriate controls for cigarette smoking and other confounding\r\nfactors such as concurrent exposure to carbon dioxide, coal oil and petroleum\r\nvapours. Moreover, review of these studies indicates that the concentrations of\r\ncarbon black were greater than current occupational standards.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black may cause adverse pulmonary changes following\r\nprolonged or repeated inhalation of the dust; these include oral mucosal\r\nlesions, bronchitis and pneumoconiosis which may lead to lung tumours.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The body of evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies\r\ncomes from two chronic inhalation studies and two intratracheal instillation\r\nstudies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in\r\nexposed animals. An inhalation study was tested on mice, but did not show\r\nsignificantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic\r\ndata comes from three different cohort studies of carbon black production\r\nworkers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000\r\nworkers in each study group, showed elevated mortality from lung cancer in the\r\ncarbon black workers. Another study of over 5,000 workers in the United States\r\ndid not show elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers.\r\nNewer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK\r\nstudy may suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However,\r\na more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis\r\nthat carbon black acts as a late-stage carcinogen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In studies employing channel and furnace black, hamsters,\r\nmice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys exposed to dusts for 7 hours/day, 5\r\ndays/week, at concentrations of 87.4 mg/m3 for channel black and 56.5 mg/m3 for\r\nfurnace black, no malignancies were observed in any of the animals. Channel\r\nblack had little if any absorbed polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (as benzene\r\nextractables) whilst furnace black had 0.28%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Several findings have strengthened the association between\r\ninflammation and cancer and between the particle surface area dose of carbon\r\nblack and other\u00a0 poorly soluble low toxicity (PSLT) particles and the pulmonary\r\ninflammation response in mice and the proinflammatory effects in lung cells in\r\nvitro. Other evidence suggests that in addition to a cancer mechanism involving\r\nindirect genotoxicity through inflammation and oxidative stress, nanoparticles\r\nmay act as direct carcinogens .</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carbon black appears to act like PSLT particles, which can\r\nelicit lung tumours in rats following prolonged exposure to sufficiently high\r\nconcentrations of particles. Particle surface area dose was found to be most\r\npredictive of pulmonary inflammation and tumour response in rats when comparing\r\nthe dose-response relationships for various types and sizes of PSLT including\r\ncarbon black. Compared to fine PSLT, much lower concentrations of ultrafine\r\nPSLT (e.g. 2.5, 6.5 or 11.5 mg/m3 carbon black and ~10 mg/m3 ultrafine titanium\r\ndioxide) were associated with impaired clearance, persistent inflammation, and\r\nmalignant lung tumours in chronic inhalation studies in rats. Most evidence\r\nsuggests that carbon black and other PSLT-elicited lung tumours occurs through\r\na secondary genotoxic mechanism, involving chronic inflammation and oxidative\r\nstress. Experimental studies have shown that when the particle lung dose\r\nreaches a sufficiently high concentration (e.g.,mass dose of ~0.5 mg fine-sized\r\nPSLT/g lung in rats), the alveolar macrophage-medicated clearance process\r\nbegins to be impaired (complete impairment occurs at ~10 mg/g lung. Overloading\r\nof lung clearance is accompanied by pulmonary inflammation, leading to\r\nincreased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, depletion of\r\nantioxidants and/or impairment of other defense mechanisms, cell injury, cell\r\nproliferation, fibrosis, and as seen in rats,\u00a0 induction of mutations and\r\neventually cancer. Rats appear to be more sensitive to carbon black and other\r\nPSLT than other rodent species. Although studies in humans have not shown a\r\ndirect link between inhaled PSLT and lung cancer, many of the steps in the\r\nmechanism observed in rats have also been observed in humans who work in dusty\r\njobs, including increased particle lung retention and pulmonary inflammation in\r\nworkers exposed to coal dust or crystalline silica and elevated lung cancer has\r\nbeen observed in some studies of workers exposed to carbon black, crystalline\r\nsilica, and diesel exhaust particles</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Monkeys exposed to channel black for 1000-1500 hours showed\r\nevidence of electrocardiac changes indicative of right atrial and right\r\nventricular strain. These changes increased progressively until after 10,000\r\nhours of exposure, when the changes were marked. The authors of this study\r\nconcluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged exposure other\r\nthan those expected from the accumulation of non-toxic dusts in the pulmonary\r\nsystem. Exposure to furnace black produced a similar picture although\r\nelectrocardiographic change was first observed in monkeys after 2500 hours'\r\nexposure and marked atrial and right ventricular strain after 10,000 hours' exposure.\r\nThe authors concluded that there was no significant effect due to prolonged\r\nexposure other than those expected from the accumulation of nontoxic dusts in\r\nthe pulmonary system.

The activity of some carcinogens appear to be inhibited by\r\ncarbon black itself.</p>",
