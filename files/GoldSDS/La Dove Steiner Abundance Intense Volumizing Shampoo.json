                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Upon this release a biocidal substance can pass a sewage\r\ntreatment plant (STP) and, based on its physical chemical properties, partition\r\nto sewage sludge, which in turn can be used for soil amendments thereby\r\nreleasing the substance into the soil compartment. Alternatively, the substance\r\ncan remain in the water phase in the STP and subsequently end up in the water\r\ncompartment such as surface water etc. Risk assessment for the environment\r\nfocuses on protecting the environmental compartments (air, water and soil) by\r\nperforming hazard assessments on key species, which represent the food chain\r\nwithin the specific compartment. Of special concern is a well functioning STP,\r\nwhich is elemental in many removal processes. The large variety in biocidal\r\napplications leads to complicated exposure scenarios that need to reflect the\r\nintended use and possible degradation pathways, in order to perform an accurate\r\nrisk assessment for the environment.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>CEL TWA: 0.1 mg/m3; STEL 0.3 mg/m3 total isothiazolinones (Rohm and Haas)</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may produce toxic effects.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Although the material is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may cause transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn). Slight abrasive damage may also result. The material may produce foreign body irritation in certain individuals.</p> <p>Direct contact with alkaline corrosives may produce pain and burns. Oedema, destruction of the epithelium, corneal opacification and iritis may occur. In less severe cases these symptoms tend to resolve. In severe injuries the full extent of the damage may not be immediately apparent with late complications comprising a persistent oedema, vascularisation and corneal scarring, permanent opacity, staphyloma, cataract, symblepharon and loss of sight.</p> <p>Solutions containing isothiazolinones may produce corrosion of the mucous membranes and cornea. Instillation of 0.1 ml of an aqueous solution containing 560 ppm isothiazolinone into rabbit eye did not produce irritation whereas concentrations, typically around 3% and 5.5 %, were severely irritating or corrosive to the eye.. Symptoms included clouding of the cornea, chemosis and swelling of the eyelids.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may produce toxic effects; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>The material is not thought to be a skin irritant (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Abrasive damage however, may result from prolonged exposures. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Skin contact with alkaline corrosives may produce severe pain and burns; brownish stains may develop. The corroded area may be soft, gelatinous and necrotic; tissue destruction may be deep.</p> <p>Aqueous solutions of isothiazolinones may be irritating or even corrosive depending on concentration. Solutions containing more than 0.5% (5000 ppm active substance) may produce severe irritation of human skin whilst solutions containing more than 100 ppm may irritate the skin.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Isothiazolinones are moderately to highly toxic by oral administration.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Practical experience shows that\r\nskin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation\r\nreaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive\r\nresponse in experimental animals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances that can cause\r\noccupational asthma (also known as asthmagens and respiratory sensitisers) can\r\ninduce a state of specific airway hyper-responsiveness via an immunological,\r\nirritant or other mechanism. Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><font color=\"#292526\">The isothiazolinones are known contact sensitisers. Data are presented which demonstrate that, in comparison with the chlorinated and dichlorinated compounds which share immunological cross-reactivity, the non-chlorinated isothiazolinones have a lower potential for sensitization and no documented immunological cross-reaction with the chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font>The risk of sensitization depends on how contact with the product occurs. The risk is greater when the skin barrier has been damaged and smaller when the skin is healthy. Dermatological studies have demonstrated that mixed isothiazolinone concentrations below 20 ppm may cause sensitisation and that allergic reactions can be provoked in sensitized persons even with concentrations in the range of 7-15 ppm active isothiazolinones.</p> <p><font color=\"#292526\">The isothiazolinones are a group of heterocyclic sulfur-containing compounds. \u00a0In general all are electrophilic molecules containing an activated N-S bond that enables them with nucleophilic cell entities, thus exerting biocidal activity.

Negative results were obtained in studies of the DNA-damaging potential of mixed isothiazolinones (Kathon) in mammalian cells\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0and of cytogenetic effects and DNA-binding\u00a0<i>in vivo.</i>\u00a0 The addition of rat liver S-9 (metabolic activation) reduced toxicity but did not eliminate mutagenicity. These compounds bind to the proteins in the S-9. At higher concentrations of Kathon the increase in mutagenicity may be due to an excess of unbound active compounds.</p> <p>A study of cutaneous application of Kathon CG in 30 months, three times per week at a concentration of 400 ppm (0.04%) a.i. had no local or systemic tumourigenic effect in male mice. No dermal or systemic carcinogenic potential was observed.</p> <p>Reproduction and teratogenicity studies with rats, given isothiazolinone doses of 1.4-14 mg/kg/day orally from day 6 to day 15 of gestation, showed no treatment related effects in either the dams or in the foetuses</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Upon this release a biocidal substance can pass a sewage\r\ntreatment plant (STP) and, based on its physical chemical properties, partition\r\nto sewage sludge, which in turn can be used for soil amendments thereby\r\nreleasing the substance into the soil compartment. Alternatively, the substance\r\ncan remain in the water phase in the STP and subsequently end up in the water\r\ncompartment such as surface water etc. Risk assessment for the environment\r\nfocuses on protecting the environmental compartments (air, water and soil) by\r\nperforming hazard assessments on key species, which represent the food chain\r\nwithin the specific compartment. Of special concern is a well functioning STP,\r\nwhich is elemental in many removal processes. The large variety in biocidal\r\napplications leads to complicated exposure scenarios that need to reflect the\r\nintended use and possible degradation pathways, in order to perform an accurate\r\nrisk assessment for the environment.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>CEL TWA: 0.1 mg/m3; STEL 0.3 mg/m3 total isothiazolinones (Rohm and Haas)</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented. Where this is not possible the primary aim is to apply adequate\r\nstandards of control to prevent workers from becoming hyper-responsive. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Activities giving rise to\r\nshort-term peak concentrations should receive particular attention when risk\r\nmanagement is being considered. Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p><font color=\"#292526\">The isothiazolinones are known contact sensitisers. Data are presented which demonstrate that, in comparison with the chlorinated and dichlorinated compounds which share immunological cross-reactivity, the non-chlorinated isothiazolinones have a lower potential for sensitization and no documented immunological cross-reaction with the chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font>The risk of sensitization depends on how contact with the product occurs. The risk is greater when the skin barrier has been damaged and smaller when the skin is healthy. Dermatological studies have demonstrated that mixed isothiazolinone concentrations below 20 ppm may cause sensitisation and that allergic reactions can be provoked in sensitized persons even with concentrations in the range of 7-15 ppm active isothiazolinones.</p> <p><font color=\"#292526\">The isothiazolinones are a group of heterocyclic sulfur-containing compounds. \u00a0In general all are electrophilic molecules containing an activated N-S bond that enables them with nucleophilic cell entities, thus exerting biocidal activity. A vinyl activated chlorine atom makes\u00a0</font>allows to molecule to exert greater antimicrobial efficiency but at the same time produces a greater potential for sensitisation.</p> <p><font color=\"#292526\">\u00a0Several conclusions relating to the sensitising characteristics of the isothiazolinones may therefore be drawn* :</font></p> <ul> <li><font color=\"#292526\">The strongest sensitisers are the chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font></li> <li><font color=\"#292526\">There are known immunological cross-reactions between at least 2 different chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font></li> <li><font color=\"#292526\">There appears to be no immunological cross reaction between non-chlorinated isothiazolinones and chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font></li> <li><font color=\"#292526\">Although classified as sensitisers, the nonchlorinated isothiazolinones are considerably less potent sensitisers than are the chlorinated isothiazolinones.\u00a0</font></li> <li><font color=\"#292526\">By avoiding the use of chlorinated isothiazolinones, the potential to induce sensitisation is greatly reduced.\u00a0</font></li> <li><font color=\"#292526\">Despite a significant percentage of the population having been previously sensitised to chlorinated and non-chlorinated species, \u00a0it is likely that careful and judicious use of non-chlorinated isothiazolinones will result in reduced risk of allergic reactions in those persons.\u00a0</font></li> <li><font color=\"#292526\">Although presently available data promise that several non-chlorinated isothiazolinones will offer effective antimicrobial protection in industrial and personal care products, it is only with the passage of time that proof of their safety in use or otherwise will become available.\u00a0</font></li> </ul> <p><font color=\"#292526\">* B.R. Alexander: Contact Dermatitis 2002, 46, pp 191-196\u00a0</font></p> <p>Although there have been conflicting reports in the literature, it has been reported by several investigators that isothiazolinones are mutagenic in\u00a0<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>\u00a0strains (Ames test). Negative results were obtained in studies of the DNA-damaging potential of mixed isothiazolinones (Kathon) in mammalian cells\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0and of cytogenetic effects and DNA-binding\u00a0<i>in vivo.</i>\u00a0 The addition of rat liver S-9 (metabolic activation) reduced toxicity but did not eliminate mutagenicity. These compounds bind to the proteins in the S-9. At higher concentrations of Kathon the increase in mutagenicity may be due to an excess of unbound active compounds.</p> <p>A study of cutaneous application of Kathon CG in 30 months, three times per week at a concentration of 400 ppm (0.04%) a.i. had no local or systemic tumourigenic effect in male mice. No dermal or systemic carcinogenic potential was observed.</p> <p>Reproduction and teratogenicity studies with rats, given isothiazolinone doses of 1.4-14 mg/kg/day orally from day 6 to day 15 of gestation, showed no treatment related effects in either the dams or in the foetuses</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p>",
