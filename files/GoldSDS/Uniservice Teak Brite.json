                "Environment": "<p>For oxalic acid and oxalate salts</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>If released to soil, oxalic acid under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) will be in the form of the oxalate ion (pKa1 and pKa2 of 1.25 and 4.28, respectively) and is expected to leach in soil. Photolysis is expected to be an important fate process; the daytime persistence of oxalic acid and oxalates on soil surfaces is not expected to exceed a few hours. Based upon screening biodegradation tests, biodegradation in soil is expected to be important. No experimental data are available to determine whether the oxalate ion will adsorb to sediment or soil more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. If released to water, oxalic acid/ oxalates will not volatilise, adsorb to sediment, bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, oxidise or hydrolyse. Oxalic acid, however, may act as a leaching agent for those metals that form soluble oxalate complexes, including Al and Fe. This may result in the release of metals which may otherwise be strongly adsorbed to soils.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on an average experimental water solubility of 220,000 mg/L at 25 deg C and a regression derived equation, the BCF for oxalic acid can be estimated to be approximately 0.6 and therefore should not be expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The predominant aquatic fate processes are expected to be photolysis in surface waters and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. If released to the atmosphere, removal from air via wet deposition, dry deposition, and photolysis is likely to occur. Exposure of the general population to oxalic acid/ oxalates is expected to occur through consumption of foods in which it is naturally contained, inhalation of contaminated air, and consumption of contaminated groundwater.</p> <p>Oxalic acid is a metabolite of ethylene glycol, which in turn is a metabolite of ethylene oxide. In assessing the aggregate exposure to oxalic acid, the residues of ethylene glycol and ethylene oxide must be considered. Food uses of ethylene oxide are thought result in insignificant exposure to drinking water resources. Ethyene oxide does not persist in the environment because it is reactive and degrades by biotic and abiotic processes. Ethylene glycol also breaks down rapidly in air, soils and water and is not expected to bioaccumulate in the environment or foodstuffs. Therefore these metabolites are not expected to contribute significantly to aggregate exposure.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|log Kow : -0.81- -0.43|BOD 5 : 0.086-0.14|COD : 0.126-0.18|ThOD : 0.18|Fish LC50 (24 h): 4000 mg/L",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Acidic corrosives produce respiratory tract irritation with coughing, choking and mucous membrane damage. Symptoms of exposure may include dizziness, headache, nausea and weakness. In more severe exposures, pulmonary oedema may be evident either immediately or after a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms of pulmonary oedema include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum and cyanosis. Examination may reveal hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rates. Death, due to anoxia, may occur several hours after onset of the pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Inhalation of oxalic acid dusts or vapours can cause ulceration of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat, epistaxis (nosebleed), headache and nervousness. The airborne dust behaves as a strong acid producing severe local burns of the mucous membranes.</p> <p>Inhalation of soluble oxalates produces irritation of the respiratory tract. Systemic effects may include protein in the urine (albuminuria), ulceration of the mucous membranes, headaches, nervousness, cough, vomiting, emaciation, back pain (due to kidney injury) and weakness.</p> <p>Inhalation of soluble oxalates over a long period of time might result in weight loss and respiratory tract inflammation.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct eye contact with acid corrosives may produce pain, lachrymation, photophobia and burns. Mild burns of the epithelia generally recover rapidly and completely. Severe burns produce long-lasting and possible irreversible damage. The appearance of the burn may not be apparent for several weeks after the initial contact. The cornea may ultimately become deeply vascularised and opaque resulting in blindness.</p> <p>Dilute solutions of low-molecular organic acids cause conjunctival hyperaemia, prompt pain and corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Skin contact with acidic corrosives may result in pain and burns; these may be deep with distinct edges and may heal slowly with the formation of scar tissue.</p> <p>Solutions of 5% to 10% oxalic acid are irritating to the skin after prolonged contact; early gangrene may occur after hand immersion in oxalate solutions.</p> <p>Oxalate ion is an irritant and may cause dermatitis. Following contact skin lesions may develop. Epithelial cracking and slow-healing ulceration may follow.They fingers may appears cyanotic.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Solution of material in moisture on the skin, or perspiration, may increase irritant effects</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ingestion of acidic corrosives may produce circumoral burns with a distinct discolouration of the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. Immediate pain and difficulties in swallowing and speaking may also be evident. Oedema of the epiglottis may produce respiratory distress and possibly, asphyxia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a pronounced thirst may occur. More severe exposures may produce a vomitus containing fresh or dark blood and large shreds of mucosa. Shock, with marked hypotension, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may be symptomatic of the exposure. Circulatory collapse may, if left untreated, result in renal failure. Severe cases may show gastric and oesophageal perforation with peritonitis, fever and abdominal rigidity. Stricture of the oesophageal, gastric and pyloric sphincter may occur as within several weeks or may be delayed for years. Death may be rapid and often results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Delayed deaths may be due to peritonitis, severe nephritis or pneumonia. Coma and convulsions may be terminal.</p> <p>Oxalic acid is a minor, normal body constituent occurring in blood at approximately 0.150 mg/100 ml and in kidney, muscle and liver at about 0.050 mg/100 ml dry weight, but higher concentrations are toxic.</p> <p>Ingestion of 5 grams has caused death within hours. It is a systemic poison which affects the central nervous system and kidney function. Low doses (i.e. excess in blood) may cause hypocalcemia (presence in the blood of an abnormally low concentration of calcium).</p> <p>Oxalic acid occurs naturally in the common weed Oxalis, `sour sobs'.</p> <p>Ingestion of low-molecular organic acid solutions may produce spontaneous haemorrhaging, intravascular coagulation, gastrointestinal damage and oesophageal and pyloric stricture.</p> <p>Soluble or solubilised oxalates act as severe corrosive agents within the alimentary tract and may be lethal as a result of severe gastroenteritis and secondary shock. Ingestion of concentrated solutions has produced severe gastrointestinal irritation, haematemesis (blood in the vomitus), central nervous system and cardiac depression and death. Dilute solutions produce little gastrointestinal distress but may produce weakness, muscular twitching, and on occasion, coma and death.Where gastrointestinal symptoms are absent (as is the case with dilute solutions) systemic effects may dominate resulting in cramps and central nervous system depression.</p> <p>Neuromuscular effects are the result of the calcium-complexing action of oxalate and the subsequent depression of body fluid calcium ion. This form of hypocalcaemia is thought to produce severe disturbances in heart and brain function. Calcium oxalate also deposits in the soft tissues of the kidney and liver and may result in renal damage with the development of lesions and mechanical injury.</p> <p>Symptoms of poisoning may include vomiting (often bloody with coffee-ground appearance), pain, weak, irregular pulse, headache, muscular cramp, tetany and, sometimes, convulsion, stupor and coma. Oliguria, albuminuria and haematuria may persist for several weeks as a result of kidney damage.</p> <p>The mean lethal dose of soluble oxalates in adults is estimated to be 10-30 grams (143-428 mg/kg) with death within a few hours or even minutes.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for human fertility, on the basis that similar materials provide some evidence of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Chronic exposure to oxalates may result in circulatory failure or nervous system irregularities may follow prolonged calcium metabolism due to oxalation. Sharp reduction of serum calcium, following exposure, can cause dysfunction of head and brain. \u00a0Calcium may be deposited in the liver and kidneys leading to damage.</p> <p>Circulatory failure or nervous system irregularities may follow prolonged calcium metabolism disturbances</p> <p>Prolonged and severe exposure can cause chronic cough, albuminuria, vomiting, pain in the back and gradual emaciation and weakness. Prolonged or repeated overexposure may result in delayed liver and/or kidney damage.</p> <p>Certain rare individuals are subject to oxalosis (deposition of oxalates in the kidneys) and are unusually reactive to any exposure.</p> <p>Rats administered oxalic acid at 2.5 and 5% in the diet for 70 days developed depressed thyroid function and weight loss. A study of railroad car cleaners in Norway who were heavily exposed to oxalic acid solutions and vapors revealed a 53% prevalence of urolithiasis (the formation of urinary stones), compared to a rate of 12% among unexposed workers from the same company.</p> <p>In a multigeneration study in mice, toxic effects in pups were seen only at maternally toxic doses.</p> <p>Oxalic acid is negative for genotoxicity in reverse mutation assays.</p>",
