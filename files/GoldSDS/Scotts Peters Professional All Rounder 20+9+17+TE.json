Nitrate can contaminate groundwater to unacceptable levels. Nitrite is formed from nitrate or ammonium ion by micro-organisms in soil, water, sewage and the alimentary tract. The concern with nitrate in the environment is related to its conversion to nitrite.</p> <p>\u00a0Methaemoglobinaemia is caused following exposure to high levels of nitrite and produces difficulties in oxygen transport in the blood. Thousands of cases involving poisoning of infants, particularly in rural areas, have been reported as a result of drinking nitrate rich well-water.</p> <p>\u00a0Other concerns deriving from exposure to environmental nitrates relate to the production of nitrosamines following the reaction of food nitrites and secondary amines. Other nitroso-compounds may result following reaction with nitrites and amides, ureas, carbamates and other nitrogenous compounds. Nitrosamines produce liver damage, haemorrhagic lung lesions, convulsions and coma in rats, and teratogenic effects in experimental animals.</p> <p>\u00a0The N-nitroso class of compounds include potent carcinogens and mutagens: induction of tumors by single doses of N-nitroso compounds testify to this.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Serious poisonings are characterised by blood disorders, anaemia and nephritis.|51r22<p>The principal concern with exposure to inorganic nitrate is its biological reduction to reactive and toxic nitrite. Nitrate itself is relatively harmless. Where bacteria are present and the environment is anaerobic, nitrate can be reduced to nitrite. The main site for this reaction is mouth and stomach, but nitrite formation in the lower intestine and in the bladder (urinary infection) may also be of some toxicological importance.</p>\n<p>Adults have tolerated large doses of nitrate as sodium and ammonium salt (&gt; 100 mg NO3-/kg) in some cases repeated for several days for medical or experimental purposes with only minor effects in some subjects (light methaemoglobinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting). Death and severe effects of nitrate ingestion are generally associated with doses above 10 g NO3-. Doses between 2 and 9 g NO3- have been reported to cause methaemoglobinaemia. These values correspond to 33 to 150 mg NO3-/kg</p>\n<p>The half-life in the body for an oral dose of nitrate to be approximately 5 hours. As blood absorption depends on food matrix and route of exposure, and as larger doses may increase the urinary excretion rate, the biological half-life for both nitrate and nitrite should be expected to be 3 to 8 hours.Nitrate does not accumulate in the body.</p>\n<p>The major acute toxic effect of nitrate and nitrite poisoning is methaemoglobinaemia.</p> <p>The lethal oral dose of nitrite for adults has been variously reported to be between 0.7 and 6 g NO2- (approximately 10 to 100 mg NO2-/kg). Lower doses may apply for children (especially neonates), the elderly and people with certain enzyme deficiencies. The first symptoms of oral nitrite poisoning develop within 15 to 45 minutes</p>\n<p>In humans, inorganic nitrites produce smooth muscle relaxation, methaemoglobinaemia and cyanosis.The primary effect of nitrite intoxication in animals is methaemoglobinaemia whilst secondary effects include vasodilation, relaxation of smooth muscle and lowering of blood pressure. Other nitrite-induced toxic effects include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, atrophied intestinal villi and apoptotic cell death in the intestinal crypts. Nitrite may also cause sudden fall in blood pressure due to its vasodilating properties.Nitrite has vasodilating properties, probably through transformation into nitric oxide (NO) or a NO-containing molecule acting as a signal factor for smooth muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p>Fatal poisonings in infants, resulting from ingestion of nitrates in water or spinach, have been reported.</p>\n<p>When sodium nitrite was administered in drinking water for 6 weeks (0.06-1%), mice showed a slight degeneration and spotty necrosis of hepatocytes and haemosiderin deposition in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, indicating haemolysis. At 2%, mice died within 3 weeks. In rats, subject to the same treatment regime, abnormal blood and spleen colours, due to MHG, were seen in 0.5% and 1.0% treatment groups. Hepatic microsomal lipoperoxidation (as measured by malondialdehyde formation) was increased in male rats given 0.2% sodium nitrite in drinking water. Liver lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase aaand cathepsin) and superoxide dismutase activities were also increased. This data suggests that the nitrite stimulates generation of superoxide radicals in the liver causing damage to cellular and subcellular membranes. Decreased plasma vitamin E and greater reduced glutathione-per erythrocyte were also reported in male rats receiving sodium nitrite in drinking water.</p> <p>The substance and/or its metabolites may bind to haemoglobin inhibiting normal uptake of oxygen. This condition, known as \"methaemoglobinemia\", is a form of oxygen starvation (anoxia).</p> <p>\u00a0Symptoms include cyanosis (a bluish discolouration skin and mucous membranes) and breathing difficulties. Symptoms may not be evident until several hours after exposure.</p> <p>\u00a0At about 15% concentration of blood methaemoglobin there is observable cyanosis of the lips, nose and earlobes. Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor. Above 60% symptoms include dyspnea, respiratory depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, and convulsions. Levels exceeding 70% may be fatal.\u00a0</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>An increased incidence of non-specific symptoms including headache, weakness, fatigue, anorexia and joint and muscle weakness has been reported to occur in mining and metallurgy workers exposed to 60-600 mg (as Mo).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Molybdenum is rapidly excreted from the body as the molybdate and does not accumulate in mammals.

It is also necessary for nitrogen-fixation by soil bacteria; livestock poisoning has been recorded in animals feeding on herbage containing high levels of molybdenum. Signs of molybdenum poisoning include loss of appetite, listlessness, diarrhoea and reduced growth rate. Anaemia is characteristic of molybdenum toxicity with low haemoglobin concentration and reduced red blood cell count. Livers and kidneys of severely poisoned animals show fatty degeneration. Other symptoms include achromotrichia (loss of hair pigment), testicular degeneration, poor conception and deficient lactation, dyspnoea, incoordination and irritation of the mucous membranes.</p> <p>Molybdenum depresses liver sulfide oxidase activity and the resulting sulfide accumulation leads to the formation of highly insoluble cupric sulfide and the subsequent appearance of copper deficiency.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or long-term occupational exposure is likely to produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Persons, exposed for long periods to molybdenum oxides, suffer from anaemia.\u00a0Animals exposed to certain insoluble molybdenum compounds show anorexia, diarrhoea, weight loss, listlessness, and liver and kidney damage. Molybdenum disturbs bone metabolism, giving rise to lameness, bone joint abnormalities, osteoporosis and high serum phosphatase levels.Cattle, rabbits, and chicks on high dietary levels of molybdenum exhibited deformities of joints of the extremities. Low molybdenum intake has been attributed to the high incidence of oesophageal cancer in South Africa among the Bantu of Transkei, in China and in Russia.</p> <p>Chronic exposure of workers in Russian molybdenum-copper plant resulted in a fall in the albumin/globulin ratio owing to a rise in globulins (particularly alpha-globulins) which is interpreted as evidence of liver dysfunction with hyperbilirubinaemia. Hepatotoxic effects are also found in animals given molybdenum salts with a rise in alpha-globulin levels, hypoalbuminaemia and increased serum bilirubin reported. Other reported biochemical effects include an early depletive effect on tissue nicotinamide nucleotides, hyperaminoaciduria, reduction in red blood cell life-span and hyper-thyroidism. Industrial exposure to some insoluble molybdenum compounds is thought to have resulted in an increased incidence of weakness, fatigue, anorexia, headache and joint and muscular pain. \u00a0Under the conditions of a 2-year inhalation study* there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of molybdenum trioxide in male rats, male mice and female mice based on a marginally significant positive trend of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats exposed to 10, 30 and 100 mg/m3. Exposure of male and female rats to molybdenum trioxide by inhalation resulted in increased incidences of chronic alveolar inflammation, hyaline degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (females), hyaline degeneration of the respiratory epithelium and squamous metaplasia of the epiglottis. Exposure of female and male mice to molybdenum trioxide resulted in an increased incidence of metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium, histiocyte cellular inflammation (males), hyaline degeneration of the respiratory epithelium, hyaline degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (females), squamous metaplasia of the epiglottis, and hyperplasia of the larynx.\u00a0</p> <p>Guinea pigs exposed to molybdenum trioxide dust for 1 hour daily at 250 mg/m3 showed extreme irritation. \u00a0Symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhoea, muscular incoordination and loss of hair. \u00a0Of the 51 animals exposed, 26 died after the tenth exposure. \u00a0Exposure to freshly generated MoO2 fume under about the same exposure conditions proved unexpectedly less toxic, with only 8.3% mortality compared with 51% mortality with the dust, and no mortality when the exposure level was reduced to about one-third (57 mg Mo/m3). \u00a0Explanation for this unexpected finding was felt to reside in the more rapid solution and elimination of the large surface area fume particle. [Patty's]</p> <p>Exposure of male and female rats to molybdenum trioxide resulted in the development of respiratory system lesions. In the lung, the incidence and severity of chronic alveolar inflammation increased with increasing exposure concentration in male and female rats. In some male rats, exposure to the material resulted in alveolar/ bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas. Lesions in the nose (hyaline degeneration) and larynx (squamous metaplasia) were considered to be a non-specific defensive or adaptive response to chronic inhalation exposure. Inhalation exposure of mice to molybdenum trioxide was associated with the development of lung neoplasms and an increased incidence of alveolar/ bronchiolar carcinoma or adenoma in both sexes. Chronic inflammatory lesions were not present in the lungs. Lesions of the nose and larynx were similar to those observed in rats.</p> <p>Molybdenum trioxide was not mutagenic in any of five strains of Salmonella typhimurium and did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro. All tests were conducted with or without S9 metabolic activation enzymes.</p> <p>Pneumoconiosis has been described in experimental animals exposed sub-chronically to molybdenum trioxide.</p> <p>The mechanism of molybdenum trioxide action in lung carcinogenicity is not known; the material is not mutagenic. Non-neoplastic lesions of the nose and larynx of rats and in the nose, larynx and lungs of mice were apparently due to the development of a more durable epithelium in response to chronic exposure.</p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (1) concluded that there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male F344/N rats based on a marginally significant positive trend of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma; that there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats; that there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice and that there was evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1 mice</p> <p>\u00a0National Toxicology Program: Technical Report Series 462, April 1997</p>",
