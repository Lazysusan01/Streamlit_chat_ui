Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The metabolism of thorium involves not only a consideration of the species as a chemical entity but also a consideration of some of its principal radioactive decay products (e.g. Ra(224), Ra(228), Rn(220) and Pb(212)) as radiological entities. A common characteristic of all thorium compounds is the long time that they remain in the organs in which they are deposited. Thorium is retained longest when it enters the body as insoluble compounds. These are mainly retained in the bones, lungs, glands and parenchymatous tissues.

Only after considerable periods does such illness become apparent and symptoms characteristic of chronic radiation disease occur; neoplasms may occur and immunological activity may be reduced. Chronic exposure to thorium in patients receiving injections of Thorotrast (a colloidal thorium oxide) for pyelography, has produced tumours at various sites, and confirmed in animal studies. Cancer of the liver, larynx, bronchii and sarcoma of the kidney have been reported.
