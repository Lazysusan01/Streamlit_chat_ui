                "Environment": "<p>For hydrogen peroxide:</p> <p>log Kow: -1.36</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide is a naturally occurring substance (typical background concentrations &lt; 1 - 30 g/l). Almost all cells with the exception of anaerobic bacteria produce it in their metabolism. Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive substance in the presence of other substances, elements, radiation, materials and can be degraded by micro-organisms or higher organisms.</p> <p>Air: Hydrogen peroxide may be removed from the atmosphere by photolysis giving rise to hydroxyl radicals, by reaction with hydroxyl radicals, or by heterogenous loss processes such as rain-out. Significantly higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations are found in polluted atmospheres as compared with clean air. These concentrations are believed to arise from photochemically-initiated oxidation of reactive hydrocarbons. Under severe smog conditions, daytime levels of hydrogen peroxide as high as 0.18 ppm have been reported, but atmospheric night-time levels of 2-5 ppb did not correlate to smog intensity.</p> <p>Soil: No information was found in the secondary sources searched regarding the transformation or persistence of hydrogen peroxide in soil, however, solutions of hydrogen peroxide gradually deteriorate.\u00a0</p> <p>Water: Hydrogen peroxide is a naturally occurring substance. Surface water concentrations of hydrogen peroxide have been found to vary between 51-231 mg/L, increasing both with exposure to sunlight and the presence of dissolved organic matter.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide degrades by various mechanisms, including chemical reduction and enzymatic (catalase and peroxidase) decomposition by algae, zooplankton, and bacteria. Microorganisms, especially bacteria, account for the majority of degradation, significantly more than all other chemical and biological mechanisms. The rate at which hydrogen peroxide decomposes in natural water can vary from a few minutes to more than a week, depending on numerous chemical, biological, and physical factors.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide is rapidly degraded in a biological waste water treatment plant. Hydrogen peroxide adsorbs poorly to sediment particles and is rapidly degraded, thus accumulation in the sediment is also not expected\u00a0</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide (log Kow &lt; -1) is an inorganic substance and therefore shows little potential to bioaccumulate.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h): catfish 37.4 mg/l</p> <p>Fish LC50 (24 h): mackerel 89 mg/l; chameleon gobi 155 mg/l</p> <p>Zebra mussel LC50 (28 h) 30 mg/l; (228 h): 12 mg/l\u00a0</p> <p>Ecotoxicity data show that microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, algae) and zooplankton present in aquatic ecosystems are generally less tolerant of hydrogen peroxide exposure than are fish or other vertebrates. Effects of short-term exposures on sensitive bacteria and invertebrates (e.g., Daphnia pulex<b><i>)\u00a0</i></b>have been observed at concentrations in the low mg/L (ppm) range, while effects on sensitive algae have been reported at levels less than 1.0 mg/L. Algae are the most sensitive species for hydrogen peroxide. The algal EC50 of hydrogen peroxide was 1.6-5 mg/l, while the NOEC was 0.1 mg/l. In a 21-d continuous exposure study on Daphnia\u00a0<i>magna</i>, the chronic no observable effect concentration (NOEC) for reproduction was 0.63 mg/L and the NOEC for mortality was 1.25 mg/L.</p> <p>In chronic toxicity studies with invertebrates (zebra mussels) and hydrogen peroxide shows an NOEC of 2 mg/l. The PNEC of hydrogen peroxide is equal to 10 ug/l.</p> <p>Risk mitigation is needed to ensure that use of hydrogen peroxide will not adversely impact aquatic life. An acute water quality criterion or \"benchmark\" has been determined. For hydrogen peroxide, the acute benchmark is 0.7 mg/L. This value was calculated using the extensive toxicity database for hydrogen peroxide and procedures in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance for deriving numerical national water quality criteria. The use of hydrogen peroxide in intensive aquaculture in finfish (at up to 100 mg/L for 60 minutes) and finfish eggs (at up to 1,000 mg/L for 15 minutes) is not expected to have a significant impact on the environment.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Rapid evolution of oxygen in the acid environment of the stomach (up to 10 times the volume of the ingested solution) may result in severe organ damage. Large doses are presumed to produce gastritis and oesophagitis. Cases of rupture of the colon, proctitis and ulcerative colitis have been reported following hydrogen peroxide enemas.

In experimental animals, oral administration of hydrogen peroxide causes dental, liver, kidney, stomach, and intestinal damage. Inhalation exposure to hydrogen peroxide caused skin irritation and sneezing in dogs, and high mortality in mice.</p> <p>Hydrogen peroxide added to food is affirmed to be generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA when used to treat certain foods in specified limitations [FDA 21 CFR 184.1366 (4/1/93)].

Concentrations in excess of 1% (equivalent to approximately 1.9 g/kg/day)4\u00a0resulted in pronounced weight loss and death within two weeks. In a sequential study of mice treated with 0.4% hydrogen peroxide in drinking water (equivalent to approximately 0.76 g/kg/day)5\u00a0, gastric erosion was observed at 30 days and was present consistently throughout the 108 week study period.</p> <p>Dogs exposed 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 months at an average vapour concentration of 7 ppm (9.73 mg/3 ) of 90% hydrogen peroxide, developed skin irritation, sneezing, lacrimation, and bleaching of the hair.

No significant changes in blood or urinary parameters were observed .</p> <p>Following eight 6-hour exposures to hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 79 mg/m3\u00a0(56.88 ppm), 7/9 mice died. Following exposure to hydrogen peroxide at 93 mg/m3 , 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 30 exposures, 1/10 rats died</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to acids may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>The impact of inhaled acidic agents on the respiratory tract depends upon a number of interrelated factors. These include physicochemical characteristics, e.g., gas versus aerosol; particle size (small particles can penetrate deeper into the lung); water solubility (more soluble agents are more likely to be removed in the nose and mouth). Given the general lack of information on the particle size of aerosols involved in occupational exposures to acids, it is difficult to identify their principal deposition site within the respiratory tract. Acid mists containing particIes with a diameter of up to a few micrometers will be deposited in both the upper and lower airways. They are irritating to mucous epithelia, they cause dental erosion, and they produce acute effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in pulmonary function). AsthmatIcs appear to be at particular risk for pulmonary effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",
