Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

                "FireExplosionHazard": "<ul>\n<li>Combustible solid which burns but propagates flame with difficulty; it is estimated that most organic dusts are combustible (circa 70%) - according to the circumstances under which the combustion process occurs, such materials may cause fires and / or dust explosions. </li>\n<li>Organic powders when finely divided over a range of concentrations regardless of particulate size or shape and suspended in air or some other oxidizing medium may form explosive dust-air mixtures and result in a fire or dust explosion (including secondary explosions). </li>\n<li>Avoid generating dust, particularly clouds of dust in a confined or unventilated space as dusts may form an explosive mixture with air, and any source of ignition, i.e. flame or spark, will cause fire or explosion. Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>hydrogen chloride</p> <p>phosgene</p> <p>nitrogen oxides (NOx)</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p>",

These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>These chemicals, by the nature of their surfactant properties, are toxic to aquatic organisms at low concentrations. Cationic groups such as alkylsulfoniums, alkylphosphoniums and quaternary ammonium polymers are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. Similarly potentially cationic groups such as amines and isocyanates are of concern. Some cationics, however, may fall into the category of PLCs (polymers of low concern) provided they possess low charge density, and/or are not water-soluble or are not self-dispersing polycarboxylates or poly- (aromatic or aliphatic) sulfonate polymers.</p> <p>The toxicity of quaternary ammonium compounds is known to be greatly reduced in the environment because of preferential binding to dissolved organics in surface water</p> <p><b>For alkyltrimethylammonium (ATMA) salts</b></p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Although cationic surfactants will sorb onto sludge particles and eventually reach the digester during the treatment of wastewater sludge, there is very limited information about the biodegradability of these compounds under anoxic conditions. It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.</p> <p>Very little is known about biodegradation pathways of alkyltrimethylammonium \u00a0(ATMA) salts. Two potential points of attack have been proposed. The degradation may either be initiated by a fission of the C-N bond in which the alkyl chain or a methyl group is cleaved from a tertiary amine, or by an omega-oxidation in which the far end of the alkyl chain is first oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Biodegradation can then proceed via beta-oxidation.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants. The toxicity of ATMAB and ATMAC (alkyltrimethylammonium bromide and chloride) to algae is characterized by EC50 values below 1 mg/l.</p> <p>ATMAC are acutely toxic to aquatic invertebrates as indicated by EC/LC50 values below 1 mg/l for alkyl chain lengths of C16 \u00a0exposed artificial stream mesocosms housing the freshwater clam\u00a0<i>Corbicula fluminea\u00a0</i>with C12 ATMAC. Minor and transient effects on length gain were observed at 43 ug/l during weeks 2-4 and 6-7, but these effects were not evident at the end of the experiment after 8 weeks. One study with the species\u00a0<i>Idus melatonus\u00a0</i>indicates that some ATMAC are also toxic to fish Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001. Torben Madsen et al: Miljoministeriet (Danish Environmental Protection Agency)</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>For quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs):</b></p> <p>QACs are white, crystalline powders. Low molecular weight QACs are very soluble in water, but slightly or not at all soluble in solvents such as ether, petrol and benzene. As the molecular weight and chain lengths increases, the solubility in polar solvents (e.g. water) decreases and the solubility in non-polar solvents increases.\u00a0</p> <p>  <b>Environmental fate</b></p> <p>A major part of the QACs is discharged into wastewater and removed in the biological processes of sewage treatment plant. A 90% reduction of the QACs in the water phase of sludge has been reported and alkyl di-/ trimethyl ammonium and alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium compounds seem almost completely degraded in sewage sludge.</p> <p>However, the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of QACs is not well investigated. Only sparse data are available concerning stability, solubility and biodegradability. In general, it seems that the biodegradability decreases with increasing numbers of alkyl chains: R(CH3)3N+ &gt; R2(CH3)2N+ &gt; R3(CH3)N+ . Within each category the biodegradability seems inversely proportional to the alkyl chain length. Heterocyclic QACs are less degradable than the non-cyclic.\u00a0</p> <p>Investigations have shown that bioaccumulation of considerable dimensions will probably not take place.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Quaternary ammonium compounds and their polymers may be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. The toxicity of the quaternary ammoniums is known to be greatly reduced in the environment because of preferential binding to dissolved organics in surface water.</p> <p>Although inorganic chloride ions are not normally considered toxic they can exist in effluents at acutely toxic levels (chloride &gt;3000 mg/l). \u00a0The resulting salinity can exceed the tolerances of most freshwater organisms.</p> <p>Inorganic chlorine eventually finds its way into the aqueous compartment and as such is bioavailable. Incidental exposure to inorganic chloride may occur in occupational settings where chemicals management policies are improperly applied. The toxicity of chloride salts depends on the counter-ion (cation) present; that of chloride itself is unknown. Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the special case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism, e.g. in congestive heart failure. Healthy individuals can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride provided that there is a concomitant intake of fresh water.</p> <p>Although excessive intake of drinking-water containing sodium chloride at concentrations above 2.5 g/litre has been reported to produce hypertension, this effect is believed to be related to the sodium ion concentration.</p> <p>Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/litre can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/litre. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.</p> <p>In humans, 88% of chloride is extracellular and contributes to the osmotic activity of body fluids. The electrolyte balance in the body is maintained by adjusting total dietary intake and by excretion via the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Chloride is almost completely absorbed in normal individuals, mostly from the proximal half of the small intestine. Normal fluid loss amounts to about 1.5-2 liters/day, together with about 4 g of chloride per day. Most (90 - 95%) is excreted in the urine, with minor amounts in faeces (4-8%) and sweat (2%).</p> <p>Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and thus increases its corrosivity. In metal pipes, chloride reacts with metal ions to form soluble salts thus increasing levels of metals in drinking-water. In lead pipes, a protective oxide layer is built up, but chloride enhances galvanic corrosion. It can also increase the rate of pitting corrosion of metal pipes.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>|Biodegradability (28 d): 60% approx (OECD 302 B)|Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC): 696 mg/g (DIN/ EN 1484)|Chemical oxygen demand (COD) 2.495 mg/g (ISO/ DIS 15705)|Fish LC50 (96 h): zebra fish 0.5 mg/l (OECD 203)|Bacterial EC50 (30 m): Vibrio fisheri 53.8 mg/l (DIN EN ISO 11348-2)",

Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit.

The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <ul> <li>Local exhaust ventilation is required where solids are handled as powders or crystals; even when particulates are relatively large, a certain proportion will be powdered by mutual friction.\u00a0</li> <li>Exhaust ventilation should be designed to prevent accumulation and recirculation of particulates in the workplace.\u00a0</li> <li>If in spite of local exhaust an adverse concentration of the substance in air could occur, respiratory protection should be considered. Such protection might consist of:\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>(a): particle dust respirators, if necessary, combined with an absorption cartridge;</p> <p>(b): filter respirators with absorption cartridge or canister of the right type;</p> <p>(c): fresh-air hoods or masks</p> <ul> <li>Build-up of electrostatic charge on the dust particle, may be prevented by bonding and grounding.\u00a0</li> <li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to efficiently remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The very bitter taste is likely to give early warning of accidental ingestion. Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation. Individuals who survive a period of severe hypertension may develop kidney failure. Cloudy swelling, patchy necrosis and fatty infiltration in such visceral organs as the heart, liver and kidneys shows at death.</p> <p>\u00a0Rats fed repeatedly on a similar material (a C12-C16 alkyl derivative), over several weeks, died of inanition associated with chronic diarrhoea; at autopsy the only lesion found was focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the gastric mucosa. Repeated administration of 0.5% in the diet was lethal to rats, while 25 mg/kg was lethal to dogs; toxic signs in dogs included conditioned salivation, vomiting, enteritis, pulmonary haemorrhage and inflammation and sloughing of the mucosa.\u00a0</p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Cardiovascular involvement may result in arrhythmias and hypotension. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea and vomiting. Kidney and liver damage may result following massive exposures. The alcohols are potential irritants being, generally, stronger irritants than similar organic structures that lack functional groups (e.g. alkanes) but are much less irritating than the corresponding amines, aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols and glycols (diols) rarely represent serious hazards in the workplace, because their vapour concentrations are usually less than the levels which produce significant irritation which, in turn, produce significant central nervous system effects as well.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Most liquid alcohols appear to act as primary skin irritants in humans. Significant percutaneous absorption occurs in rabbits but not apparently in man.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Effects on the nervous system characterise over-exposure to higher aliphatic alcohols. These include headache, muscle weakness, giddiness, ataxia, (loss of muscle coordination), confusion, delirium and coma. Gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In the absence of effective treatment, respiratory arrest is the most common cause of death in animals acutely poisoned by the higher alcohols. Aspiration of liquid alcohols produces an especially toxic response as they are able to penetrate deeply in the lung where they are absorbed and may produce pulmonary injury. Those possessing lower viscosity elicit a greater response. The result is a high blood level and prompt death at doses otherwise tolerated by ingestion without aspiration. In general the secondary alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding primary isomers. As a general observation, alcohols are more powerful central nervous system depressants than their aliphatic analogues. In sequence of decreasing depressant potential, tertiary alcohols with multiple substituent OH groups are more potent than secondary alcohols, which, in turn, are more potent than primary alcohols. The potential for overall systemic toxicity increases with molecular weight (up to C7), principally because the water solubility is diminished and lipophilicity is increased.</p> <p>Within the homologous series of aliphatic alcohols, narcotic potency may increase even faster than lethality</p> <p>Only scanty toxicity information is available about higher homologues of the aliphatic alcohol series (greater than C7) but animal data establish that lethality does not continue to increase with increasing chain length. Aliphatic alcohols with 8 carbons are less toxic than those immediately preceding them in the series. 10 -Carbon n-decyl alcohol has low toxicity as do the solid fatty alcohols (e.g. lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl). However the rat aspiration test suggests that decyl and melted dodecyl (lauryl) alcohols are dangerous if they enter the trachea. In the rat even a small quantity (0.2 ml) of these behaves like a hydrocarbon solvent in causing death from pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Primary alcohols are metabolised to corresponding aldehydes and acids; a significant metabolic acidosis may occur. Secondary alcohols are converted to ketones, which are also central nervous system depressants and which, in he case of the higher homologues persist in the blood for many hours. Tertiary alcohols are metabolised slowly and incompletely so their toxic effects are generally persistent.</p>|Ingestion may cause central nervous system depression characterised by headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea,  vomiting, abdominal pain and incoordination. Severe over-exposure may lead to coma and possible death due to respiratory failure. Ingestion may also cause kidney damage and|peripheral neuropathy, a progressive disorder of the nervous system, characterised by sensory and motor abnormalities, muscle spasms, weakness and pain in the arms and legs, numbness and tingling of the fingers and toes and paralysis.",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
