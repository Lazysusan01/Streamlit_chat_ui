Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

                "Environment": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide is oxidised rapidly by both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions and is removed from the atmosphere by precipitation and by dry deposition on surfaces, mainly as sulfuric acid. Because of its high vapor pressure (3,000 mm Hg at 20\u00b0C), sulfur dioxide is typically present in a gaseous phase Some of the sulfur dioxide emitted into the air moves unchanged to various surfaces including soil, water, grass, and vegetation in general.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide can be transformed into sulfuric acid or sulfates by a variety of processes. Sulfur dioxide may be oxidised to sulfur trioxide (SO3) and sulfate in air photochemically or catalytically. The oxidations generally involve homogeneous-phase reactions (oxidation in the gas phase) and heterogeneous gas-solid reactions (oxidation on the surface of particles). Gas-phase reactions include direct photochemical oxidation of sulfur dioxide and oxidation by reacting with other gases and substances, including O, O2, O3 NO, NO2NO3 N2O5 OH, hydrocarbons, or some heavy metal ions. In the direct oxidation pathway, sulfur dioxide gas molecules (at different electronically excited states due to solar irradiation) react with each other, forming SO3, which may be further oxidised by other gases or water drops to form sulfate. Reaction pathways with other gases all result in similar end products: SO3, or sulfate. Rate constants for sulfur dioxide oxidation by these gases vary from 2x 10-24 to 4x10-3 cm3 per molecule per second, with the reaction with N2O5 being the fastest. Heterogeneous gas-solid reactions include oxidation of sulfur dioxide on the surfaces of activated carbons, metal oxides, and other particles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide may be photochemically or catalytically oxidized to SO3 and sulfate in air. The oxidations generally involve homogeneous-phase reactions (oxidation in gas or liquid phase) and heterogeneous gas-solid reactions (oxidation on the surface of particles). The atmospheric residence time of sulfur dioxide is about 10 days. Photochemical oxidation involves the reaction of sulfur dioxide with reactive molecules and free radical species, and with products of O3 and alkene gases. Photochemical oxidation is thought to be initiated by absorption of solar irradiation energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide can be oxidized by OH radicals in the gas phase relatively quickly, making it a major mechanism for sulfur dioxide conversion. The conversion rates have been characterized to be &gt;l% per hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, aqueous-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide can occur in cloud, fog, rain, deliquescent aerosol particles, and in surface liquid films on these particles. Once dissolved in these droplets, sulfur dioxide may be oxidised to sulfate via a variety of mechanisms, thus forming acid rain. Such a removal mechanism is commonly termed wet deposition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide can also be removed from air by uptake of plant leaves. It is reported that direct surface uptake of sulfur dioxide is the most significant dry removal process for atmospheric sulfur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide is very soluble in water, and oceans are generally considered to be a sink for sulfur dioxide. It is also possible that oceans can be a source of sulfur dioxide if the equilibrium pressure of sulfur dioxide in surface water exceeds the partial pressure of sulfur dioxide in the air immediately above it. Any potential releases of sulfur dioxide from water would be expected to partition to the atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Dissolved sulfur dioxide in the surface layer of the ocean may be slowly oxidised to the sulfate anion (SO4 2-) by the combined presence of dissolved O2 and trace amounts of transition metal salts as catalysts. At ocean depths, dispersed sulfate may be reduced to sulfur dioxide, sulfur, and hydrogen sulfide by the action of bacteria. Sulfur dioxide absorbed by freshwater lakes is less rapidly oxidized than seawater because of the much lower salt content of freshwater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil can absorb sulfur dioxide, with uptake being dependent on the pH and moisture content of the soil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acid rain is the leading cause in an increase in heavy metal mobility in soil. When soil is basic pH, heavy metals will form insoluble oxides or hydroxides of sulfate, and when soil is acidic, soluble sulfates will form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide can be reduced to H2S in heat- and alkali-treated sewage sludge by the sulfate-reducing bacteria, Desulfovbrio desulfuricans or Desulfotomaculum orientis.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Therefore the officially tabled exposure limits for these chemicals normally correspond to the yield of liberated sulfur dioxide. Dithionites may also produce sulfur dioxide</p> <p>Sulfites have been placed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration generally recognised as safe (GRAS) list. Sulfur dioxide is an irritant gas and occupational exposure may produce irritation under certain circumstances. \u00a0Airborne sodium bisulfite, for example, \u00a0is described by the ACGIH as an irritant to the eyes, skin and mucous membranes of animals; acute exposures by workers produce mild eye and respiratory effects.

The recommended TLV-TWA for sodium bisulfite is thought to be protective against the significant risk of irritant effects associated with higher levels.</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for sulfur dioxide, measuring in excess of 0.1 ppm, are commercially available.</p> <p>Sulfur dioxide is termed a \"mild\" respiratory irritant.</p> <p>Odour threshold (detection) is 0.5 ppm with irritation reported above 2 ppm; at 8-12 ppm eyes and nose are strongly irritated. 150 ppm is only tolerable for about a minute because of extreme irritation. At 500 ppm there is a sense of suffocation. Human bronchoconstriction occurs with inhalation at 5 ppm or more and the recommended TLV-TWA, for sulfur dioxide, is thought to provide a reduction of significant risk of adverse respiratory effects such as coughing, increase in sputum production and bronchoconstriction.</p> <p>The reported effects of SO2 in humans exposed to levels below 2 ppm, together with the potentiation of SO2 toxicity by soot and other particulates, may require a review of exposure standards.</p> <p>A worker inhaling 4 ppm for 8 hours and doing light-work would absorb about 150 mg of SO2.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Potassium poisoning disturbs the rhythm of the heart (a slow, weak pulse, heightened T waves on the ECG, arrhythmias heart block) and eventually produces a fall in blood pressure (due to weakened cardiac contractility). Respiration is initially accelerated but skeletal muscle weakness may bring to the stage of paralysis. Orally poisoned animals die from respiratory failure, sometimes following convulsion and gastroenteritis, dehydration of organs and early kidney damage (renal tubular necrosis).

Spills may produce massive eutrophication in static waters effecting the local aquatic community.</p> <p>Ammonium nitrate penetrates soil at a rate which depends on soil type and water content. It is not expected to accumulate in the food chain.</p> <p>The nitrates are of environmental concern because of their high water solubility and consequent leaching, diffusion, and environmental mobility in soil and water. Nitrate can contaminate groundwater to unacceptable levels. Nitrite is formed from nitrate or ammonium ion by micro-organisms in soil, water, sewage and the alimentary tract. The concern with nitrate in the environment is related to its conversion to nitrite.</p> <p>\u00a0Methaemoglobinaemia is caused following exposure to high levels of nitrite and produces difficulties in oxygen transport in the blood. Thousands of cases involving poisoning of infants, particularly in rural areas, have been reported as a result of drinking nitrate rich well-water.</p> <p>\u00a0Other concerns deriving from exposure to environmental nitrates relate to the production of nitrosamines following the reaction of food nitrites and secondary amines. Other nitroso-compounds may result following reaction with nitrites and amides, ureas, carbamates and other nitrogenous compounds. Nitrosamines produce liver damage, haemorrhagic lung lesions, convulsions and coma in rats, and teratogenic effects in experimental animals.</p> <p>\u00a0The N-nitroso class of compounds include potent carcinogens and mutagens: induction of tumors by single doses of N-nitroso compounds testify to this.</p> <p>In air ammonia is persistent whilst, in water, it biodegrades rapidly to nitrate, producing a high oxygen demand.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>The principal concern with exposure to inorganic nitrate is its biological reduction to reactive and toxic nitrite. Nitrate itself is relatively harmless. Where bacteria are present and the environment is anaerobic, nitrate can be reduced to nitrite. The main site for this reaction is mouth and stomach, but nitrite formation in the lower intestine and in the bladder (urinary infection) may also be of some toxicological importance.</p>\n<p>Adults have tolerated large doses of nitrate as sodium and ammonium salt (&gt; 100 mg NO3-/kg) in some cases repeated for several days for medical or experimental purposes with only minor effects in some subjects (light methaemoglobinaemia, diarrhoea, vomiting). Death and severe effects of nitrate ingestion are generally associated with doses above 10 g NO3-. Doses between 2 and 9 g NO3- have been reported to cause methaemoglobinaemia. These values correspond to 33 to 150 mg NO3-/kg</p>\n<p>The half-life in the body for an oral dose of nitrate to be approximately 5 hours. As blood absorption depends on food matrix and route of exposure, and as larger doses may increase the urinary excretion rate, the biological half-life for both nitrate and nitrite should be expected to be 3 to 8 hours.Nitrate does not accumulate in the body.</p>\n<p>The major acute toxic effect of nitrate and nitrite poisoning is methaemoglobinaemia.</p> <p>The lethal oral dose of nitrite for adults has been variously reported to be between 0.7 and 6 g NO2- (approximately 10 to 100 mg NO2-/kg). Lower doses may apply for children (especially neonates), the elderly and people with certain enzyme deficiencies. The first symptoms of oral nitrite poisoning develop within 15 to 45 minutes</p>\n<p>In humans, inorganic nitrites produce smooth muscle relaxation, methaemoglobinaemia and cyanosis.The primary effect of nitrite intoxication in animals is methaemoglobinaemia whilst secondary effects include vasodilation, relaxation of smooth muscle and lowering of blood pressure. Other nitrite-induced toxic effects include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, atrophied intestinal villi and apoptotic cell death in the intestinal crypts. Nitrite may also cause sudden fall in blood pressure due to its vasodilating properties.Nitrite has vasodilating properties, probably through transformation into nitric oxide (NO) or a NO-containing molecule acting as a signal factor for smooth muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p>Fatal poisonings in infants, resulting from ingestion of nitrates in water or spinach, have been reported.</p>\n<p>When sodium nitrite was administered in drinking water for 6 weeks (0.06-1%), mice showed a slight degeneration and spotty necrosis of hepatocytes and haemosiderin deposition in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, indicating haemolysis. At 2%, mice died within 3 weeks. In rats, subject to the same treatment regime, abnormal blood and spleen colours, due to MHG, were seen in 0.5% and 1.0% treatment groups. Hepatic microsomal lipoperoxidation (as measured by malondialdehyde formation) was increased in male rats given 0.2% sodium nitrite in drinking water. Liver lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase aaand cathepsin) and superoxide dismutase activities were also increased. This data suggests that the nitrite stimulates generation of superoxide radicals in the liver causing damage to cellular and subcellular membranes. Decreased plasma vitamin E and greater reduced glutathione-per erythrocyte were also reported in male rats receiving sodium nitrite in drinking water.</p> <p>The substance and/or its metabolites may bind to haemoglobin inhibiting normal uptake of oxygen. This condition, known as \"methaemoglobinemia\", is a form of oxygen starvation (anoxia).</p> <p>\u00a0Symptoms include cyanosis (a bluish discolouration skin and mucous membranes) and breathing difficulties. Symptoms may not be evident until several hours after exposure.</p> <p>\u00a0At about 15% concentration of blood methaemoglobin there is observable cyanosis of the lips, nose and earlobes. Symptoms may be absent although euphoria, flushed face and headache are commonly experienced. At 25-40%, cyanosis is marked but little disability occurs other than that produced on physical exertion. At 40-60%, symptoms include weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, increasingly severe headache, ataxia, rapid shallow respiration, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy and stupor. Above 60% symptoms include dyspnea, respiratory depression, tachycardia or bradycardia, and convulsions. Levels exceeding 70% may be fatal.\u00a0</p> <p>Swallowing large doses of ammonium nitrate may cause dilation of blood vessels by direct smooth muscle relaxation and methaemoglobinaemia. Symptoms include dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, weakness, convulsions and collapse. Other effects of exposure include headache, warm flushed skin, nausea, vomiting, diuresis and fatigue. Both tachycardia and bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac ischaemia, frequent ventricular premature beats and bigeminy have been reported. Severe poisonings have produced hypotension, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, cardiovascular</p> <p>collapse, convulsions and coma</p> <p>Human metabolism allows detoxification of ammonia, however toxic effects appear if this mechanism is overwhelmed by other than small doses.\u00a0</p> <p>Ingestion of ammonium salts may produce local irritation, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Very large doses of ammonium salts may produce a drop in blood pressure, collapse, central nervous system disorders, spasms, narcosis, respiratory paralysis and haemolysis.</p> <p>Large doses of ammonium salts may be sufficiently absorbed to produce diuresis and systemic ammonia poisoning. Such poisonings have been described after parenteral administration of the salts and produce flaccidity of facial muscles, tremor, generalised discomfort, anxiety and impairment of motor performance, recognition and of critical flicker fusion. Such a clinical picture resembles that found in terminal liver failure - elevated levels of ammonia are found regularly in advanced liver disease.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Chronic exposure to ammonium nitrate may produce hypotension and fatigue. Chronic ingestion of 6-12 grams per day has produced gastritis, acidosis, isosmotic diuresis and nitrite toxicity manifested by \u00a0methaemoglobinaemia or vasodilation</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>The major concern of possible long-term effects of exposure to nitrate and nitrite is associated with formation of nitroso compounds, many of which are carcinogenic. This formation may take place wherever nitrite and nitrosable compounds are present, but it is favoured by acidic conditions or the presence of some bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract and especially the stomach is regarded as the main formation site, but nitrosation reactions can also take place in an infected urinary bladder.</p>\n<p>Nitrite is mutagenic in a number of in vitro assays against microorganisms or cultured mammalian cells. Nitrates show no mutagenic activity in microbial tests under aerobic conditions. Activity has been reported under anaerobic conditions, probably due to reduction of nitrate into nitrite</p>\n<p>The mutagenic effects of nitrites were observed in an in vivo and in vitro experiment using Syrian hamsters. In vivo assays have been equivocal, both positive and negative results having been reported</p>\n<p>Exposure to sodium nitrite in drinking water resulted in an increased incidence of epithelial hyperplasia in the forestomach of male and female rats and in the glandular stomach of male mice.</p>\n<p>There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium nitrite in female B6C3F1 mice based on the positive trend in the incidences of squamous cell papillomas or carcinomas (combined) of the forestomach. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male and female F344/N rats or B6C3F1 male mice exposed to 750, 1500 or 3000 ppm.</p>\n<p>NTP Technical Report Series No. 495, May 2001</p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, nitrites can react with secondary amines, either alone or in biological systems, to form carcinogenic nitrosamines.</p>\n<p>Sodium nitrite (60 mg/kg) administered in drinking water to pregnant guinea pigs produced maternal anaemia and increased the incidences of abortion and foetal mortality. Administration of 2000-3000 mg/l sodium nitrite in drinking water, to pregnant rats, produced 30-53% foetal mortality. In rat dams given 0.025-0.5% in feed, sodium nitrite caused an increase in foetal and pup mortality and decreases in pre-weanling body weights.</p>",

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

The exceptional range of antitumour, antiviral, and\r\nantibiotic activities, as well as their presence in peptides, or ability to\r\nbind to proteins, DNA, and RNA, has directed numerous synthetic studies and new\r\napplications of these azole heterocycles.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While other azole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of\r\nbioactive natural products, the imidazole ring occurs largely in the context of\r\nthe natural amino acid histidine. In addition, the imidazole ring appears as a\r\ncomponent of unnatural cyclic peptides and is used as an ester isostere in\r\npeptidomimetic studies. However, the applications of imidazole are not limited\r\nto the realm of peptides and peptidomimetics. Imidazoles are present in the\r\nlarge family of bromopyrrole-imidazole alkaloids isolated from marine sponges\r\nbased on the common metabolite oroidin that feature significant biological\r\nactivities. The imidazole ring is also present in the pilocarpine alkaloids, as\r\nwell as potential therapeutic agents for thrombosis, cancer, and inflammatory\r\ndiseases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Various compounds that possess an imidazoline or guanidinium\r\nmoiety, along with a number of chemically related compounds, elicit a variety\r\nof pharmacological effects on cardiovascular/cerebrovascular function,\r\nmetabolism, insulin secretion and ion transport. These compounds include the\r\nalpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, mixed alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist/alpha2-adrenoceptor\r\nantagonists and an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist and an ion transport\r\ninhibitor and other structurally related ligands. Although such ligands\r\ninteract with known receptor systems, some of their functional effects, such as\r\ntheir centrally-mediated effects on blood pressure and their ability to augment\r\nglucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, are\r\npharmacologically ill-defined. Indeed, several studies indicate that these\r\nmolecules interact with distinct imidazoline binding sites. These sites share\r\nthe common property of not recognizing endogenous agonists for known monoamine\r\nreceptors and exhibiting high affinity for selected compounds containing an\r\nimidazoline, guanidinium or structurally-related substituent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most bio-active derivatives bear a substituent (aryl or alkyl\r\ngroup) on the carbon between the nitrogen centres.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A number of substituted imidazoles are selective inhibitors of\r\nnitric oxide synthase, which makes them interesting drug targets in\r\ninflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system.\r\nOther biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the\r\ndownregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with\r\ntranslation initiation</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolines are biologically active pharmacophores and synthetic\r\nintermediates in medicinal chemistry.

These salts have been used as ionic liquids and precursors to stable\r\ncarbenes. Salts where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known;\r\nthese salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate,\r\nNaC3H3N2)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Imidazolate (C3H3N-2) is the conjugate base of imidazole. It is a\r\nnucleophile and a strong base. The free anion has C2v symmetry.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

                "Environment": "<p>For imidazole</p> <p>Imidazole is a colourless yellow solid with an amine-like odour. It has a water solubility of 663 g/l at 20.C (pH 10.5 for 68 g/l at 20 C). Imidazole is a heterocyclic compound containing two nitrogens with pKa = 7.0 and pKa =14.9. The melting point ranges from 88.3 to 89.9 .C, the boiling point is at 267.8 .C at 1013.3 hPa and the vapour pressure is 0.00327 hPa at 25.C.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The distribution of the substance between the compartments of air, biota, sediment, soil and water was calculated according to Mackay Level I fugacity model. The non-charged molecule distributes mainly to the water (99.98 %).</p> <p>A soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) of 9.72 was estimated for imidazole. This Koc value suggests that this \u00a0compound would be mobile in soil and adsorption to suspended solids would not be important. From the pKa-value of 14.9 it can be assumed that under environmental conditions the substance is available as a cation. Therefore, binding of the substance to the matrix of soils with high capacities for cation exchange (e.g. clay) cannot be excluded.</p> <p>A calculated Henry's law constant of 0.38 Pa.m3/mol at 25 C and experimental values for water solubility and vapour pressure suggest that volatilization from water would not be an important fate process. Hydrolytic degradation is not to be expected under environmental conditions.</p> <p>The half-life for photodegradation in air was calculated to be 10.7 hours. Half-lives for photolysis in water between 4.4 hours and 307 days have been reported dependant on OH concentrations and light intensity. The substance has no considerable potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow = -0.02, measured).

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>It is the goal of the ACGIH (and other Agencies) to recommend TLVs (or their equivalent) for all substances for which there is evidence of health effects at airborne concentrations encountered in the workplace.</p> <p>At this time no TLV has been established, even though this material may produce adverse health effects (as evidenced in animal experiments or clinical experience). Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p>",

Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p>",

Haematological complications although rare, may include hypoplastic or aplastic anaemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia. Allergic hypersensitivities are characterised by drug fever, eczematous dermatitis and urticaria, morbili-form and scarlatiniform eruptions (both rare), erythema multiforme, photo-sensitivity, peripheral, angioneurotic, and laryngeal oedema, asthma, lupus-like syndrome and anaphylaxis.</p> <p>\u00a0Long-term use of antihistamines may result in extrapyramidal symptoms such as facial dyskinesia (difficulty in movement). Improvements are generally noted upon discontinuance of treatment.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide is oxidised rapidly by both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions and is removed from the atmosphere by precipitation and by dry deposition on surfaces, mainly as sulfuric acid. Because of its high vapor pressure (3,000 mm Hg at 20\u00b0C), sulfur dioxide is typically present in a gaseous phase Some of the sulfur dioxide emitted into the air moves unchanged to various surfaces including soil, water, grass, and vegetation in general.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide can be transformed into sulfuric acid or sulfates by a variety of processes. Sulfur dioxide may be oxidised to sulfur trioxide (SO3) and sulfate in air photochemically or catalytically. The oxidations generally involve homogeneous-phase reactions (oxidation in the gas phase) and heterogeneous gas-solid reactions (oxidation on the surface of particles). Gas-phase reactions include direct photochemical oxidation of sulfur dioxide and oxidation by reacting with other gases and substances, including O, O2, O3 NO, NO2NO3 N2O5 OH, hydrocarbons, or some heavy metal ions. In the direct oxidation pathway, sulfur dioxide gas molecules (at different electronically excited states due to solar irradiation) react with each other, forming SO3, which may be further oxidised by other gases or water drops to form sulfate. Reaction pathways with other gases all result in similar end products: SO3, or sulfate. Rate constants for sulfur dioxide oxidation by these gases vary from 2x 10-24 to 4x10-3 cm3 per molecule per second, with the reaction with N2O5 being the fastest. Heterogeneous gas-solid reactions include oxidation of sulfur dioxide on the surfaces of activated carbons, metal oxides, and other particles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide may be photochemically or catalytically oxidized to SO3 and sulfate in air. The oxidations generally involve homogeneous-phase reactions (oxidation in gas or liquid phase) and heterogeneous gas-solid reactions (oxidation on the surface of particles). The atmospheric residence time of sulfur dioxide is about 10 days. Photochemical oxidation involves the reaction of sulfur dioxide with reactive molecules and free radical species, and with products of O3 and alkene gases. Photochemical oxidation is thought to be initiated by absorption of solar irradiation energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide can be oxidized by OH radicals in the gas phase relatively quickly, making it a major mechanism for sulfur dioxide conversion. The conversion rates have been characterized to be &gt;l% per hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the atmosphere, aqueous-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide can occur in cloud, fog, rain, deliquescent aerosol particles, and in surface liquid films on these particles. Once dissolved in these droplets, sulfur dioxide may be oxidised to sulfate via a variety of mechanisms, thus forming acid rain. Such a removal mechanism is commonly termed wet deposition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide can also be removed from air by uptake of plant leaves. It is reported that direct surface uptake of sulfur dioxide is the most significant dry removal process for atmospheric sulfur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide is very soluble in water, and oceans are generally considered to be a sink for sulfur dioxide. It is also possible that oceans can be a source of sulfur dioxide if the equilibrium pressure of sulfur dioxide in surface water exceeds the partial pressure of sulfur dioxide in the air immediately above it. Any potential releases of sulfur dioxide from water would be expected to partition to the atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Dissolved sulfur dioxide in the surface layer of the ocean may be slowly oxidised to the sulfate anion (SO4 2-) by the combined presence of dissolved O2 and trace amounts of transition metal salts as catalysts. At ocean depths, dispersed sulfate may be reduced to sulfur dioxide, sulfur, and hydrogen sulfide by the action of bacteria. Sulfur dioxide absorbed by freshwater lakes is less rapidly oxidized than seawater because of the much lower salt content of freshwater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Soil can absorb sulfur dioxide, with uptake being dependent on the pH and moisture content of the soil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Acid rain is the leading cause in an increase in heavy metal mobility in soil. When soil is basic pH, heavy metals will form insoluble oxides or hydroxides of sulfate, and when soil is acidic, soluble sulfates will form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Sulfur dioxide can be reduced to H2S in heat- and alkali-treated sewage sludge by the sulfate-reducing bacteria, Desulfovbrio desulfuricans or Desulfotomaculum orientis.</span></p> <p>In air ammonia is persistent whilst, in water, it biodegrades rapidly to nitrate, producing a high oxygen demand. Ammonia is strongly adsorbed to soil. Ammonia is non-persistent in water (half-life 2 days) and is moderately toxic to fish under normal temperature and pH conditions. Ammonia is harmful to aquatic life at low concentrations but does not concentrate in the food chain.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.
