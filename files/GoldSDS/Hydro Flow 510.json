Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Hepatic microsomal lipoperoxidation (as measured by malondialdehyde formation) was increased in male rats given 0.2% sodium nitrite in drinking water. Liver lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase aaand cathepsin) and superoxide dismutase activities were also increased.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Severe acute sodium hydroxide dust inhalation exposure may be fatal due to spasm, inflammation and oedema of the larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and severe pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Symptoms of overexposure include burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea and vomiting.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of sodium hydroxide may result in severe burns to the mouth, throat and stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the larynx and subsequent suffocation, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p> <p>A 1% aqueous solution (pH 13.4)of sodium hydroxide \u00a0failed to cause gastric, oesophageal or other damage in rabbits.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

Trimethylstibine formation by microorganisms is now well established, but this process apparently does not occur in animals. Formation of trimethylbismuth by microorganisms has been reported in a few cases.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">For boron and borates:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Boron is generally found in nature bound to oxygen and is never\r\nfound as the free element. Atmospheric boron may be in the form of particulate\r\nmatter or aerosols as borides, boron oxides, borates, boranes, organoboron\r\ncompounds, trihalide boron compounds, or borazines. Borates are relatively\r\nsoluble in water, and will probably be removed from the atmosphere by\r\nprecipitation and dry deposition. The half-life of airborne particles is\r\nusually on the order of days, depending on the size of the particle and atmospheric\r\nconditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Boron readily hydrolyses in water to form the electrically\r\nneutral, weak monobasic acid boric acid (H3BO3) and the monovalent ion,\r\nB(OH)4-. In concentrated solutions, boron may polymerise, leading to the\r\nformation of complex and diverse molecular arrangements. Because most\r\nenvironmentally relevant boron minerals are highly soluble in water, it is\r\nunlikely that mineral equilibria will control the fate of boron in water. Boron\r\nwas found to not be significantly removed during the conventional treatment of\r\nwaste water. \u00a0Boron may, however, be co-precipitated with aluminum,\r\nsilicon, or iron to form hydroxyborate compounds on the surfaces of minerals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Waterborne boron may be adsorbed by soils and sediments.\r\nAdsorption-desorption reactions are expected to be the only significant\r\nmechanism that will influence the fate of boron in water. The extent of boron\r\nadsorption depends on the pH of the water and the chemical composition of the\r\nsoil. The greatest adsorption is generally observed at pH 7.5-9.0. the single\r\nmost important property of soil that will influence the mobility of boron is\r\nthe abundance of amorphous aluminum oxide. The extent of boron adsorption has\r\nalso been attributed to the levels of iron oxide, and to a lesser extent, the\r\norganic matter present in the soil, although other studies found that the\r\namount of organic matter present was not important. The adsorption of boron may\r\nnot be reversible in some soils. The lack of reversibility may be the result of\r\nsolid-phase formation on mineral surfaces and/or the slow release of boron by\r\ndiffusion from the interior of clay minerals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">It is unlikely that boron is bioconcentrated significantly by\r\norganisms from water. A bioconcentration factor (BCF) relates the concentration\r\nof a chemical in the tissues of aquatic and terrestrial animals or plants to\r\nthe concentration of the chemical in water or soil. The BCFs of boron in marine\r\nand freshwater plants, fish, and invertebrates were estimated to be &lt;100.\r\nExperimentally measured BCFs for fish have ranged from 52 to 198. These BCFs\r\nsuggest that boron is not significantly bioconcentrated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As an element, boron itself cannot be degraded in the environment;\r\nhowever, it may undergo various reactions that change the form of boron (e.g.,\r\nprecipitation, polymerization, and acid-base reactions) depending on conditions\r\nsuch as its concentration in water and pH. In nature, boron in generally found\r\nin its oxygenated form. In aqueous solution, boron is normally present as boric\r\nacid and borate ions, with the dominant form of inorganic boron in natural\r\naqueous systems as undissociated boric acid. Boric acid acts as an electron\r\nacceptor in aqueous solution, accepting an hydroxide ion from water to form\r\n(B(OH)4)-ion. In dilute solution, the favored form of boron is B(OH)4. In more\r\nconcentrated solutions (&gt;0.1 M boric acid) and at neutral to alkaline pH\r\n(6\u201311), polymeric species are formed (e.g., B3O3(OH)4-, B5O6(OH)4-,\r\nB3O3(OH)52-, and B4O5(OH)42-)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most boron compounds are transformed to borates in soil due to the\r\npresence of moisture. Borates themselves are not further degraded in soil.\r\nHowever, borates can exist in a variety of forms in soil. Borates are removed\r\nfrom soils by water leaching and by assimilation by plants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The most appreciable boron exposure to the general population is\r\nlikely to be ingestion of food and to a lesser extent in water. As boron is a\r\nnatural component of the environment, individuals will have some exposure from\r\nfoods and drinking water</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Boron-containing salts (borates) are ubiquitous in the environment.\r\nSurface soil, unpolluted waterways and seawater all typically contain\r\nsignificant amounts of boron as borate. Boron is an essential micronutrient for\r\nhealthy growth of plants, however, it can be harmful to boron sensitive plants\r\nin higher quantities. In some areas such as the American Southwest, boron\r\noccurs naturally in surface waters in concentrations that have been shown to be\r\ntoxic to commercially important plants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on the collected information regarding aquatic toxicity,\r\nboron is not regarded as dangerous to aquatic organisms. The concentration in\r\ntreated municipal waste water is a factor 100 lower than the NOEC-value\r\nfor\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">No quality criteria exist for the concentration of boron in soil\r\nand compost. Boron is added to farmland when sewage sludge is applied as a soil\r\nimproving agent, but there is not sufficient data to evaluate its effect on\r\nsoil organisms. Being an essential micro-nutrient, no adverse effects of boron\r\nare expected at low concentrations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In aquatic environments low concentrations of borates generally\r\npromote the growth of algae, whereas higher concentrations inhibited algal\r\ngrowth. In a growth inhibition test with\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus,</i>\u00a0an\r\nEC50 value of 34 mg B/l was determined. Boric acid toxicity in Daphnia 48\r\nh-LC50 (static test) was found to be 95 mg B/l. \u00a0In a separate study it\r\nwas concluded that chronic effects of boron to Daphnia may occur at a\r\nconcentration of &gt; 10 mg/l.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The toxicity of boron in fish is often higher in soft water than\r\nin hard water. The acute toxicity of boron towards\u00a0<i>Danio rerio</i>\u00a0(96\r\nh-LC50) has been determined to 14.2 mg B/l . In a fish early life stage test\r\nwith rainbow trout NOEC levels of boron have been determined in the range\r\nbetween 0.009 and 0.103 mg B/l, whereas the EC50 ranged from 27 to 100 mg B/l\r\ndependent on the water hardness.</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>For inorganic borates and tetraborates:</p> <p>No data are currently available to establish a causal link between inhalation exposures to sodium tetraborates and chronic respiratory and/or systemic effects.</p> <p>An occupationally important toxic effect of the sodium tetraborates is their acute irritant effect when in contact with skin and the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and other sites of the respiratory tract. The irritant properties increase with decreasing water of hydration due to the exothermic effect of hydration. The TLV-TWA of 1 mg/m3 for the anhydrous and pentahydrate forms and 5 mg/m3 for the decahydrate is thought to be protective against the acute irritant effects.</p> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of dusts, generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Borates, as represented by borax, may act as simple respiratory irritants.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Solution of material in moisture on the skin, or perspiration, may increase irritant effects</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Symptoms of borate poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric pain. These may be accompanied headache, weakness and a distinctive red skin rash. In severe cases there may be shock, increased heart rate and the skin may appear blue. Vomiting (which may be violent) is often persistent and vomitus and faeces may contain blood. Weakness, lethargy, headache, restlessness, tremors and intermittent convulsions may also occur. Poisoning produces central nervous system stimulation followed by depression, gastrointestinal disturbance (haemorrhagic gastro-enteritis), erythematous skin eruptions (giving rise to a boiled lobster appearance) and may also involve kidneys (producing oliguria, albuminuria, anuria) and, rarely, liver (hepatomegaly, jaundice). Toxic symptoms may be delayed for several hours.\u00a0</p> <p>Ingested borates are readily absorbed and do not appear to be metabolised via the liver. Excretion occurs mainly through the kidneys in the urine with about half excreted in the first 12 hours and the remainder over 5-12 days. Borates are excreted primarily in the urine regardless of the route of administration.</p> <p>The borates (tetra-, di-, meta, or ortho- salts, in contrast to perborates) once solubilised in the acid of gastric juices, cannot be distinguished from each other on chemical or toxicological grounds. In humans acute gastroenteric (or percutaneous absorption of as little as 1 gm of sodium borate can result in severe gastrointestinal irritation, kidney damage. In adults the mean lethal dose of sodium borate or boric acid probably exceeds 30 gms (Gosselin) and death occurs due to vascular collapse in the early stages or to central nervous system depression in later stages.</p> <p>Children are thought to be more susceptible to the effects of borate intoxication.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in impaired fertility on the basis of: - clear evidence in animal studies of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occurring at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which is not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p><p>There is sufficient evidence to provide a strong presumption that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity, generally on the basis of:</p> <p>- clear results in appropriate animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Chronic poisoning by borates may be characterised gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash. Chronic absorption of small amounts of borax causes mild gastroenteritis and dermatitis.<br />Chronic feeding studies involving borate administration to rats and dogs leads to accumulation in the testes, germ cell depletion and testicular atrophy. Hair loss in a young woman was traced to chronic ingestion of boric acid-containing mouthwashes whilst hair loss, dermatitis, gastric ulcer and hypoplastic anaemia in an adult male was attributed to the consumption of an uncharacterised \"boric tartrate\" for 20 years (symptoms disappeared following withdrawal). Repeated ingestion or inhalation of sub-acute doses of boric acid produces gastrointestinal irritation and disturbance, loss of appetite, disturbed digestion, nausea and vomiting, erythematous rash which may become hard and purpuric, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, reddening of the tongue, cracking of the lips, conjunctivitis, palpebral oedema and kidney injury. Workers exposed to dust levels containing in excess of 31 mg/m3 boric acid, showed atrophic and subatrophic changes of the respiratory mucous membranes. Prolonged ingestion by animals produces a variety of reproductive effects including changes to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, the testes, epididymis and sperm ducts.<br />Inorganic borates convert to boric acid at physiological pH in the aqueous layer overlying the mucosal surfaces prior to absorption. Boric acid is known to be readily taken up from the gastrointestinal tract in rats and humans, as demonstrated by experimental evidence in both human and animal studies, where more than 90% of the administered dose of borate was excreted as boric acid<br />Boric acid is not metabolized in either animals or humans, owing to the high energy level required (523 kJ/mol) to break the B-O bond. Because of the high pKa, regardless of the form of inorganic borate ingested (e.g., boric acid, disodium tetraborate decahydrate or boron associated with animal or plant tissues), uptake is almost exclusively (&gt;98%) as undissociated boric acid.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>Metal-containing inorganic substances generally have negligible vapour pressure and are not expected to partition to air. Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Soluble silicates are wholly inorganic and once diluted have no significant environmental impact. They are saturated with respect to oxygen and as such do not possess a chemical oxygen demand (COD) or a biological oxygen demand (BOD). Depending on pH values soluble silicates in effluent and surface waters are rapidly dispersed and neutralised, by reaction with naturally occurring dissolved polyvalent metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, Al, Fe) forming insoluble silicates or amorphous silica. These products occur in abundance in natural soils and rocks. Dissolved silica resulting from commercial soluble silicates is also indistinguishable from naturally dissolved silica. The soluble silica input to the natural silica cycle from commercial use is furthermore inconsequential in view of the relative size and flux of the natural system. Concentrations of silica in natural waters commonly range from 1 to around 30 mg/l. Higher concentrations (up to 360 mg/l), however, have been found in some groundwaters where these high levels are related to rock type and water temperatures.</p> <p>\u00a0A study of the fate and possible effects of soluble silicates (waterglass) emissions to surface water has been performed by TNO (Apeldoorn NL, 2002). From the results of this study, no significant adverse effects to aquatic systems are to be assumed.</p> <p>Depending on pH values, reaction with naturally occurring dissolved polyvalent metals (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe, Al) will result in insoluble silicate or amorphous silica being formed. These products occur in abundance in natural soils and rocks. Dissolved silica resulting from commercial soluble silicates is also indistinguishable from naturally dissolved silica.</p> <p>Soluble silicates are totally insoluble in n-octanol (and most other organic solvents). The oil/water partition coefficient of these substances is therefore not applicable. Soluble silicates have no potential for bioaccumulation.</p> <p>Untreated soluble silicate solutions are generally alkaline (pH values &gt; 9) and therefore neutralisation should be carried out before discharging to water/ effluent systems. Once neutralised, no adverse effects on aquatic biosystems are known.</p> <p>Microbial methylation plays important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of the \u00a0metalloids and possibly in their detoxification. Many microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts) and animals are now known to biomethylate arsenic, forming both volatile (e.g., methylarsines) and nonvolatile (e.g., methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid) compounds. \u00a0Antimony and bismuth, also undergo biomethylation to some extent. Trimethylstibine formation by microorganisms is now well established, but this process apparently does not occur in animals. Formation of trimethylbismuth by microorganisms has been reported in a few cases.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Lowest-observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) were typically in the range of 1 to 50 mg/m3. When available, the no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were between 0.5 and 10 mg/m3. Differences in values may be due to particle size, and therefore the number of particles administered per unit dose. Generally, as particle size diminishes so does the NOAEL/ LOAEL. Exposure produced transient increases in lung inflammation, markers of cell injury and lung collagen content. There was no evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.</p>",
