Inhaled cardioselective bronchodilators (e.g. Alupent, Salbutamol) are the preferred agents, with aminophylline a second choice.\u00a0</li> <li>Lavage is indicated in patients who require decontamination; ensure use of cuffed endotracheal tube in adult patients.

Therefore emesis should not be induced mechanically or pharmacologically. Mechanical means should be used if it is considered necessary to evacuate the stomach contents; these include gastric lavage after endotracheal intubation.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Isoparaffins were consistently negative on standard bacterial genotoxicity assays. They were also non-genotoxic in\u00a0<i>in vivo</i>\u00a0mammalian testing for somatic or germ cell mutations (mouse micronucleus test and rat dominant lethal assay, respectively).</p> <p>Mullin et al: Jnl Applied Toxicology 10, pp 136-142, 2006</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression.

This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted.

Once aspirated, the\r\nhydrocarbons can create a severe pneumonitis. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Rats given isoparaffinic\r\nhydrocarbons - isoalkanes- (after 18-24 hours fasting) showed lethargy and/or\r\ngeneral weakness, ataxia and diarrhoea. Symptoms disappeared within 24-28\r\nhours.</span></p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Repeated application of mildly hydrotreated oils (principally paraffinic), to mouse skin, induced skin tumours; no tumours were induced with severely hydrotreated oils.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

                "Use": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petroleum additive alkaryl\r\nsulfonates are used to formulate finished lubricating oils including all types\r\nof automotive and diesel engine crankcase oils, air and water-cooled two-cycle\r\nengine oils, industrial oils, hydraulic fluids, gear oils and metal working\r\nlubricating oils. They are used as high temperature detergents to reduce\r\ndeposits on pistons, engine crankcases, and hydraulic equipment parts and as\r\nrust inhibitors during industrial oil use. Petroleum additive alkaryl\r\nsulfonates are generally sold to finished oil blenders in additive packages,\r\nwhere the concentration ranges from 1 to 50 wt. %. These additive packages are\r\nthen blended into finished oils where the typical concentration of alkaryl\r\nsulfonate ranges from 0.1 to 10 wt. % in the finished oil. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petroleum additive alkaryl\r\nsulfonates are prepared by sulfonation of either synthetic alkylbenzene\r\nsubstrates or naturally occurring alkylaromatic-rich fractions of heavy\r\nlubricating oil base stocks derived from petroleum streams. The alkyl substituent\r\ngroup may vary in number (e.g., mono- or dialkyl), position (e.g.,\r\npredominantly meta or para to the sulfonic acid position), chain length (e.g.,\r\nC14 to C30) or in the degree of branching. Branched and linear alkyl groups of\r\n20 or more carbons are used to enhance oil solubility. Although branched alkyl\r\ngroups are generally presumed to be more water-soluble than straight chains,\r\npetroleum additive alkaryl sulfonates have such low water solubility that the\r\ndegree of branching does not affect their solubility and performance in\r\npetroleum base stocks. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The petroleum additive alkaryl\r\nsulfonates are manufactured in highly refined lubricating base oil, and thus\r\nthe substrates are never isolated. The sulfonic acid substituent group can be\r\nneutralized by alkali metal bases to form the corresponding alkali metal salt.\r\nFor the members of the petroleum additive alkaryl sulfonate category, the\r\nsulfonic acid substituent group may be present as the free acid or as a salt of\r\nsodium, calcium, magnesium or barium. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Hydrophobically stabilized metal\r\nsalt- based nano-particles are added to engine oils to neutralize strong acids\r\nsuch as sulfuric and nitric acid which are produced during fuel combustion.\r\nThese are known as\u201coverbased\u201d (OB) particles because they contain more metal\r\nsalt than is stoichiometrically required to compensate for the charge on the\r\nsurfactant ions in the system. They form classical inverse micelle structures,\r\nwhich enable them to be soluble in hydrophobic oil. The residual surfactant\r\nafter neutralization solubilizes the polar material resulting from the engine\r\noperation and thereby reduces sludge formation. The acid neutralizing\r\ncapability of the particles is measured in terms of the total base number (TBN)\r\nwhich is the equivalent neutralizing ability in units of milligrams of KOH per\r\ngram. Phenate, sulfonate, salicylate, and calixarate surfactants are used,and\r\nthe TBN values of these particles with fatty acid (typically stearate)\r\nco-surfactant in commercial OB products are typically in the range 300-400.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Overbased members of the category\r\nare considered more dilute analogs of the category members that are not\r\noverbased</span><span style=\"color:black\">. </span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">The chemicals in this group are\r\nsalts of structurally related linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LASs) that have\r\nsurfactant properties</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates\r\n(LAS) are, by volume, the most important group of synthetic anionic surfactant\r\ntoday. LAS are mainly used in laundry detergents and cleaning agents. LAS are\r\nfrequently used as the sodium salts as the sole surfactant in a formulation or\r\nin conjunction with other anionic, nonionic or cationic surfactants. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The chemicals in this group can\r\nhave an alkyl chain between 10 and 16 carbon atoms. The main commercial grade\r\nmaterial is typically limited to a range of 10-14 or 10-13 carbons with a\r\ndodecyl-component of 20-35 %. The carbon chain distribution of the chemicals\r\nwill vary depending on the method of production and the source of the precursor\r\nchemicals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">T he chemicals in this group are\r\nexpected to have similar toxicity, which is primarily due to the alkylbenzene\r\nsulfonate anion. They share similar physico-chemical properties, including\r\ndensity and melting points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The solubility of the homologues\r\ndiffers based on the alkyl chain length, usually decreasing with increasing\r\nchain length.However, as the chemicals are also mixtures of positional isomers,\r\nchemicals with the same alkyl chain distribution (same average carbon number)\r\ncan have different properties depending on the 2-phenyl isomer content\r\n(consistent with 4-substitution as the major product with smaller amounts of\r\nthe 2-substitution) </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS consist of an alkyl chain\r\nattached to a benzene ring in the para position to the sulfonate group.\r\nSometimes toluene, xylene and naphthalene are used in place of benzene. The\r\nhomologue distribution in commercial products covers alkyl chain lengths from\r\nC10 to C13 with an average chain length of C11.6. LAS raw materials are derived\r\nfrom linear alkyl benzenes in which the ring is attached to a C-atom which is\r\nitself attached to two other C-atoms. The benzene ring may be attached to any\r\nof the C atoms from C2 to C6 but not to C1. Structures in which the benzene ring\r\nmay be attached to different C atoms are described as isomers. E.g., the\r\nstructure with a C12 alkyl chain and the benzene ring attached at the second\r\nalkyl carbon is designated as the C12-2-isomer and abbreviated C12-2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">LAS can be represented\r\nstructurally as:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">H3C(CH3)xCH(C6H4S)3.Na+)CH2(CH2)yCH3\r\n- x+y=9</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Compared to traditional soaps\r\nbranched alkyl benzenesulfonates (BAS) offer superior tolerance to hard water\r\nand better foaming. However, the highly branched tail made it difficult to\r\nbiodegrade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The term \"linear\"\r\nrefers to the starting alkenes rather than the final product. The alkylation of\r\nlinear alkenes, even 1- alkenes such as 1-dodecene gives several isomers of\r\nphenyldodecane.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Under ideal conditions the\r\ncleaning power of BAS and LAS is very similar, however LAS performs slightly\r\nbetter in normal use conditions, due to it being less affected by hard water.\r\nWithin LAS itself the detergency of the various isomers are fairly similar,\r\nhowever their physical properties (Krafft point, foaming etc.) are noticeably\r\ndifferent\u00a0 In particular the Krafft point of the high 2-phenyl product remains\r\nbelow 0 deg C up to 25% LAS whereas the low 2-phenyl cloud point is 5 deg C.\r\nThis behavior is often exploited by producers to create either clear or cloudy\r\nproducts.</span></p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion.

Two of the  alkaryl sulfonates and one homologue were subjected to biodegradability  testing and found to be poorly biodegradable. Computer modeled data  indicated that the alkaryl sulfonates do not readily photodegrade <br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Existing  data on acute fish toxicity, acute invertebrate toxicity, and alga  toxicity indicates a low order of toxicity to fish, aquatic  invertebrates and alga when the appropriate test methods were used.<br />Fish  toxicity: Overall, the LC50 for these substances was greater than 100  mg/L indicating a relatively low order of acute toxicity to fish. <br />Invertebrate  toxicity (daphnid): Overall, the EC50 for these substances was greater  than 100 mg/L indicating a relatively low order of acute toxicity to  daphnids. <br />Alage toxicity: Overall, the EC50 for these substances was  greater than 100 mg/L indicating a relatively low order of toxicity to  algae.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>For linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acids (LABS) (and their salts):<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />LABS  are generally highly water soluble (miscible) and have a relatively low  Kow. The environmental fate data indicate that these chemicals are  highly susceptible to photo-and biodegradation.<br />LABS are strong acids  (pKa &lt;1) that are completely ionised in aqueous solutions. The  chemical species present in aqueous solutions at neutral (physiological)  pH is the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (the LAS ion) (C10-14 linear  alkyl benzene-SO3-), the identical species present in solutions of LAS,  where the counter ion (typically sodium, calcium or ammonium) will  disassociate to form the LAS anion. Thus, the physical-chemical,  environmental fate, ecotoxicity and toxicity properties of the LABS and  LAS would be expected to be similar. It should be noted that the LABS  are liquids and LAS is a solid at room temperature. However, in water  the difference between the LAB sulfonic acids and LAS disappears as  dissociation results in the same ion in solution. Therefore, parameters  such as Kow, water solubility and pH/pKa are appropriate to compare. The  octanol-water partition coefficients are around 2 (log Kow) for all of  the chemicals in this category <br />LABS are not expected to volatilise  significantly. Fugacity modeling predicts that most of these chemicals  will partition to the soil and water. Very little partitions to the air  or sediment. <br />Photodegradation is estimated (using EPI Suite  software) to be a significant mechanism for breakdown. Based on the  model estimates, the hydroxyl radical reaction half-lives ranged from  about 7 to 8.6 hours. Estimated data for LAS were similar. Furthermore,  measured data for LAS suggest even more rapid photodegradation, with 95%  of the material degraded within 20 minutes at 20 C in a laboratory  study. <br />Experimental data data indicates that LAS is stable in water. <br />LABS  are generally biodegradable. Measured biodegradation data indicate  substantial microbial degradation under aerobic conditions. For  dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid 69% of the material mineralised after 28  days. Biodegradation of the C10-16 derivatives and the LAS are also  rapid, with 93% or greater of the material degrading within 28 or 37  days. In addition, studies show that straight chain alkylbenzene  sulfonate materials readily degrade, with the shorter chain length  compounds degrading more rapidly\u00a0 Thus, the data indicate that these  chemicals are highly susceptible to degradation, both by photolytic and  microbial mechanisms <br />The initial step in the biodegradation of LABS  under aerobic conditions is an omega -oxidation of the terminal methyl  group of the alkyl chain to form a carboxylic acid. Further degradation  proceeds by a stepwise shortening of the alkyl chain by beta -oxidation  leaving a short-chain sulfophenyl carboxylic acid. In the presence of  molecular oxygen the aromatic ring structure hydrolyses to form a  dihydroxy-benzene structure which is opened before desulfonation of the  formed sulfonated dicarboxylic acid. The final degradation steps have  not been investigated in details but are likely to occur by general  bacterial metabolic routes involving a total mineralisation and  assimilation into biomass . Both the initial omega -oxidation and the  hydroxylation of the ring structure of LAS require molecular oxygen, and  they are not expected to take place under anoxic conditions.<br />The  BioConcentration Factor (BCF) tends to increase with increasing alkyl  chain length but also the position of the aryl sulfonate moiety was  important. A higher BCF was seen for linear alkyl benzenesulfonate  isomers with the aryl sulfonate attached. Available data indicate that  LABS have low to moderate bioaccumulation potential, with a  bioconcentration factor for dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid of 130. LAS  has bioconcentration factors that range from 22 to 87. <br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Numerous  studies have been performed to determine the effects of LABS towards  aquatic organisms. The aquatic effect concentrations that were observed  in these studies are highly variable. This variation is partly related  to the testing of different isomers and homologues, but it may also be  due to the specific test conditions and species. The length of the alkyl  chain is an important factor determining the aquatic toxicity. In  general, the homologues with the highest number of carbons in the alkyl  chain are more toxic than are those with shorter alkyl chains. Today,  commercial LABS have a homologue distribution between C10 and C13 with a  typical average alkyl chain length of C11.6. <br />The widest range in  the toxicity of LABS towards species belonging to the same group is  found for algae\u00a0 Approximately 90% of the data found in the literature  fall between 0.1 and 100 mg/l. Typical ranges of EC50 values are 1 to  100 mg/l for fresh water species and &lt; 1 to 10 mg/l for marine  species. Typical values lie between 29 and 170 mg/l <br />A very low EC100  value of 0.025 mg/l was determined for Gymnodium breve. Previous  studies in which Gymnodium breve was exposed with AES confirm that this  species is highly sensitive to surfactants, and occasionally available  data for Gymnodium breve should therefore not be used for comparison of  the aquatic toxicity between various surfactants.<br />LC50 values have  been found in the range of 1 to 10 mg/l when Daphnia magna were exposed  with LABS homologues between C10 and C13. The acute toxicity of LABS to  Daphnia magna generally increases with increasing alkyl chain length.\u00a0  Typical values lie between 3 and 12 mg/l. <br />A study with the marine  crustacean Acartia tonsa indicated that a C10-13 LAS affected the  survival at 0.54 mg/l (LC50) and the development rate at 0.51 mg/l  (EC50) after 8 days of exposure. The 48 h-LC50 that was obtained in the  same study with Acartia tonsa was 2.1 mg/l. <br />Metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS are reported to have a much lower toxicity to  invertebrates compared to the toxicity of the intact surfactant.<br />The  toxicity of LABS to fish generally increases with increasing alkyl chain  length, and approximately a 10-fold difference in toxicity between  homologues separated by two carbon atoms has been observed. As also  noted for invertebrates, fish are less susceptible to metabolites from  biotransformation of LABS . LC50 values below 1 mg/l were found for  C11.9 (0.71 mg/l), C13 and C14 (both 0.4 mg/l) in studies with fathead  minnow.<br />LABS sorb to sediment with partition coefficients of 50 to  1,000. The toxicity of LABS bound to sediment is relatively low compared  to LABS in solution. NOEC and LOEC values were as high as 319 and 993  mg LABS/kg, respectively, for the sediment-living Chironomus riparius.  The corresponding NOEC for LABS in solution was as low as 2.4 mg/l  indicating that only a small fraction of the sorbed LABS was  bioavailable. LABS dissolved in water may also cause chronic effects  like reduction of the growth rate of the marine mussel Mytilus  galloprovincialis. LABS sorbed to sediments did not have similar  effects.<br />Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in  Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment  Project, 615, 2001.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
