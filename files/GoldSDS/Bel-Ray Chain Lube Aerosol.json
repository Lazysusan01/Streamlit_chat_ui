As with many alkanes, experimental methods for the estimation\r\nof the Koc parameter are lacking, so that estimates must be made based on\r\ntheoretical considerations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The dominant transport process from water is volatilization. Based\r\non mathematical models the half-life for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane in bodies of\r\nwater with any degree of turbulent mixing (e.g., rivers) would be less than 3\r\nhours. For standing bodies of water (e.g. small ponds), a half-life no longer\r\nthan one week (6.8 days) is estimated Based on the log octanol/water partition\r\ncoefficient (i.e. log[Koc]) and the estimated log sorption coefficient (i.e.\r\nlog[Koc])\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is not expected to become concentrated in biota.\r\nA calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 453 for a fathead minnow further\r\nsuggests a low potential for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane to bioconcentrate or\r\nbioaccumulate in trophic food chains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In soil, the dominant transport mechanism for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\npresent near the surface probably is volatilisation (based on its Henry\u2019s law\r\nconstant, water solubility, vapor pressure, and Koc). While its estimated Koc\r\nvalues suggest a moderate ability to sorb to soil particles,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nhas a density (0.6603 g/mL at 20 C) well below that of water and a very low\r\nwater solubility of 9.5 mg/L.\u00a0<i>n-</i>Hexane would, therefore, be viewed\r\nas a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), which would suggest a low potential\r\nfor leaching into the lower soil depths since the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane would\r\ntend to float on the top of the saturated zone of the water table.\u00a0<i>n-</i>Hexane\r\nwould generally stay near the soil surface and, if not appreciably sorbed into\r\nthe soil matrix, would be expected eventually to volatilise to the atmosphere.\r\nExceptions would involve locations with shallow groundwater tables where there\r\nwere large spills of hexane products. In such cases, the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\ncould spread out to contaminant a large volume of soil materials.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><i><span style=\"color:black\">n-</span></i><span style=\"color:black\">Hexane\r\ndoes not absorb ultraviolet (UV) light at 290 nm and is thus not expected to\r\nundergo direct photolysis reactions. The dominant tropospheric removal\r\nmechanism for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is generally regarded to be decomposition by\r\nhydroxyl radicals. Calculations assuming typical hydroxyl radical\r\nconcentrations suggest a half-life of approximately 2.9 days. While\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\ncan react with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone precursors under controlled\r\nlaboratory conditions, the smog-producing potential of\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is\r\nvery low compared to that of other alkanes or chlorinated VOCs. Hydroxyl ion\r\nreactions in the upper troposphere, therefore, are probably the primary\r\nmechanisms for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane degradation in the atmosphere. As with most\r\nalkanes,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is resistant to hydrolysis</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Although few data are available\r\ndealing explicitly with the biodegradation of\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane in water,\r\nneither hydrolysis nor biodegradation in surface waters appears to be rapid\r\ncompared with volatilization. In surface waters, as in the atmosphere, alkanes\r\nsuch as\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane would be resistant to hydrolysis. Biodegradation\r\nis probably the most significant degradation mechanism in groundwater. The\r\nability of\u00a0<i>Pseudomonas mendocina\u00a0</i>bacteria to metabolise\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nin laboratory microcosms simulating groundwater conditions has been documented.\r\nMixed bacterial cultures as well as pure cultures are documented as capable of\r\nmetabolizing\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane under aerobic conditions. In general, linear\r\nalkanes (such as\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane) are viewed as the most readily biodegradable\r\nfractions in petroleum , particularly when oxygen is present in solution. Once\r\nintroduced into groundwater,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane may be fairly persistent\r\nsince its degradation by chemical hydrolysis is slow and opportunities for\r\nbiodegradation may be limited under anoxic conditions or where nutrients such\r\nas nitrogen or phosphorus are in limited supply</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Sediment and Soil:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The most\r\nimportant biodegradation processes involve the conversion of the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nto primary alcohols, aldehydes and, ultimately, into fatty acids. Similar\r\nprocesses are encountered with other light hydrocarbons such as heptane. In\r\ngeneral, unless the\u00a0<i>n</i>-hexane is buried at some depth within a soil\r\nor sediment, volatilisation is generally assumed to occur at a much more rapid\r\nrate than chemical or biochemical degradation processes. Once introduced into\r\ndeeper sediments,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane may be fairly persistent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): Oncorhyncus mykiss 4.14 mg/l; Pimephales\r\npromelus 2.5 mg/l (flow through); Lepomis macrochirus 4.12 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia EC50 (48 h): 3.87 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

It is considered unlikely that other hexanes follow the same metabolic route. It should be noted however that the n-hexane TLV-TWA also applies to commercial hexane having a concentration of greater than 5% n-hexane.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For n-hexane:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 65 ppm</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for n-hexane, measuring in excess of 100 ppm, are available commercially.</p> <p>Occupational polyneuropathy may result from exposures as low as 500 ppm (as hexane), whilst nearly continuous exposures of 250 ppm have caused neurotoxic effects in animals. Many literature reports have failed to distinguish hexane from n-hexane and on the assumption that the commercial hexane contains 30% n-hexane, a worst case recommendation for TLV is assumed to reduce the risk of peripheral neuropathies (due to the metabolites 2,5-heptanedione and 3,6-octanedione) and other adverse neuropathic effects.</p> <p>Concurrent exposure to chemicals (including MEK) and drugs which induce hepatic liver oxidative metabolism can reduce the time for neuropathy to appear.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor(OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.15 (n-HEXANE)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin.

Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL). In addition the US EPA's procedures for risk assessment for hazard identification and dose-response assessment as applied by NIOSH were used in the creation of such limits.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

They occur either as products of commerce (e.g. 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-heptanedione, 3,6-octanedione) or as metabolites (of, for example, n-hexane and 2-hexanone). The neurotoxic syndrome is best described as a sensorimotor or motor polyneuropathy. The initial symptoms are symmetrical sensory numbness and paraesthesias of the distal portions of the extremities. Sensory loss usually involves all modalities of the feet or hands. Motor weakness is typically observed in the muscles of the toes and fingers but may also involve the muscles of arms, thighs and forearms. Onset of symptoms may be delayed for several months to a year after the initial exposure. Pathologically the syndrome is characterised by a swelling of the axon, demyelination and nerve fibre degradation resembling a dying-back neuropathy.</p> <p>Central and autonomic nervous systems are unaffected.</p> <p>The clinical course of the disease following removal from exposure is complete recovery, but severe cases may retain sensorimotor deficits.</p>",

                "HandlingProcedure": "<p><br /></p> <p>Natural gases contain a contaminant, radon-222, a naturally occurring radioactive gas. During subsequent processing, radon tends to concentrate in liquefied petroleum streams and in product streams having similar boiling points. Industry experience indicates that the commercial product may contain small amounts of radon-222 and its radioactive decay products (radon daughters). The actual concentration of radon-222 and radioactive daughters in process equipment (IE lines, filters, pumps and reactor units) may reach significant levels and produce potentially damaging levels of gamma radiation. A potential external radiation hazard exists at or near any pipe, valve or vessel containing a radon enriched stream or containing internal deposits of radioactive material. Field studies, however, have not shown that conditions exist that expose the worker to cumulative exposures in excess of general population limits. Equipment containing gamma-emitting decay products should be presumed to be internally contaminated with alpha-emitting decay products which may be hazardous if inhaled or ingested. During maintenance operations that require the opening of contaminated process equipment, the flow of gas should be stopped and a four hour delay enforced to allow gamma-radiation to drop to background levels. Protective equipment (including high efficiency particulate respirators (P3) suitable for radionucleotides or supplied air) should be worn by personnel entering a vessel or working on contaminated process equipment to prevent skin contamination or inhalation of any residue containing alpha-radiation.

                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>For petroleum distillates:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental fate:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>When petroleum substances are\nreleased into the environment, four major fate processes will take place:\ndissolution in water, volatilization, biodegradation and adsorption.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Hydrocarbons may sensitise the heart to adrenalin and other circulatory catecholamines; as a result cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation may occur. Abrupt collapse may produce traumatic injury. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may be evident early. Symptoms of moderate poisoning may include giddiness, headache, dizziness and nausea. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation. Symptoms include rapid respiration, mental dullness, lack of coordination, poor judgement, nausea and vomiting.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
