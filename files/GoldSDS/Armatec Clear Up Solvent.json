                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

A substantial amount of acetone can also be found in water, which is consistent with the high water to air partition coefficient and its small, but detectable, presence in rain water, sea water, and lake water samples. Very little acetone is expected to reside in soil, biota, or suspended solids. This is entirely consistent with the physical and chemical properties of acetone and with measurements showing a low propensity for soil absorption and a high preference for moving through the soil and into the ground water</p> <p>In air, acetone is lost by photolysis and reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; the estimated half-life of these combined processes is about 22 days. The relatively long half-life allows acetone to be transported long distances from its emission source.</p> <p>Acetone is highly soluble and slightly persistent in water, with a half-life of about 20 hours; it is minimally toxic to aquatic life.</p> <p>Acetone released to soil volatilises although some may leach into the ground where it rapidly biodegrades.</p> <p>Acetone does not concentrate in the food chain.</p> <p>Acetone meets the OECD definition of readily biodegradable which requires that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) is at least 70% of the theoretical oxygen demand (THOD) within the 28-day test period</p> <p>Drinking Water Standard: none available.</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: none available.</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: none available.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Testing shows that acetone exhibits a low order of toxicity</p> <p>Fish LC50: brook trout 6070 mg/l; fathead minnow 15000 mg/l</p> <p>Bird LC0 (5 day): Japanese quail, ring-neck pheasant 40,000 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): 15800 mg/l; NOEC 8500 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate 2100 - 16700 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic plant NOEC: 5400-7500 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna chronic NOEC 1660 mg/l</p> <p>Acetone vapors were shown to be relatively toxic to two types insects and their eggs. The time to 50% lethality (LT50) was found to be 51.2 hr and 67.9 hr when the flour beetle (<i>Tribolium confusum</i>) and the flour moth (<i>Ephestia kuehniella</i>) were exposed to an airborne acetone concentration of 61.5 mg/m3. The LT50 values for the eggs were 30-50% lower than for the adult. The direct application of acetone liquid to the body of the insects or surface of the eggs did not, however, cause any mortality.</p> <p>The ability of acetone to inhibit cell multiplication has been examined in a wide variety of microorganisms. The results have generally indicated mild to minimal toxicity with NOECs greater than 1700 mg/L for exposures lasting from 6 hr to 4 days. Longer exposure periods of 7 to 8 days with bacteria produced mixed results; but overall the data indicate a low degree of toxicity for acetone. The only exception to these findings were the results obtained with the flagellated protozoa (<i>Entosiphon sulcatum</i>) which yielded a 3-day NOEC of 28 mg/L.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Rarely, convulsions and tubular necrosis may be evident. Other symptoms of exposure may include restlessness, headache, vomiting, low blood-pressure and rapid and irregular pulse, eye and throat irritation, weakness of the legs and dizziness. Inhalation of high concentrations may produce dryness of the mouth and throat, nausea, uncoordinated movement, loss of coordinated speech, drowsiness and, in severe cases, coma.

In unsaturated topsoil containing organic material, it has been estimated that 97% of the toluene is adsorbed to the soil and only about 2% is in the soil-water phase and transported with flowing groundwater. There is little retardation in sandy soils and 2-13% of the toluene was estimated to migrate with flowing water; the remainder was volatilised, biodegraded, or unaccounted for. In saturated deep soils with no soil-air phase, about 48% may be transported with flowing groundwater.</p> <p><b>Transformation/Persistence:</b></p> <p><b>Air\u00a0</b>- The main degradation pathway for toluene in the atmosphere is reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The estimated atmospheric half life for toluene is about 13 hours. Toluene is also oxidised by reactions with atmospheric nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and ozone, but these are minor degradation pathways. Photolysis is not considered a significant degradative pathway for toluene\u00a0</p> <p><b>Soil\u00a0</b>- In surface soil, volatilisation to air is an important fate process for toluene. Biodegradation of toluene has been demonstrated in the laboratory to occur with a half life of about 1 hour. In the environment, biodegradation of toluene to carbon dioxide occurs with a typical half life of 1-7 days.</p> <p><b>Water\u00a0</b>- An important fate process for toluene is volatilization, the rate of which depends on the amount of turbulence in the surface water .The volatilisation of toluene from static water has a half life of 1-16 days, whereas from turbulent water the half life is 5-6 hours. Degradation of toluene in surface water occurs primarily by biodegradation with a half life of less than one day under favorable conditions (presence of microorganisms, microbial adaptation, and optimum temperature). Biodegradation also occurs in shallow groundwater and in salt water at a reduced rate). No data are available on anaerobic degradation of toluene in deep ground water conditions where aerobic degradation would be minimal .</p> <p><b>Biota\u00a0</b>- Bioaccumulation in most organisms is limited by the metabolism of toluene into more polar compounds that have greater water solubility and a lower affinity for lipids.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause severe eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid produces a high level of eye discomfort and is capable of causing pain and severe conjunctivitis. Corneal injury may develop, with possible permanent impairment of vision, if not promptly and adequately treated.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material produces moderate skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces moderate inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but moderate, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may cause potentially lethal chemical pneumonitis</p> <p>At sufficiently high doses the material may be hepatotoxic (i.e. poisonous to the liver). Signs may include nausea, stomach pains, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-coloured stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)</p>",

As a rule the material produces, or contains a substance which produces severe lesions. Such damage may become apparent following direct application in subchronic (90 day) toxicity studies or following sub-acute (28 day) or chronic (two-year) toxicity tests.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure to the material may cause concerns for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects, generally on the basis that results in appropriate animal studies provide strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Chronic toluene habituation occurs following intentional abuse (glue sniffing) or from occupational exposure. Ataxia, incoordination and tremors of the hands and feet (as a consequence of diffuse cerebral atrophy), headache, abnormal speech, transient memory loss, convulsions, coma, drowsiness, reduced colour perception, frank blindness, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye-movements), hearing loss leading to deafness and mild dementia have all been associated with chronic abuse. Peripheral nerve damage, encephalopathy, giant axonopathy electrolyte disturbances in the cerebrospinal fluid and abnormal computer tomographic (CT scans) are common amongst toluene addicts. Although toluene abuse has been linked with kidney disease, this does not commonly appear in cases of occupational toluene exposures. Cardiac and haematological toxicity are however associated with chronic toluene exposures. Cardiac arrhythmia, multifocal and premature ventricular contractions and supraventricular tachycardia are present in 20% of patients who abused toluene-containing paints. Previous suggestions that chronic toluene inhalation produced human peripheral neuropathy have been discounted. However central nervous system (CNS) depression is well documented where blood toluene exceeds 2.2 mg%. Toluene abusers can achieve transient circulating concentrations of 6.5 %. Amongst workers exposed for a median time of 29 years, to toluene, no subacute effects on neurasthenic complaints and psychometric test results could be established.\u00a0</p> <p>The prenatal toxicity of very high toluene concentrations has been documented for several animal species and man. Malformations indicative of specific teratogenicity have not generally been found. Neonatal toxicity, described in the literature, takes the form of embryo death or delayed foetal growth and delayed skeletal system development. Permanent damage of children has been seen only when mothers have suffered from chronic intoxication as a result of \"sniffing\".</p>",
