                "Environment": "<p>For ketones:</p> <p>Ketones, unless they are alpha, beta--unsaturated ketones, can be considered as narcosis or baseline toxicity compounds</p> <p>Hydrolysis may also involve the addition of water to ketones to yield ketals under mild acid conditions. However, this addition of water is thermodynamically favorable only for low molecular weight ketones. This addition is an equilibrium reaction that is reversible upon a change of water concentration and the reaction ultimately leads to no permanent change in the structure of the ketone substrateThe higher molecular weight ketones do no form stable ketals. Therefore, the ketones are stable to water under ambient environmental conditions\u00a0</p> <p>Another possible reaction of ketones in water involves the enolic hydrogen on the carbons bonded to the carbonyl function. Under conditions of high pH (pH greater than 10), the enolic proton is abstracted by base (OH-) forming a carbanion intermediate that may react with other organic substrates (<i>e.g.,\u00a0</i>ketones, esters, aldehydes) containing a center for nucleophilic attack. The reactions, commonly recognized as condensation reactions, produce higher molecular weight products. Under ambient conditions of temperature, pH, and low concentration, these condensation reactions are unfavorable.\u00a0</p> <p>Based on its reactions in air, it seems likely that ketones undergo photolysis in water. It is probable that ketones will be biodegraded to an appreciable degree by micro-organisms in soil and water.

A substantial amount of acetone can also be found in water, which is consistent with the high water to air partition coefficient and its small, but detectable, presence in rain water, sea water, and lake water samples. Very little acetone is expected to reside in soil, biota, or suspended solids. This is entirely consistent with the physical and chemical properties of acetone and with measurements showing a low propensity for soil absorption and a high preference for moving through the soil and into the ground water</p> <p>In air, acetone is lost by photolysis and reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; the estimated half-life of these combined processes is about 22 days. The relatively long half-life allows acetone to be transported long distances from its emission source.</p> <p>Acetone is highly soluble and slightly persistent in water, with a half-life of about 20 hours; it is minimally toxic to aquatic life.</p> <p>Acetone released to soil volatilises although some may leach into the ground where it rapidly biodegrades.</p> <p>Acetone does not concentrate in the food chain.</p> <p>Acetone meets the OECD definition of readily biodegradable which requires that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) is at least 70% of the theoretical oxygen demand (THOD) within the 28-day test period</p> <p>Drinking Water Standard: none available.</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: none available.</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: none available.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Testing shows that acetone exhibits a low order of toxicity</p> <p>Fish LC50: brook trout 6070 mg/l; fathead minnow 15000 mg/l</p> <p>Bird LC0 (5 day): Japanese quail, ring-neck pheasant 40,000 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48 h): 15800 mg/l; NOEC 8500 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic invertebrate 2100 - 16700 mg/l</p> <p>Aquatic plant NOEC: 5400-7500 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia magna chronic NOEC 1660 mg/l</p> <p>Acetone vapors were shown to be relatively toxic to two types insects and their eggs. The time to 50% lethality (LT50) was found to be 51.2 hr and 67.9 hr when the flour beetle (<i>Tribolium confusum</i>) and the flour moth (<i>Ephestia kuehniella</i>) were exposed to an airborne acetone concentration of 61.5 mg/m3. The LT50 values for the eggs were 30-50% lower than for the adult. The direct application of acetone liquid to the body of the insects or surface of the eggs did not, however, cause any mortality.</p> <p>The ability of acetone to inhibit cell multiplication has been examined in a wide variety of microorganisms. The results have generally indicated mild to minimal toxicity with NOECs greater than 1700 mg/L for exposures lasting from 6 hr to 4 days. Longer exposure periods of 7 to 8 days with bacteria produced mixed results; but overall the data indicate a low degree of toxicity for acetone. The only exception to these findings were the results obtained with the flagellated protozoa (<i>Entosiphon sulcatum</i>) which yielded a 3-day NOEC of 28 mg/L.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Systemic effects of acetone inhalation exposure include central nervous system depression, light-headedness, incoherent speech, ataxia, stupor, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycaemia and ketosis. Rarely, convulsions and tubular necrosis may be evident. Other symptoms of exposure may include restlessness, headache, vomiting, low blood-pressure and rapid and irregular pulse, eye and throat irritation, weakness of the legs and dizziness. Inhalation of high concentrations may produce dryness of the mouth and throat, nausea, uncoordinated movement, loss of coordinated speech, drowsiness and, in severe cases, coma.

Their unhindered oxygen atom carries two unshared pairs of\r\nelectrons - a structure which favours the formation of coordination complexes\r\nand the solvation of cations.

Depending on the structure of the lactone monomer, catalyst/initiator\r\nsystems are known which allow preparation of extremely high molecular weight\r\npolyesters of low polydispersity. In addition to obtaining high molecular\r\nweight polyesters in relatively short reaction cycles and at moderate\r\ntemperature, lactone polymerization allows careful control of polymer end\r\ngroups through proper selection of the initiating species. The type of end\r\ngroup plays an important role in both the thermal stability and hydrolytic\r\nstability of the resulting polyester.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Polylactone-family polymers such as polylactide, polyglycolide and\r\npolycaprolactone are types of\u00a0 aliphatic polyester..

They are used in many\r\nmedical applications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The polymerization of lactone monomers and the copolymerization of\r\nlactone monomers and epoxide monomers yield polymeric products useful in a wide\r\nvariety of applications. For example, caprolactone polyols find utility in\r\npolyurethane coatings, adhesives, and thermoplastic urethane and castable\r\npolymers. Higher molecular weight lactone polymers serve as processing aids and\r\nmodifiers for resins such as ABS and polycarbonate and as hot melt adhesives.\r\nAliphatic polyesters such as polycaprolactone exhibit exceptionally high\r\ncompatibility or miscibility with a variety of common polymeric resins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Lactones have been successfully polymerized using several\r\ndifferent types of catalysts including, for example, metalloporphyrin\r\ncatalysts, bimetallic oxoalkoxides, mixed alkoxyalkyl compounds of zinc and\r\ntin, alkyllithium compounds, basic catalysts such as alkali metal hydroxides\r\nand Lewis acid catalysts such as boron trifluoride. </span></p> <p>Solvent.</p> <p>Intermediate.\u00a0</p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Severe over-exposure to gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) may lead to coma and possible death due to respiratory failure. Ingestion may also cause kidney damage and peripheral neuropathy, a progressive disorder of the nervous system, characterised by sensory and motor abnormalities, muscle spasms, weakness and pain in the arms and legs, numbness and tingling of the fingers and toes and paralysis.</p> <p>In Scandanavia, some cases of poisoning in children have been reported after ingestion of small amounts (less than 8ml) of gamma-butyrolactone</p> <p>Butyrolactone is rapidly metabolised to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and the toxicological profile of the lactone substantially resembles that of the acid (which occurs naturally in animals and humans). Although the function of the acid is unknown in peripheral tissues, in the brain and neuronal tissues it is thought to act as a neuromodulator. gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, the oral, intraperitoneal, or intravenous administration elicits characteristic neuropharmacological responses. The acid is synthesised and released in specific neuronal pathways and its actions are mediated by a set of specific, high affinity receptors which are heterogeneously distributed within the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The acid and its salts have been described as \"date-rape drugs\" because of hypnotic effects produced, in a social context, when these substances have been surreptitiously introduced to unsuspecting individuals.</p> <p>Administration of exogenous gamma-hydroxybutyrolactone induces a state described as behavioural arrest characterised by specific dose-dependent changes in the encephalogram. Administration of low doses to rats produces no changes in the encephalogram. Higher doses induce behavioural arrest, facial myoclonus, vibrissal twitching and loss of righting reflex. Behavioural changes are accompanied by encephalogram patterns resembling those produced during seizures in humans with non-convulsive or absent (petitmal) epilepsy.</p> <p>For \u00a0exposure to the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate:</p> <p>Swallowing may result in intoxication and drowsiness with lowering of inhibitions and increased libido.</p> <p>Side effects of exposure include abnormal muscular activity during the induction phase and nausea and vomiting. Bradycardia frequently occurs. Emergence delirium has been reported. Respiration may be slowed and hypokalaemia has also been recorded</p> <p>Consumption of less than 1 gram of the material acts as a relaxant, causing a loss of muscle tone and reduced inhibitions. Consumption of 1 to 2 grams causes a strong feeling of relaxation and slows the heart rate and respiration. At this dosage level, the material also interferes with blood circulation, motor coordination, and balance. In stronger doses, 2 to 4 grams, pronounced interference with motor and speech control occurs. A coma-like sleep may be induced, requiring intubation to wake the user. When mixed with alcohol, the depressant effects of the material are enhanced. This can lead to respiratory depression, unconsciousness, coma, and overdose.</p> <p>Side effects associated with the sodium salt of GBL may include nausea, vomiting, delusions, depression, vertigo, hallucinations, seizures, respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, slowed heart rate, lowered blood pressure, amnesia, and coma. It can become addictive with sustained use.</p> <p>Patients with a history of around-the-clock use of this material (every 2 to 4 hours) exhibit withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, insomnia, tremors, and episodes of tachycardia (abnormally fast heart rates), and may progress to delirium and agitation. Because it has a short duration of action and quickly leaves the user's system, withdrawal symptoms may occur within 1 to 6 hours of the last dose. These symptoms may last for many months.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Strong evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>gamma-Butyrolactone is rapidly converted to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid by enzymes in the blood and liver of animals and humans. An equivocal response produced by the lactone, in carcinogenicity studies in rats, has been reported in terms of its ability to increase the incidence of pheochromocytomas in the renal medulla. Because of the rapid and extensive conversion of gamma-butyrolactone to the acid, the evaluation of the lactone was in fact an evaluation of gamma-hydroxybutric acid.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Cyclic ethers, including tetrahydrofuran, furan and 1,4-dioxane, produce neoplasms and carcinomas in experimental animals, typically of the liver; other target organs include the adrenal gland, nasal cavity and gall-bladder. 1,4-Dioxane was a promoter in a two-stage skin carcinogenic study in mice. Results of studies with cyclic ethers indicate that carcinogenicity is often species and sex dependent. Furan has been used to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). \u00a0Oxetanes are under investigation.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.
