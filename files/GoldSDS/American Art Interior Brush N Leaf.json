Patients with inadequate tidal volumes or poor arterial blood gases (pO2 50 mm Hg) should be intubated.\u00a0</li> <li>Arrhythmias complicate some hydrocarbon ingestion and/or inhalation and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial injury has been reported; intravenous lines and cardiac monitors should be established in obviously symptomatic patients. The lungs excrete inhaled solvents, so that hyperventilation improves clearance.\u00a0</li> <li>A chest x-ray should be taken immediately after stabilisation of breathing and circulation to document aspiration and detect the presence of pneumothorax.\u00a0</li> <li>Epinephrine (adrenalin) is not recommended for treatment of bronchospasm because of potential myocardial sensitisation to catecholamines. Inhaled cardioselective bronchodilators (e.g. Alupent, Salbutamol) are the preferred agents, with aminophylline a second choice.\u00a0</li> <li>Lavage is indicated in patients who require decontamination; ensure use of cuffed endotracheal tube in adult patients.

Therefore emesis should not be induced mechanically or pharmacologically. Mechanical means should be used if it is considered necessary to evacuate the stomach contents; these include gastric lavage after endotracheal intubation.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>A significant number of individuals exposed to mixed trimethylbenzenes complained of nervousness, tension, anxiety and asthmatic bronchitis.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice. Environmental processes may also be important in changing solubilities.\u00a0</p> <p>Even though many metals show few toxic effects at physiological pHs, transformation may introduce new or magnified effects.</p> <p>A metal ion is considered infinitely persistent because it cannot degrade further.</p> <p>The current state of science does not allow for an unambiguous interpretation of various measures of bioaccumulation.</p> <p>The counter-ion may also create health and environmental concerns once isolated from the metal. Under normal physiological conditions the counter-ion may be essentially insoluble and may not be bioavailable.</p> <p>Environmental processes may enhance bioavailability.</p> <p>Copper is unlikely to accumulate in the atmosphere due to a short residence time for airborne copper aerosols. Airborne coppers, however, may be transported over large distances. Copper accumulates significantly in the food chain.</p> <p>\u00a0Drinking Water Standards:</p> <p>3000 ug/l (UK max)</p> <p>2000 ug/l (WHO provisional Guideline)</p> <p>1000 ug/l (WHO level where individuals complain)</p> <p>Soil Guidelines: Dutch Criteria</p> <p>36 mg/kg (target)</p> <p>190 mg/kg (intervention)</p> <p>Air Quality Standards: no data available.</p> <p>\u00a0The toxic effect of copper in the aquatic biota depends on the bio-availability of copper in water which, in turn, depends on its physico-chemical form (ie.speciation). \u00a0Bioavailability is decreased by complexation and adsorption of copper by natural organic matter, iron and manganese hydrated oxides, and chelating agents excreted by algae and other aquatic organisms. Toxicity is also affected by pH and hardness. Total copper is rarely useful as a predictor of toxicity. In natural sea water, more than 98% of copper is organically bound and in river waters a high percentage is often organically bound, but the actual percentage depends on the river water and its pH.</p> <p>\u00a0Copper exhibits significant toxicity in some aquatic organisms. Some algal species are very sensitive to copper with EC50 (96 hour) values as low as 47 ug/litre dissolved copper whilst for other algal species EC50 values of up to 481 ug/litre have been reported. \u00a0However many of the reportedly high EC50 values may arise in experiments conducted with a culture media containing copper-complexing agents such as silicate, iron, manganese and EDTA which reduce bioavailability.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxic effects arising following exposure by aquatic species to copper are typically:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Algae EC50 (96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Daphnia magna LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Amphipods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Gastropods LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Crab larvae LC50 (48-96 h)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>47-481 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>7-54 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>37-183 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>58-112 *</p>  </td> <td> <p>50-100 *</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>* ug/litre</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to concentrations ranging from one to a few hundred micrograms per litre has led to sublethal effects and effects on long-term survival.

Generally, vegetation rooted in soils reflects the soil copper levels in its foliage. This is dependent upon the bioavailability of copper and the physiological requirements of species concerned.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Typical foliar levels of copper are:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Uncontaminated soils (0.3-250 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Contaminated soils \u00a0(150-450 mg/kg)</p>  </td> <td> <p>Mining/smelting soils</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>6.1-25 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>80 mg/kg</p>  </td> <td> <p>300 mg/kg</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Plants rarely show symptoms of toxicity or of adverse growth effects at normal soil concentrations of copper. Crops are often more sensitive to copper than the native flora, so protection levels for agricultural crops range from 25 mg Cu/kg to several hundred mg/kg, depending on country. Chronic and or acute effects on sensitive species occur at copper levels occurring in some soils as a result of human activities such as copper fertiliser addition, and addition of sludge.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>When soil levels exceed 150 mg Cu/kg, native and agricultural species show chronic effects. Soils in the range 500-1000 mg Cu/kg act in a strongly selective fashion allowing the survival of only copper-tolerant species and strains. At 2000 Cu mg/kg most species cannot survive. By 3500 mg Cu/kg areas are largely devoid of vegetation cover. The organic content of the soil appears to be a key factor affecting the bioavailability of copper.\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>On normal forest soils, non-rooted plants such as mosses and lichens show higher copper concentrations. The fruiting bodies and mycorrhizal sheaths of soil fungi associated with higher plants in forests often accumulate copper to much higher levels than plants at the same site.

Consumption of copper-contaminated drinking water has been associated with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. A metallic taste, nausea, vomiting and epigastric burning often occur after ingestion of copper and its derivatives. The vomitus is usually green/blue and discolours contaminated skin. Acute poisonings from the ingestion of copper salts are rare due to their prompt removal by vomiting. Vomiting is due mainly to the local and astringent action of copper ion on the stomach and bowel. Emesis usually occurs within 5 to 10 minutes but may be delayed if food is present in the stomach. Should vomiting not occur, or is delayed, gradual absorption from the bowel may result in systemic poisoning with death, possibly, following within several days. Apparent recovery may be followed by lethal relapse. Systemic effects of copper resemble other heavy metal poisonings and produce wide-spread capillary damage, kidney and liver damage and central nervous system excitation followed by depression. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) has been described in acute human poisoning. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products.]</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Other symptoms of copper poisoning include lethargy, neurotoxicity, and increased blood pressure and respiratory rates. Coma and death have followed attempted suicides using solutions of copper sulfate. Copper is an essential element and most animal tissues have measurable amounts of copper associated with them. Humans have evolved mechanisms which maintain is availability whilst limiting its toxicity (homeostasis). Copper is initially bound in the body to a blood-borne protein, serum albumin and thereafter is more firmly bound to another protein, alpha-ceruloplasmin. Such binding effectively \"inactivates\" the copper, thus reducing its potential to produce toxic damage. In healthy individuals, bound copper can reach relatively high levels without producing adverse health effects. Excretion in the bile represents the major pathway by which copper is removed from the body when it reaches potentially toxic levels. Copper may also be stored in the liver and bone marrow where it is bound to another protein, metallothionein. A combination of binding and excretion ensures that the body is able to tolerate relatively high loadings of copper.</p>",

The larger particles, above 5 micron, are nose and throat irritants. Smaller particles however, may cause lung deterioration. Particles of less than 1.5 micron can be trapped in the lungs and, dependent on the nature of the particle, may give rise to further serious health consequences.</p> <p>Metals are widely distributed in the environment and are not biodegradable. Biologically, many metals are essential to living systems and are involved in a variety of cellular, physiological, and structural functions. They often are cofactors of enzymes, and play a role in transcriptional control, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport and delivery. Although all metals are potentially toxic at some level, some are highly toxic at relatively low levels. Moreover, in some cases the same metal can be essential at low levels and toxic at higher levels, or it may be toxic via one route of entry but not another. Toxic effects of some metals are associated with disruption of functions of essential metals. Metals may have a range of effects, including cancer, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity. Biological half lives of metals vary greatly, from hours to years. Furthermore, the half life of a given metal varies in different tissues. Lead has a half life of 14 days in soft tissues and 20 years in bone.\u00a0</p> <p>In considering how to evaluate the toxicity of metals of potential concern, a number of aspects of metal toxicity should be kept in mind:\u00a0</p> <p>Different species vary in their responses to different metals; in some cases, humans are more sensitive than rodents. Thus, there is a need for broad-based testing of metals;\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>The route of exposure may affect the dose and site where the metal concentrates, and thus the observed toxic effects;\u00a0</li> <li>Metal-metal interactions can reduce or enhance toxicity; biotransformation can reduce or enhance toxicity;\u00a0</li> <li>It is difficult to predict the toxicity of one metal based on the adverse effects of another; in trying to evaluate the toxicity of one particular metal compound, predictions based on similar compounds of the same metal may be valid.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic copper poisoning is rarely recognised in man although in one instance, at least, symptoms more commonly associated with exposures to mercury, namely infantile acrodynia (pink disease), have been described. Tissue damage of mucous membranes may follow chronic dust exposure. A hazardous situation is exposure of a worker with the rare hereditary condition (Wilson's disease or hereditary hepatolenticular degeneration) to copper exposure which may cause liver, kidney, CNS, bone and sight damage and is potentially lethal. Haemolytic anaemia (a result of red-blood cell damage) is common in cows and sheep poisoned by copper derivatives. Overdosing of copper feed supplements has resulted in pigmentary cirrhosis of the liver. [GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products]</p>",
