Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The additional refining consists of a series of extractive or\r\ntransforming processes that improve the base oils\u2019 performance characteristics\r\nand remove, reduce or transform undesirable components. The removed and\r\ntransformed materials are deemed undesirable because they are either\r\ndeleterious to product performance and/or are potentially carcinogenic. The\r\nundesirable components include aromatics, metals, waxes, and trace components\r\ncausing unwanted colors or odors (i.e. sulfur). Premium lube base stocks have\r\nlow levels of nitrogen and sulfur, the hydrocarbons present being predominantly\r\nnaphthenics and isoparaffins. Naphthenics have good low temperature viscosity\r\nand oxidative stability while isoparaffins possess excellent oxidation\r\nstability, good viscosity characteristics, and low volatility. Normal\r\nparaffins, however, have poor low temperature properties. Aromatics have high\r\nvolatility and poor oxidative stability in most lubricant applications, and\r\ntherefore, processing is directed toward reducing the aromatics content.

In one study, the experimentally measured vapour pressure of a solvent-dewaxed heavy paraffinic distillate base oil was 1.7 x 10exp-4 Pa . Since base oils are mixtures of C15 to C50 paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbon isomers, representative components of those structures were selected to calculate a range of vapor pressures. The estimated vapor pressure values for these selected components of base oils ranged from 4.5 x 10exp-1 Pa to 2 x 10exp-13Pa. Based on Dalton's Law the expected total vapour pressure for base oils would fall well below minimum levels (10exp-5 Pa) of recommended experimental procedures.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Partition Coefficient (log Kow):\u00a0</b>In mixtures such as the base oils, the percent distribution of the hydrocarbon groups (i.e., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and the carbon chain lengths determines in-part the partitioning characteristics of the mixture. Generally, hydrocarbon chains with fewer carbon atoms tend to have lower partition coefficients than those with higher carbon numbers .However, due to their complex composition, unequivocal determination of the log Kow of these hydrocarbon mixtures cannot be made. Rather, partition coefficients of selected C15 chain-length hydrocarbon structures representing paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic constituents in base oil lubricants were modelled . Results showed typical log Kow values from 4.9 to 7.7, which were consistent with values of &gt;4 for lubricating oil basestocks\u00a0</p> <p><b>Water Solubility:</b>When released to water, base oils will float and spread at a rate that is viscosity dependent. While water solubility of base oils is typically very low, individual hydrocarbons exhibit a wide range of solubility depending on molecular weight and degree of unsaturation. Decreasing molecular weight (i.e., carbon number) and increasing levels of unsaturation increases the water solubility of these materials. As noted for partition coefficient, the water solubility of lubricating base oils cannot be determined due to their complex mixture characteristics. Therefore, the water solubility of individual C15 hydrocarbons representing the different groups making up base oils (i.e., linear and branched paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) was modelled. Based on water solubility modelling of those groups, aqueous solubilities are typically much less than 1 ppm. (0.003-0.63 mg/l)</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Chemicals having potential to photolyse have UV/visible absorption maxima in the range of 290 to 800 nm. Some chemicals have absorption maxima significantly below 290 nm and consequently cannot undergo direct photolysis in sunlight (e.g. chemicals such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, saturated alcohols, and saturated acids). Most hydrocarbon constituents of the materials in this category are not expected to photolyse since they do not show absorbance within the 290-800 nm range. However, photodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can occur and may be a significant degradation pathway for these constituents of lubricating base oils. The degree and rate at which PAHs may photodegrade depend upon whether conditions allow penetration of light with sufficient energy to effect a change. For example,polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) compounds bound to sediments may persist due to a lack of sufficient light penetration\u00a0</p> <p>Atmospheric gas-phase reactions can occur between organic chemicals and reactive molecules such as photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen oxides. Atmospheric oxidation as a result of radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but indirect degradation. In general, lubricating base oils have low vapour pressures and volatilisation is not expected to be a significant removal mechanism for the majority of the hydrocarbon components. However, some components (e.g., C15 branched paraffins and naphthenes) appear to have the potential to volatilise Atmospheric half-lives of 0.10 to 0.66 days have been calculated for representative C15 hydrocarbon components of lubricating base oils\u00a0</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Chemicals that have a potential to hydrolyze include alkyl halides, amides, carbamates, carboxylic acid esters and lactones, epoxides, phosphate esters, and sulfonic acid esters. Because lubricating base oils do not contain significant levels of these functional groups, materials in the lubricating base oils category are not subject to hydrolysis\u00a0</p> <p><b>Chemical Transport and Distribution in the Environment :\u00a0</b>Based on the physical-chemical characteristics of component hydrocarbons in lubricating base oils, the lower molecular weight components are expected to have the highest vapour pressures and water solubilities, and the lowest partition coefficients. These factors enhance the potential for widespread distribution in the environment. To gain an understanding of the potential transport and distribution of lubricating base oil components, the EQC (Equilibrium Criterion) model was used to characterize the environmental distribution of different C15 compounds representing different structures found in lube oils (e.g., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics). The modelling found partitioning to soil or air is the ultimate fate of these C15 compounds. Aromatic compounds partition principally to soil. Linear paraffins partition mostly to soil, while branching appears to allow greater distribution to air. Naphthenes distribute to both soil and air, with increasing proportions in soil for components with the greater number of ring structures. Because the modelling does not take into account degradation factors, levels modelled in the atmosphere are likely overstated in light of the tendency for indirect photodegradation to occur.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation: \u00a0T</b>he extent of biodegradation measured for a particular lubricating oil basestock is dependent not only on the procedure used but also on how the sample is presented in the biodegradation test. Lubricant base oils typically are not readily biodegradable in standard 28-day tests. However, since the oils consist primarily of hydrocarbons that are ultimately assimilated by microorganisms, and therefore inherently biodegradable. Twenty-eight biodegradability studies have been reported for a variety of lubricating base oils. Based on the results of ultimate biodegradability tests using modified Sturm and manometric respirometry testing the base oils are expected to be, for the most part, inherently biodegradable. Biodegradation rates found using the modified Sturm procedure ranged from 1.5 to 29%. Results from the manometric respirometry tests on similar materials showed biodegradation rates from 31 to 50%. Biodegradation rates measured in 21-day CEC tests for similar materials ranged from 13 to 79%.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Numerous acute studies covering fish, invertebrates, and algae have been conducted to assess the ecotoxicity of various lubricating base oils. None of these studies have shown evidence of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. Eight, 7-day exposure studies using rainbow trout failed to demonstrate toxicity when tested up to the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Three, 96-hour tests with rainbow trout also failed to show any toxic effects when tested up to 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Similarly, three 96-hour tests with fathead minnows at a maximum test concentration of 100 mg/L water accommodated fractions (WAF) showed no adverse effects. Two species of aquatic invertebrates (Daphnia magna and Gammarus sp.) were exposed to WAF solutions up to 10,000 mg/L for 48 and 96-hours, respectively, with no adverse effects being observed. \u00a0Four-day exposures of the freshwater green alga (Scenedesmus subspicatus) to 500 mg/L WAF solutions failed to show adverse effects on growth rate and algal cell densities in four studies\u00a0</p> <p>Multiple chronic ecotoxicity studies have shown no adverse effects to daphnid survival or reproduction. In 10 of 11 chronic studies, daphnids were exposed for 21 days to WAF preparations of lubricating base oils with no ill effects on survival or reproduction at the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L. One test detected a reduction in reproduction at 1000 mg/L. \u00a0Additional data support findings of no chronic toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fish. No observed effect levels ranged from 550 to 5,000 mg/L when tested as either dispersions or WAFs.\u00a0</p> <p>The data described above are supported by studies on a homologous series of alkanes. The author concluded that the water solubility of carbon chains .C10 is too limited to elicit acute toxicity. This also was shown for alkylbenzene compounds having carbon numbers .C15. Since base oils consist of carbon compounds of C15 to C50, component hydrocarbons that are of acute toxicological concern are, for the most part, absent in these materials. Similarly, due to their low solubility, the alkylated two to three ring polyaromatic components in base oils are not expected to cause acute or chronic toxicity. This lack of toxicity is borne out in the results of the reported studies.\u00a0</p> <p>The effects of crude and refined oils on organisms found in fresh and sea water ha been extensively reviewed.</p> <p>sea water. Where spillages occur the non-mobile species suffer the greatest mortality, whereas fish species can often escape from the affected region. The extent of the initial mortality depends on the chemical nature of the oil, the location, and the physical conditions, particularly the temperature and wind velocity. Most affected freshwater and marine communities recover from the effects of an oil spill within a year. The occurrence of biogenic hydrocarbons in the world's oceans is well recorded. They have the characteristic isoprenoid structure, and measurements made in water columns indicate a background concentration of 1.0 to 10 ul/l. The higher molecular weight materials are dispersed as particles, with the highest concentrations of about 20 ul/l occurring in the top 3 mm layer of water.</p> <p>A wide variation in the response of organisms to oil exposures has been noted. The larvae of fish and crustaceans appear to be most susceptible to the water-soluble fraction of crude oil. Exposures of plankton and algae have indicated that certain species of diatoms and green algae are inhibited, whereas microflagellates are not.</p> <p>For the most part, molluscs and most intertidal worm species appear to be tolerant of oil contamination.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>For petroleum distillates:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Environmental fate:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>When petroleum substances are\nreleased into the environment, four major fate processes will take place:\ndissolution in water, volatilization, biodegradation and adsorption.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Toxicity and Irritation data for petroleum-based mineral oils are related to chemical components and vary as does the composition and source of the original crude.</p> <p>A small but definite risk of occupational skin cancer occurs in workers exposed to persistent skin contamination by oils over a period of years.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Inhalation of oil droplets/ aerosols may cause discomfort and may produce chemical pneumonitis.</p>",

Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Petroleum hydrocarbons may produce pain after direct contact with the eyes. Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Limited evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis.

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Principal route of exposure is by skin contact; lesser exposures include inhalation of fumes from hot oils, oil mists or droplets. Prolonged contact with mineral oils carries with it the risk of skin conditions such as oil folliculitis, eczematous dermatitis, pigmentation of the face (melanosis) and warts on the sole of the foot (plantar warts). With highly refined mineral oils no appreciable systemic effects appear to result through skin absorption.</p> <p>\u00a0Exposure to oil mists frequently elicits respiratory conditions, such as asthma; the provoking agent is probably an additive. High oil mist concentrations may produce lipoid pneumonia although clinical evidence is equivocal. In animals exposed to concentrations of 100 mg/m3 oil mist, for periods of 12 to 26 months, the activity of lung and serum alkaline phosphatase enzyme was raised; 5 mg/m3 oil mist did not produce this response. These enzyme changes are sensitive early indicators of lung damage. Workers exposed to vapours of mineral oil and kerosene for 5 to 35 years showed an increased prevalence of slight basal lung fibrosis.</p> <p>\u00a0Many studies have linked cancers of the skin and scrotum with mineral oil exposure. Contaminants in the form of additives and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs - as in the crude base stock) are probably responsible. PAH levels are higher in aromatic process oils/used/reclaimed motor oils. Subchronic 90-day feeding studies conducted on male and female rats on highly refined white mineral oils and waxes found that higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons (microcrystalline waxes and the higher viscosity oils) were without biological effects. Paraffin waxes and low- to mid viscosity oils produced biological effects that were inversely proportional to molecular weight, viscosity and melting point: oil-type and processing did not appear to be determinants. Biological effects were more pronounced in females than in males. Effects occurred mainly in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes and included increased organ weights, microscopic inflammatory changes, and evidence for the presence of saturated mineral hydrocarbons in affected tissues. Inflammation of the cardiac mitral valve was also observed at high doses in rats treated with paraffin waxes.</p> <p>Smith J.H., et al: Toxicologic Pathology: 24, 2, 214-230, 1996</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Principal route of exposure is by skin contact; lesser exposures include inhalation of fumes from hot oils, oil mists or droplets.

Because of\r\nthe wide range of raw materials used, blown oils find uses in many diverse\r\nindustries, for example blown linseed oils are used in the surface coatings\r\nindustry and blown rapeseed oils are often used in lubricants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Oils are &quot;blown&quot; through partial\r\noxidation of the oil at elevated temperatures. A typical blowing process\r\ninvolves heating the oil to 70 to 120 deg C (158 to 248 deg F) and passing air\r\nthrough the liquid.The modification causes the formation of C-O-C and C-C cross\r\nlinks, and hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Blown oils are chemically different from\r\noils modified only by heating,which are known as stand oils.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Blown oil polymerises by cross-linking\r\nacross the double bonds but there are oxygen molecules incorporated into the\r\ncross-linking bond in contrast to standing oils. Peroxide, hydroperoxide and\r\nhydroxyl groups are also present. Blown oils are also known as oxidised,\r\nthickened and oxidatively polymerised oils.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Both types of oil , blown and standing,\r\nare, generally, manufactured to viscosity specifications. </span></p>|Lubricant; food processing aid in putties and caulking compounds",

Once released to surface waters and moist soils their fate depends on solubility and dissociation in water. Environmental processes (such as oxidation and the presence of acids or bases) may transform insoluble metals to more soluble ionic forms. Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.

The lungs of victims contain no classical silicotic nodules or only a few, microscopic abortive nodules, whereas the air spaces are diffusively filled and distended with silica-containing, lipoprotein paste in which degenerating and necrotic macrophages are sometimes discernible - the condition is sometimes described as alveolar lipoproteinosis. The uptake of silica particles by macrophages and lysosymal incorporation, is followed by rupture of the lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal enzymes into cytoplasm of the macrophage.

Smoking increases this risk. Classic silicosis\r\nis a chronic disease characterised by the formation of scattered, rounded or\r\nstellate silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs ranging from\r\nmicroscopic to 1.0 cm or more. The nodules isolate the inhaled silica particles\r\nand protect the surrounding normal and functioning tissue from continuing\r\ninjury. Simple silicosis (in which the nodules are less than 1.0 cm in\r\ndiameter) is generally asymptomatic but may be slowly progressive even in the\r\nabsence of continuing exposure. Simple silicosis can develop in complicated\r\nsilicoses (in which nodules are greater than 1.0 cm in diameter) and can\r\nproduce disabilities including an associated tuberculous infection (which 50\r\nyears ago accounted for 75% of the deaths among silicotic workers). Crystalline\r\nsilica deposited in the lungs causes epithelial and macrophage injury and\r\nactivation. Crystalline silica translocates to the interstitium and the\r\nregional lymph nodes and cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells in a dose\r\ndependent manner. In humans, a large fraction of crystalline silica persists in\r\nthe lungs. The question of potential carcinogenicity associated with chronic\r\ninhalation of crystalline silica remains equivocal with some studies supporting\r\nthe proposition and others finding no significant association. The results of\r\nrecent epidemiological studies suggest that lung cancer risk is elevated only\r\nin those patients with overt silicosis. A relatively large number of\r\nepidemiological studies have been undertaken and in some, increased risk\r\ngradients have been observed in relation to dose surrogates - cumulative\r\nexposure, duration of exposure, the presence of radiographically defined\r\nsilicosis, and peak intensity exposure.
