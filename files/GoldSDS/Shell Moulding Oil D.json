The kerosenes, are further treated by a variety of processes (including hydrogenation) to remove or reduce the level of sulfur, nitrogen or olefinic materials. The precise composition of any particular kerosene will depend on the crude oil from which it was derived and on the refinery processes used for its production.</p> <p>The streams are complex mixtures of paraffinic, isoparaffinic, naphthenic (cycloparaffinic) and aromatic (mainly alkylbenzene) hydrocarbons ranging in carbon number from C5-25 (mainly C9-16) and boil in the range 145 to 300 C. Olefins constitute less than 5% of the mixtures, by volume, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (3-7 fused rings) content is typically very low. Jet fuels (e.g., Jet A, JP-8, etc.) are included because they are composed almost entirely of two of these streams straight run kerosene (CAS No. 8008-20-6) or hydrodesulfurised kerosene (CAS No. 64742-81-0)\u00a0</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate</b></p> <p><b>Terrestrial fate</b>:: If released to soil, kerosene is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Kerosene is a mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons, chiefly C10-C16 alkanes, and a typical analysis includes the identification of n-dodecane, alkyl benzene derivatives, naphthalene, and tetrahydronaphthalenes. Soil adsorption coefficients for these representative classes of compounds ranging from 1500 to 17,000 obtained from estimated log octanol/water partition coefficients of 3.3 to 5.25 indicate that some components of kerosene may display low mobility and some will be essentially immobile in soil. The vapour pressure of kerosene, 0.48 mm Hg indicates that it may rapidly volatilise from dry soil to the atmosphere although its expected strong adsorption to soil may significantly attenuate the rate of this process.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:</b>\u00a0: If released to water, kerosene is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. \u00a0Bioconcentration factors for components of kerosene were estimated to be 190 to 5800 (based on \u00a0estimated log octanol/water partition coefficients of 3.3 to 5.25) indicating that some components of kerosene may significantly bioconcentrate in fish and aquatic organisms. Soil adsorption coefficients for kerosene ranging from 1500 to 17,000 indicate that it may strongly adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of kerosene from a model river 1 m deep flowing at 1 m/sec with a wind speed of 3 m/sec which does not take into account adsorptive processes is 3-6 hrs. The estimated half-life for volatilisation of kerosene from a model lake, which accounts for adsorptive processes, is &gt;130 days.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate\u00a0</b>If released to the atmosphere, kerosene may undergo oxidation by a gas-phase reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. Estimated rate constants for the oxidation of these representative classes of compounds ranging from 1.2-2.2x10-11 cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C translates to an atmospheric half-life for kerosene of 2-3.4 days using an average atmospheric hydroxyl radical concentration of 5x10+5 molec/cu-cm.\u00a0</p> <p>The stability of kerosene in soils as affected by volatilization was determined in a laboratory column experiment by following the losses in the total concentration and the change in composition of the residuals in a dune sand, a loamy sand, and a silty loam soil during a 50 day period. Seven major compounds ranging between C9 and C15 were selected from a large variety of hydrocarbons forming kerosene and their presence in the remaining petroleum product was determined. The change in composition of kerosene during the experimental period was determined by gas chromatography and related to the seven major compounds selected. The experimental conditions air-dry soil and no subsequent addition of water excluded both biodegradative and leaching losses. The losses of kerosene in air-dried soil columns during the 50-day experimental period and the changes in the composition of the remaining residues due to volatilization are reported. The volatilization of all the components determined was greater from the dune sand and loamy sand soils than from the silty loam soil. It was assumed that the reason for this behavior was that the dune sand and the loamy sand soils contain a greater proportion of large pores (&gt; 4.5 um) than the silty loam soil, even though the total porosity of the loamy sand and the silty loam is similar. In all the soils in the experiment, the components with a high carbon number formed the main fraction of the kerosene residues after 50 days of incubation.\u00a0</p> <p>Voltatilisation in the air phase and saturated mass flow of kerosene in the three sands ((fine, medium and coarse) were studied in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Volatilisation was the major physico-chemical process affecting the fate of kerosene in the inert porous medium. During volatilization the liquid kerosene changed its composition by gradually losing its light components (C9-C13), and the viscosity of the remaining liquid kerosene increased. The increase in viscosity led to a decrease in the infiltration rate, for example, by about 20% when the viscosity increased\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Data for various kerosene streams is available. Kerosenes and jet fuels are moderately to acutely toxicity to aquatic organisms \u00a0All studies used exposures to water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of the process streams Each of the different streams exhibited similar toxicity to rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>, 96-hour LC 50 values of 18 - 25 mg/L); likewise, toxicity to the alga\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornutum,\u00a0</i>with 96-hour growth rate EC50 values of 5.0 - 6.2 mg/L and biomass inhibition EC50 values of 5.9 - 11 mg/L, did not vary greatly among the streams. There was considerable variation in the measured toxicity of the category member (CAS No. 64742-81-0) to daphnids (<i>Daphnia magna</i>) when evaluated in different tests; in the test using daily renewal of freshly-prepared WAF , the 48-hr EC50 was estimated at 1.4 mg/L, while in the test where solution was not renewed it was estimated at between 40 and 89 mg/L. In spite of daily renewal, a sample of sweetened kerosene (CAS No. 91770-15-9) exhibited considerably less toxicity than the hydrodesulfurised and hydrocracked materials tested in the same laboratory , indicating the difference in that measurement is due to the nature of the sample rather than variations in the testing approach.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>for fuels, diesel\u00a0</p> <p>TLV TWA: 15 ppm (vapour); 100 mg/m3 (inhalable fraction and vapour) (skin)</p> <p>OEL TWA: 5 mg/m3 (stable aerosol) Exxon Mobil 2009</p> <p>OEL TWA: 200 mg/m3 (vapour) Exxon Mobil 2009</p> <p><br /></p> <p>for fuels, diesel, no. 2 [inhalable total hydrocarbon, vapour and aerosol]</p> <p>TLV TWA 100 mg/m3 (skin)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>for kerosine (petroleum), hydrosulfurized</p> <p>TLV TWA: 200 mg/m3 (skin)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Vapour concentrations above the recommended exposure levels are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract, may cause headaches and dizziness, are anaesthetic and may have other central nervous system effects.</p> <p>Diesel fuel is carcinogenic in animal tests and causes mutations in vitro.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Fumes from diesel combustion are extremely variable in composition, may contain particulates, unburnt components and may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>Vapour or mist may produce respiratory tract irritation.

Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause drying with cracking, irritation and possible dermatitis following.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact with diesel fuel may cause defatting and irritation of follicles with blocked sebaceous glands resulting in pimples and spots appearing on arms and legs. Hyperkeratosis has been described in engine drivers exposed occupationally to diesel fuels. Repeated application to rabbit skin produces mortalities (8 ml/kg). The primary cause of death was depression and anorexia which were induced by dermal irritation followed by infection; systemic intoxication did not appear to be a factor. Autopsy showed liver and kidney effects.</p> <p>Long term exposure to mist / fumes or ingestion may cause severe central nervous system deficiencies. Chronic exposure or voluntary sniffing can lead to bone marrow deficiencies. [CCINFO]</p> <p>Animal studies confirm an association between cancer, primarily of the lung and inhalation of whole diesel exhaust</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
