Triethylene- and tetraethylene- glycol ethers represent typical members of the category. All category members can be represented by the generic molecular formula:</p> <p>HO(CH2CH2O)nR - n=2,3,4,5,6 and higher ethylene units and R=alkyl(methyl, ethyl, butyl etc.)</p> <p>All are high boiling liquids of low volatility and high water solubility. Higher molecular weight species and surrogates may be solids at ambient temperatures.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Estimated photodegradation hydroxyl radical rate constants \u00a0for category members are in close agreement. Photodegradation half-lives of triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE), tetraethylene glycol methyl ether (TetraME), and tetraethylene glycol butyl ether (TetraBE) (estimated using the EPIWIN/AOP model) have atmospheric photodegradation half-lives of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.0 hours respectively.</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Ether groups are generally stable to water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. The ether function is hydrolysed by heating in the presence of halogen acids, particularly hydrogen iodide.</p> <p><b>Volatilisation</b>: The category members are highly soluble to miscible in water, possess high boiling points (in excess of 250 C) and low vapour pressures. The estimated Henry's Law Constants, fall in the narrow range of 3.54 E-14 to 3.67 E-13 m3* atm/mol at 25 C point to a limited volatilisation potential.</p> <p><b>Transport between Environmental Compartments:\u00a0</b>The ethers in this category possess physical properties that suggest that once they enter the aqueous compartment, they tend to remain dissolved in water. Soil/sediment partition coefficients (Koc) of 10 have been estimated for TGBE, TetraME and TetraBE . These results suggest that the category members have uniformly high soil mobility. Thus, these products can leach from soil deposits to groundwater, but can also be transported to environments where aerobic biodegradation can take place.</p> <p><b>Biodegradation:\u00a0</b>When released to water, some studies show that biodegradation of category members is reasonably rapid . OECD guideline studies indicate biodegradability (&gt; 90%) for TGBE (ready or inherent) and TetraME (inherent). However,another comparative biodegradation study of triethylene glycol methyl ether (TGME), triethylene glycol ethyl ether (TGEE) and triethylene glycol butyl ether (TGBE) indicate slower rates of biodegradation (from 47-71%). Altogether, the data suggest that different study methodologies provide variable results for the tri- and tetraethylene glycol ethers. No category members or surrogates that were tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes.</p> <p><b>Bioaccumulation:\u00a0</b>The category members have a limited potential to bioaccumulate (based on log Kow's ranging from -1.73 to +0.51, 20 C), and predicted bioconcentration factors, log BCF = ca. 0.50</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The data suggest that trimethyl, -ethyl and -butyl ethers and are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species.</p> <p>The LC50 values for fish, Daphnia, and algae are 2,400 mg/l, \u00a02,210 mg/l, and &gt; 500 mg/l, respectively. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers. Due to the structural and physical similarities of TetraME and TetraBE with the other glycol ethers in the category, it is likely that these glycol ethers are also of low toxicity to aquatic species</p> <p>The toxicity of TGBE, TetraME, TGEE and TGME to bacteria also has been tested. In sewer microorganisms exposed to TGBE, TGEE and TGME for 16 hours, the LD50 values were &gt; 5,000, &gt;10,000 and &gt;5,000 mg/l, respectively. The concentration of TetraME required to cause inhibition of respiration of activated sludge is reportedly &gt; 12,500 mg/kg for 3 hours\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for alcohol ethoxylates</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Environmental fate:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Alcohol (alkyl) ethoxylates (AEs) are generally biodegradable and do not persist for any substantial period in the environment. They are not usually present a concentrations which might produce problems. Contamination of natural waters, however, should be avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The biodegradability of the alcohol ethoxylates (AE) is relatively unaffected by the alkyl carbon chain length and the number of EO units. The linear AE are normally easily degraded under aerobic conditions. Only small differences are seen in the time needed for ultimate degradation of linear AE with different alkyl chain lengths. AE with a typical alkyl chain (e.g., C12 to C15) will normally reach more than 60% degradation in standardized tests for \"ready\" biodegradability. The rate of biodegradation may however be determined by the length of the ethylene oxide (EO) chain. Longer EO chains decrease the bioavailability of the AE (to microorganism) due to increased hydrophilicity and molecular size, which limits the transport of the molecule through the cell wall. The biodegradation of branched AE tends to be slower than biodegradation of linear AE. The biodegradability of AE depends on degree and structure of the branching. The general trend is that the biodegradation decreases considerably with an increasing branching of the carbon chain. The biodegradability of alcohol alkoxylates (AA), similarly, generally decreases with an increasing number of PO units. AA containing 6 PO units did not pass the level required for ready biodegradability whereas the same alcohol containing 2 PO units attained 83% ThOD in the closed bottle test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The mineralization observed in experiments with 14C-labelled surfactants suggests that almost complete degradation of linear AE may be expected in anaerobic digesters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Available information suggests that alcohol ethoxylates can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic organisms. These effects vary by carbon chain length. Typical alcohol ethoxylate surfactant chain length ranges from 9 to 18 carbons and 3 to 8 ethoxylate groups. Toxicity generally declines as the number of ethoxylates increases</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A summary of chronic toxicity data from 60 studies conducted between 1977 and 2004 on fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plant and algae species states that alcohol ethoxylates\u2019 effects on aquatic species include reduced growth rates, impaired reproduction, and reduced survival of neonates, as well as acute mortality. Alcohol ethoxylates may cause diminished growth rates and reduced cell counts in algae species at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg/L .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The concentrations at which alcohol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality in aquatic species are similar to the concentrations at which nonylphenol ethoxylates lead to acute mortality. However, alcohol ethoxylates degrade more quickly in the aquatic environment to relatively non-toxic compounds, whereas nonylphenol ethoxylate degradation typically yields nonylphenol, which is toxic as well as persistent in the aquatic environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0Algae constitute the group of aquatic organisms which appears to be the most sensitive to AE. The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. For the linear AE, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length of C13 ) and decreasing EO chain length. The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to invertebrates varies with EC50 values from 0.1 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.5 mg/l to 50 mg/l for the branched types. The toxicity is species specific and may vary between 0.29 mg/l to 270 mg/l for the same linear AE The most commonly used invertebrates for testing are\u00a0Daphnia magna\u00a0and\u00a0Daphnia pulex, and they are also among the most sensitive invertebrates to AE. Apparently, the toxicity of AE to invertebrates was not related to hydrophobicity as it is the case for algae. Some AE are very toxic to invertebrates, i.e., linear AE of C12-15 EO1-8 and branched AE with a low degree of branching, i.e. &lt; 10-25%. Branching of the alkyl chain reduces the toxicity of AE to invertebrates as also observed for algae.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The acute toxicity of AE to fish varies with LC50 values from 0.4 mg/l to more than 100 mg/l for the linear types and from 0.25 mg/l to 40 mg/l for the branched AE. For linear AE the toxicity increases with decreasing EO units. AE containing 7-11 EO groups are considered to be very toxic to fish (EC/LC50: 1 mg/l).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special interest are the aryl alcohol ethoxylates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A EU Risk Assessment Report (RAR) concluded that octyl- and nonyl- phenol ethoxylates are\u00a0not readily biodegradable but are inherently biodegradable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As a group, these materials are generally toxic to fish with LC50s ranging, typically, between 1-6 mg/l.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Of special concern are the following families which are classified as\u00a0\"Environmentally Hazardous Substances\"\u00a0(Dangerous Goods Class 9) by either or both the ADR (Accord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Merchandises Dangerous par Route) and the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C 6-17 (secondary) with 3-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C12-15 with 1-3 moles of ethoxylation (1-6 moles of ethoxylation IMDG)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">alcohols C13-15 with 1-6 moles of ethoxylation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">New aquatic data suggests that alcohols C 8-9 branched with 3-10 moles of ethoxylation alcohols C 8-9 branched with &gt; 10 moles of ethoxylation should also be classified as\u00a0'harmful to the environment\".</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These alcohols may also be found linked to aromatic structures (in nonylphenol ethoxylates for example).

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood - local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. \u00a0Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). \u00a0Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. \u00a0The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. \u00a0Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

The alpha form, which is thermodynamically favored during synthesis, consists of a secondary alcohol configuration. The beta form consists of a primary alcohol. The two isomeric forms are shown above. The di- and tripropylene glycol ethers may form up to 4 and 8 isomeric forms, respectively. Even so, all isomers exhibit either the \"alpha\" or \"beta\" configuration, existing as secondary or primary alcohols, respectively. The distribution of isomeric forms for the di- and tripropylene glycols, as with the mono-PGEs, also results in predominantly the alpha form (i.e., a secondary alcohol). It should be noted that only the alpha isomer and isomeric mixtures (consisting predominantly of the alpha isomer) are produced commercially; the purified beta isomer is not produced at this time.</p>|Clear, colourless flammable liquid; mixes with water. mild odour.

                "Environment": "<p>For glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Ether groups are generally stable to hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. OECD guideline studies indicate ready biodegradability for several glycol ethers although higher molecular weight species seem to biodegrade at a slower rate. No glycol ethers that have been tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes. Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr). When released to water, glycol ethers undergo biodegradation (typically 47-92% after 8-21 days) and have a low potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow ranges from -1.73 to +0.51).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic toxicity data indicate that the tri- and tetra ethylene glycol ethers are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers.</p> <p>Glycols exert a high oxygen demand for decomposition and once released to the environments cause the death of aquatic organisms if dissolved oxygen is depleted.</p> <p>for propylene glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Most are liquids at room temperature and all are water-soluble.</p> <p>Typical propylene glycol ethers include propylene glycol n-butyl ether (PnB); dipropylene glycol n-butyl ether (DPnB); dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate (DPMA); tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TPM)</p> <p>Environmental fate: Log octanol-water partition coefficients (log Kow's) range from 0.309 for TPM to 1.523 for DPnB. Calculated BCFs range from 1.47 for DPnB to 3.16 for DPMA and TPM, indicating low bioaccumulation. Henry's Law Constants, which indicate propensity to partition from water to air, are low for all category members, ranging from 5.7 x 10-9 atm-m3/mole for TPM to 2.7 x10-9 atm-m3/mole for PnB. Fugacity modeling indicates that most propylene glycol ethers are likely to partition roughly equally into the soil and water compartments in the environment with small to negligible amounts remaining in other environmental compartments (air, sediment, and aquatic biota). Propylene glycol ethers are unlikely to persist in the environment. Once in air, the half-life of the category members due to direct reactions with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals, range from 2.0 hours for TPM to 4.6 hours for PnB. In water, most \u00a0members of this family \u00a0are \"readily biodegradable\" under aerobic conditions. (DPMA degraded within 28 days (and within the specified 10-day window) but only using pre-adapted or \"acclimated\" inoculum.). In soil, biodegradation is rapid for PM and PMA.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute aquatic toxicity testing indicates low toxicity for both ethers and acetates.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Studies with some glycol ethers (principally the monoethylene glycols) and their esters indicate reproductive changes, testicular atrophy, infertility and kidney function changes. The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p>",

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture.

Airborne concentrations must be maintained as low as is practically possible and occupational exposure must be kept to a minimum.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0The ACGIH occupational exposure standard for Particles Not Otherwise Specified (P.N.O.S) does NOT apply.</p> <p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness. The latter substances are not classified as asthmagens or\r\nrespiratory sensitisers</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Wherever\u00a0 it is reasonably\r\npracticable, exposure to substances that can cuase occupational asthma should\r\nbe prevented.

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Sequestering agents are occasionally used in therapies for various forms of poisoning and are normally injected intravenously. A systemic reaction known as the \"excessive chelation syndrome\" consists mainly of malaise, fatigue, thirst and parathesias, followed by chills and fever. Myalgia, headache, anorexia, nausea and occasionally marked urinary frequency and urgency may also occur. Minor reactions resembling those produced by histamine or the common cold are sometimes seen.</p> <p>Parenteral administration of EDTA and its salts in high doses may produce severe renal lesions with tubular necrosis, internal haemorrhage, transient bone marrow depression and life-threatening hypocalcaemia. Prolonged parenteral exposures produce electrolyte imbalance and possible cardiac arrhythmias.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may result in irritation. EDTA and its metal salts do not permeate the cellular membrane to a significant extent; they remain in the extracellular fluid until excreted. \u00a0(ILO Encyclopaedia)</p> <p>NOTE: Conflicting animal test data is available with regard to the teratogenic potential of EDTA sodium salts. \u00a0Some data indicate that teratogenic effects may occur at extremely high maternal doses.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

In addition they function as hair conditioning agents,\r\nfunctional surfactants, thickeners and bacteriostatic agents.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Amphoteric surfactants\r\n(amphiphiles) have dual functional groups (both acidic and basic groups) in the\r\nsame molecule. They are polar substances that have a high solubility in water\r\nbut a poor solubility in most organic solvents. They are electrically neutral\r\n(zwitterions) but carry positive and negative charges on different atoms in an\r\naqueous solution. They exist mostly as zwitterions in a certain pH range but\r\ndepending on the pH value, the substances can have anionic or cationic\r\nproperties outside the zwitterionic range. In the presence of acids, they will\r\naccept the hydrogen ions but they will donate hydrogen ions to the solution in\r\nthe presence of bases, which balances the pH. Such actions make buffer\r\nsolutions which resist change to the pH. Amphoteric (amphiphilic) surfactants\r\nchange their charge according to the pH of the solution; this affects\r\nproperties such as foaming, wetting and detergency through a surface action that\r\nexerts both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. In biochemistry amphoteric\r\nsurfactants are used as\u00a0 detergents for purifying, cleansing and for their\u00a0\r\nantimicrobial effects. Alkylbetaines and amino-oxides are typical amphoteric\r\nsurfactants.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines are primarily used in\r\npersonal care products like, e.g. hair shampoos, liquid soaps, and cleansing\r\nlotions. Other applications include all-purpose cleaning agents, hand\r\ndishwashing agents, and special textile detergents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In chemistry a betaine is any\r\nneutral chemical compound with a positively charged cationic functional group\r\nsuch as a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation (generally: onium ions)\r\nwhich bears no hydrogen atom and with a negatively charged functional group\r\nsuch as a carboxylate group which may not be adjacent to the cationic site. A\r\nbetaine thus may be a specific type of zwitterion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In biological systems, many\r\nnaturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized\r\nor taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic\r\nstress, drought, high salinity or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation\r\nof betaines, non-perturbing to enzyme function, protein structure and membrane\r\nintegrity, permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects\r\nof dehydration. It is also a methyl donor of increasingly recognised\r\nsignificance in biology.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines may function to reduce\r\nthe concentration of homocysteine, a homolog of the naturally occurring amino\r\nacid cysteine. High circulating levels of homocysteine may be harmful to blood\r\nvessels and thus contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. This\r\nhypothesis is controversial as it has not yet been established whether\r\nhomocysteine itself is harmful or is just an indicator of increased risk for\r\ncardiovascular disease</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Phosphonium betaines are\r\nintermediates in the Wittig reaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The addition of betaine to\r\npolymerase chain reactions improves the amplification of DNA by reducing the\r\nformation of secondary structure in GC-rich regions. The addition of betaine\r\nhas been reported to enhance the specificity of the polymerase chain reaction\r\nby eliminating the base pair composition dependence of DNA melting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Most betaines are characterized\r\nby a fully quaternised nitrogen. In alkyl betaines, one of the methyl groups in\r\nthe \u2018betaine\u2019 structure (<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylglycine) is replaced by a linear\r\nalkyl chain. A special type of betaines is the hydroxysulfobetaines in which\r\nthe carboxylic group of alkyl betaine is replaced by sulfonate and a\r\nhydroxy-group is inserted in the hydrophilic part of the molecule. In\r\nalkylamido betaines, an amide group is inserted as a link between the\r\nhydrophobic alkyl chain and the hydrophilic moiety. The most commonly used\r\nalkylamido betaine is alkylamidopropyl betaine (e.g., cocoamidopropyl betaine),\r\nwhereas alkylamidoethyl betaines are used in smaller amounts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Representative structures include</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RN+(CH3)2CH2COO- (alkyl betaine)\r\nand </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">RC(=O)NH(CH3)2N+(CH3)CH3-COO-\r\n(alkylamidopropyl betaine)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines and closely related\r\nsultaines are \"pseudo-amphoteric\" surfactants as the nitrogen moiety\r\nalways has a net positive charge and the molecules can never become anionic at\r\nhigh pHs</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Betaines/ sultaines typically\r\ncontain 6-8% salt (as sodium chloride for example) as by-products of their\r\nsynthesis. These salts act to enlarge the effective size of the surfactant\r\nmicelles and thus viscosity increases</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Since betaines/ sultaines\r\npermanently have positively charged nitrogen, the negatively charged end of the\r\nanionic surfactant associates with it to form a large surfactant complex and\r\nthe viscosity increases.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">These surfactants also have other\r\nbenefits when used in shampoos; they improve foam and can increase hair\r\nconditioning due to their substantively to hair. It has also been reported\r\n(controversially) that they can actually decrease the irritation potential of\r\nanionics (once again due to the formation of a surfactant complex) </span></p>",

Historically, synthetic surfactants were often composed of branched alkyl chains resulting in poor biodegradability which led to concerns about their environmental effects. Today however, many of them, for example those used in large amounts, globally, as detergents, are linear and therefore readily biodegradable and considered to be of rather low risk to the environment. A linear structure of the hydrophobic chain facilitates the approach of microorganism while branching, in particular at the terminal position, inhibits biodegradation. Also, the bioaccumulation potential of surfactants is usually low due to the hydrophilic units. Linear surfactants are not always preferred however, as some branching (that ideally does not hinder ready biodegradability) is often preferable from a performance point of view.  The reduction in waste water of organic contaminants such as surfactants can either be a consequence of adsorption onto sludge or aerobic biodegradation in the biological step. Similar sorption and degradation processes occur in the environment as a consequence of direct release of surfactants into the environment from product use, or through effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants in surface waters or the application of sewage sludge on land. However, a major part of surfactants in waste water will be efficiently eliminated in the sewage treatment plant. Although toxic to various organisms, surfactants in general only have a limited effect on the bacteria in the biological step. There are occasions however, where adverse effects have been noticed due to e.g. large accidental releases of softeners from laundry companies.</p> <p>For cationic surfactants:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Although cationic surfactants will sorb onto sludge particles and eventually reach the digester during the treatment of wastewater sludge, there is very limited information about the biodegradability of these compounds under anoxic conditions. It has been demonstrated, however, that the concentration of quaternary ammonium salts does not decrease, or only slightly decreases, in an anaerobic digester.\u00a0</p> <p>The numerous studies of aquatic toxicity, many of which were conducted in natural waters with and without added effluents, indicate that the source and composition of the test water dramatically affects the toxicity of the test substance. These results are consistent with the known behavior of these materials in the environment. Cationic substances in the environment instantaneously form complexes with naturally occurring negatively charged constituents in sewage, soils, sediments, and with dissolved humic substances in surface waters. This complexation behavior results in reduced bioavailability in actual environmental conditions that is not adequately represented by standard laboratory assays and/or predictions by various QSAR models.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Algae constitute a group of organisms which appears to be very sensitive to cationic surfactants.\u00a0</p> <p>Zwitterionic (amphoteric) substances, such as betaines, sulfobetaines  and taurines, may be phytotoxic. Because they are implicated in the  disruption of cell membranes,\u00a0 toxic effects on marine flora and fauna  (of a secondary nature) may ensue.<br />Surfactants show a complex  solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer concentration, and  hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting value at the  critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains approximately constant  as the total concentration is further increased. For ecotoxicological  models requiring a solubility value, the critical micelle concentration  is therefore the appropriate parameter describing water solubility of  surface active materials<br />Surfactants can form dispersions or  emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic toxicity studies is  difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution preparation. Micelle  formation can result in an overestimation of the bioavailable fraction  even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This presents significant  problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test results for surface  active materials. The so-called the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  is related to surface tension produced by the\u00a0 substance and is key  value for actual water solubility of the substance.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The primary biodegradability of betaines approaches 100% as, e.g., the loss of surface-activity attained 100% for C12 alkyl betaine, 98% for cocoamidopropyl betaine, and 96 and 100% for C14-15 hydroxysulfobetaine. The results from ultimate biodegradability tests of alkyl betaines show some variation with degradation percentages below and above the pass level for ready biodegradability. However, taken as a whole, \u00a0both alkyl betaines and cocoalkylamido betaines can be regarded as readily biodegradable. In contrast the hydroxysulfobetaines are probably not readily biodegradable in standard screening tests as indicated by a biodegradability of 40 and 47% of ThOD in the closed bottle test.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The knowledge about the biodegradability of betaines under anoxic conditions is relatively scarce. \u00a0Literature searches indicates that sulfate-reducing marine bacteria belonging to the genus\u00a0<i>Desulfobacterium</i>\u00a0are able to grow on betaine with the stoichiometric formation of\u00a0<i>N,N</i>-dimethylglycine. One study indicated that betaine was anaerobically degraded to methylamine in sewage sludge at a betaine concentration of 2 g/l and a solids concentration of 3.3 g/l. The anaerobic biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine was examine by using the ISO 11734 screening test. Under the methanogenic test conditions, the ultimate biodegradability of cocoamidopropyl betaine attained 45 and 75% of ThGP after 28 and 56 days, respectively, at the applied test concentration of 14.4 mg C/l\u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of betaines varies considerably, even within the same species, which is particularly evident by evaluating the EC50 values determined for the green alga\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus</i>. For this species, the EC50 obtained in tests with cocoamidopropyl betaine are between 0.55 and 48 mg/l. The geometric mean of the EC50 obtained for\u00a0<i>S. subspicatus\u00a0</i>is 3.1 mg/l, when the values 0.55, 1.84, and 30 mg/l are used . The EC/LC50 of alkyl and cocoamidopropyl betaines towards crustaceans and fish are between 1 and 100 mg/l.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",
                "EngineeringControls": "<p>Engineering controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.</p> <p>The basic types of engineering controls are:</p> <p>Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk.</p> <p>Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly.

Concentrated solutions of many cationics may cause corrosive damage to mucous membranes and the oesophagus. Nausea and vomiting (sometimes bloody) may follow ingestion. Serious exposures may produce an immediate burning sensation of the mouth, throat and abdomen with profuse salivation, ulceration of mucous membranes, signs of circulatory shock (hypotension, laboured breathing, and cyanosis) and a feeling of apprehension, restlessness, confusion and weakness. Weak convulsive movements may precede central nervous system depression. Erosion, ulceration, and petechial haemorrhage may occur through the small intestine with glottic, brain and pulmonary oedema. Death may result from asphyxiation due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration or cardiovascular collapse. Fatal poisoning may arise even when the only pathological signs are visceral congestion, swallowing, mild pulmonary oedema or varying signs of gastrointestinal irritation.

Therefore, read-across  of exposure-related observations in humans from CAS 683-10-3 is  justified. Data from several human closed patch tests demonstrate skin  irritation in humans ranging from mild to strong under occlusive  conditions even with concentrations as low as 1%. In contrast, exposure  to 0.1% under open conditions did not induce any positive skin  reactions. <br />Information on skin sensitisation in humans is available  from a closed human patch test with CAS 683-10-3. After an induction  period of 6 days with 0.1% of active ingredient, followed by a  treatment-free period of 10 days, the volunteers were challenged under  occlusive conditions for 24 hours. No reactions were observed  immediately after challenge; during the next 4 days only irritation  reactions were observed. <br />This finding was further supported by  industrial medical monitoring data.\u00a0 Workers involved in the production  of CAS 683-10-3 are routinely checked every 3 years for signs of skin  sensitisation, respiratory irritation, skin irritation and eye  irritation. During these examinations no signs of the aforementioned  disorders were observed which were related to the test substance. <br />Moreover,  a study focusing on dermal uptake of C12-alkyldimethyl betaine) into  human skin and the effects of surfactants on skin barrier function  demonstrated that only up to 0.4% of the applied dose was absorbed  within 30 minutes of exposure, with absorbance being dependent on the  concentration applied. Tape stripping of the skin revealed that the  administered test substance was primarily located in the outer stratum  corneum layer<br />Test material does not demonstrate mutagenic or clastogenic effects in bacteria or mammalian cells in vitro<br />\" REACH Dossier<br />Amphoteric  surfactants are easily absorbed in the intestine and are excreted  partly unchanged via the faeces. Metabolisation to CO2 and short-chained  fatty acids also occur. No tendency to accumulation in the organism or  storage of betaines in certain organs has been detected. Betaines  generally have a low acute toxicity. E.g., LD50 values for  cocoamidopropylbetaine (30% solution) by oral administration have been  determined to 4,910 mg/kg body weight in rats.<br />Betaines do not carry  any net charge, and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds  with proteins in the skin. This may be the explanation for the low  protein denaturation potential of betaines as the ion-binding of other  surfactants contributes to denaturation. In combination with anionic  surfactants a positive synergistic effect with regard to skin  compatibility is often found. Compared to a 20% solution of C12 alkyl  sulfate (AS; sodium lauryl sulfate) alone, decreased erythema was  observed for the combination of 20% C12 AS and 10% cocoamidopropyl  betaine one hour after the removal of patches. The combination of  cocoamidopropyl betaine and C12 AS also reduced swelling of the skin,  and generally interactions between amphoterics and AS produce less  swelling and result in milder skin reactions. Concentrated betaines are  expected to be irritant to skin and eyes. Diluted solutions (3-10%) are  not irritant to skin, but they are mildly irritant to the eyes (4.5%)<br />No  evidence of delayed contact hypersensitivity was found in guinea pigs  after topically administrated solutions of 10% cocoamidopropyl betaine  by using the Magnusson-Kligman maximization test. Various instances of  contact allergy to cocoamidopropyl betaine have been reported. In all of  the reports it was concluded that the observed skin reactions were due  to the presence of 3-dimethylaminopropylamine which is an impurity in  cocoamidopropyl betaine. This impurity is an intermediate in the  synthesis of alkylamidopropyldimethylamines that are intermediates in  the synthesis of the corresponding alkylamido betaines.<br />Cocoamidopropyl  betaine was proven to be non-mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the  Ames Salmonella/microsome reverse mutation assay. Short-term  genotoxicity tests have shown negative results of mutagenicity for  lauryl betaine in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",

Repeated inhalation may aggravate asthma and inflammatory or fibrotic pulmonary disease.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Results of repeated exposure tests with diethanolamine (DEA) in laboratory animals include anaemia (rats) and effects on the kidneys (rats and mice) and liver (mice). DEA produces nervous system injury in dogs and rats. Heart and salivary gland lesions have also been seen in mice treated cutaneously with DEA and in mice receiving DEA in drinking water. Rats given high doses of DEA developed anaemia and testicular lesions.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Exaggerated doses of DEA produced heart and nervous system effects in other animals. Changes in other organs were judged to be secondary due to the poor health of animals subjected to extremely high doses of DEA. Rats, rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to high vapour concentrations of volatile monoethanolamine (MEA) (up to 1250 ppm) for periods of up to 5 weeks developed pulmonary, hepatic and renal lesions. Dogs, rats and guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm MEA for 30 days, became apathetic and developed poor appetites. Animal tests also indicate that inhalation exposure to MEA may result in nervous system injury. All species exposed to airborne MEA experienced dermal effects, varying from ulceration to hair loss probably resulting from contact with the cage.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0An increased incidence of skeletal variations, suggestive of a slight developmental delay was seen in the foetuses of rats given 1500 mg/kg/day DEA cutaneously; this also produced significant maternal toxicity. No foetal malformations, however, were seen in rats nor in rabbits receiving identical treatment. The foetus of rats given high doses of MEA by gavage, showed an increased rate of embryofoetal death, growth retardation, and some malformations including hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The high doses required to produce these effects bring into question the relevance of this finding to humans. There is some evidence that embryofoetotoxicity and teratogenicity does not occur in rats when MEA is administered by dermal application to the mother.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of liver tumours and some evidence of kidney tumours in mice exposed dermally to DEA over their lifetime. Chronic skin painting studies in mice of both sexes produced liver tumours and an increased incidence of kidney tumours in male mice. The significance of these findings to humans is unclear as DEA is neither genotoxic, mutagenic nor clastogenic, and did not induce tumours in rats or transgenic mice similarly treated. Alkanolamines (especially those containing a secondary amine moiety) may react with nitrites or other nitrosating agents to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. Alkanolamines are metabolised by biosynthetic routes to ethanolamine and choline and incorporated into phospholipids. They are excreted predominantly unchanged with a half-life of approximately one week. In the absence of sodium nitrite, no conversion to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines was observed.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Diethanolamine competitively inhibits the cellular uptake of choline, in vitro, and hepatic changes in choline homeostasis, consistent with choline deficiency, are observed in vivo.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Many amines are potent skin and respiratory sensitisers and certain individuals especially those described as \"atopic\" (i.e. those predisposed to asthma and other allergic responses) may show allergic reactions when chronically exposed to alkanolamines.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0In a study with coconut diethanolamide, the National Toxicology Program (Technical Report Series 479), showed clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic and renal tubule neoplasms and in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatic neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tube neoplasms. These increases were associated with the concentration of free diethanolamine present as a contaminant in the diethanolamine condensate. Exposure to rats to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application in ethanol for 2 years resulted in epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis in males and females and ulcer in females at the site of application. There were increases in the incidences of chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial ulcer in the forestomach of female rats. The severity of nephropathy in dosed female rats were increased. Exposure of mice to coconut oil diethanolamine condensate by dermal application for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver in males. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis in males and females, ulcer in males, and parakeratosis and inflammation in females at the site of application and of follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland of males and females, were chemical related.</p>",

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Severe acute sodium hydroxide dust inhalation exposure may be fatal due to spasm, inflammation and oedema of the larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and severe pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Symptoms of overexposure include burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea and vomiting.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p>Direct contact with alkaline corrosives may produce pain and burns. Oedema, destruction of the epithelium, corneal opacification and iritis may occur. In less severe cases these symptoms tend to resolve. In severe injuries the full extent of the damage may not be immediately apparent with late complications comprising a persistent oedema, vascularisation and corneal scarring, permanent opacity, staphyloma, cataract, symblepharon and loss of sight.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce severe chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Sodium hydroxide burns are not immediately painful; onset of pain may be delayed minutes or hours; thus care should be taken to avoid contamination of gloves and boots.</p> <p>A 5% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide applied to the skin of rabbits for 4 hours produced severe necrosis. Instillation of a 1% solution into the conjunctival sac failed to produce ocular or conjunctival injury in rabbits provided the eye was promptly irrigated with copious amounts of water.</p> <p>Skin contact with alkaline corrosives may produce severe pain and burns; brownish stains may develop. The corroded area may be soft, gelatinous and necrotic; tissue destruction may be deep.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><b>NOTE:</b>\u00a0Prolonged contact is unlikely, given the severity of response, but repeated exposures may produce severe ulceration.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of sodium hydroxide may result in severe burns to the mouth, throat and stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the larynx and subsequent suffocation, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p> <p>A 1% aqueous solution (pH 13.4)of sodium hydroxide \u00a0failed to cause gastric, oesophageal or other damage in rabbits.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.

Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the vapour/dust mixture will be lower than the individual LELs for the vapors/mists or dusts. </li>\n<li>A dust explosion may release of large quantities of gaseous products; this in turn creates a subsequent pressure rise of explosive force capable of damaging plant and buildings and injuring people. </li>\n<li>Usually the initial or primary explosion takes place in a confined space such as plant or machinery, and can be of sufficient force to damage or rupture the plant. If the shock wave from the primary explosion enters the surrounding area, it will disturb any settled dust layers, forming a second dust cloud, and often initiate a much larger secondary explosion. All large scale explosions have resulted from chain reactions of this type. </li>\n<li>Dry dust can be charged electrostatically by turbulence, pneumatic transport, pouring, in exhaust ducts and during transport. </li>\n<li>Build-up of electrostatic charge may be prevented by bonding and grounding. </li>\n<li>Powder handling equipment such as dust collectors, dryers and mills may require additional protection measures such as explosion venting. </li>\n<li>All movable parts coming in contact with this material should have a speed of less than 1-meter/sec.\u00a0 </li>\n<li>A sudden release of statically charged materials from storage or process equipment, particularly at elevated temperatures and/ or pressure, may result in ignition especially in the absence of an apparent ignition source. </li>\n<li>One important effect of the particulate nature of powders is that the surface area and surface structure (and often moisture content) can vary widely from sample to sample, depending of how the powder was manufactured and handled; this means that it is virtually impossible to use flammability data published in the literature for dusts (in contrast to that published for gases and vapours). </li>\n<li>Autoignition temperatures are often quoted for dust clouds (minimum ignition temperature (MIT)) and dust layers (layer ignition temperature (LIT)); LIT generally falls as the thickness of the layer increases.</li>\n</ul> <p>Combustion products include:</p> <p>carbon monoxide (CO)</p> <p>carbon dioxide (CO2)</p> <p>sulfur oxides (SOx)</p> <p>metal oxides</p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000\">other pyrolysis products typical of burning organic material.</span></p> <p>May emit poisonous fumes.</p> <p>May emit corrosive fumes.</p>",

Within each subcategory the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter ion may also influence the physico-chemical behaviour of these chemicals, the chemical reactivity and classification for the purpose of this assessment is not expected to be affected by the difference in counter ion.</p> <p>As ionic substances, all members of this category have extremely low vapor pressures. Calculated values are in the ranges 10-11 to 10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkyl sulfates), 4.3.10-11 to 9.10-15 hPa (C8-18 alkane sulfonates), 2.1.10-13 to 6.9.10-15 hPa (C14-18 alkene sulfonates) and 3.3.10-17 to 5.8.10-19 hPa (C14-18 hydroxy alkane sulfonates). Therefore, they decompose before reaching their theoretical boiling points.</p> <p>Measured water solubilities are available only for alkyl sulfates; they are in the range 196 000 mg/l (C12) to 300 mg/l (C16) and by factors of 50 to 300 higher than calculated values (C12: 617 mg/l, C16: 5 mg/l).</p> <p>As surfactants have a tendency to concentrate at hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundaries rather than to equilibrate between phases log Kow is not a good descriptor of surfactant hydrophobicity and only of limited predictive value for the partitioning of these compounds in the environment.</p> <p>All calculated physico-chemical properties of surfactants should be treated with caution, because the estimation models do not take into account surfactant properties. In addition, the results are doubtful for ionic substances.</p> <p>Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties the target compartment for the substances of this category is the hydrosphere. Based on the ionic structure partitioning into the atmosphere can be excluded. In water, the compounds are stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions.</p> <p>Taking into account the low BCF factors (&lt;73) that were determined for (up to) C16-alkyl sulfates, any significant bioaccumulation is not expected.</p> <p>Soil sorption increases with chain length. Strong sorption on soils would be expected for chain length C14 upwards. Sediment concentrations were between 0.0035 and 0.021 mg/kg dw indicating that accumulation in sediments is low. Under certain conditions of reduced moisture in soil, i.e. in arid or semi-arid regions, accumulation in soil cannot be excluded.</p> <p>The substances of this category are readily biodegradable. Significant biodegradation of alkyl sulfates in the raw sewage, i.e. in the sewer system before reaching the (waste-water treatment plant (WWTPs) is very likely. The substances of this category are quantitatively removed in WWTPs, mainly by biodegradation. Because of the anaerobic degradation of alkyl sulfates in sewage sludge, exposure of agricultural soils due to application of sludge as fertiliser is not expected. However, for alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates this exposure pathway cannot be excluded due to their recalcitrant or limited anaerobic degradability.</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>The biological degradation of AS is initiated by a hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate ester bond catalysed by alkylsulfatases. The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde.

The cleavage leaves inorganic sulfate and fatty alcohol which undergo oxidation by dehydrogenases to produce fatty acids via fatty aldehydes. The fatty acids are degraded by beta-oxidation and finally totally mineralised or incorporated into biomass. The biodegradation pathway for secondary AS differs from that of the primary AS by the formation of a ketone instead of an aldehyde. Biodegradation under anoxic conditions is anticipated to follow the same pathway as for the aerobic degradation.</p> <p>Primary and secondary AS generally undergo complete primary biodegradation within a few days followed by a rapid ultimate biodegradation. Branched AS are also degraded quite rapidly, but multiple branchings of the alkyl chain considerably reduce the rate and extent of primary biodegradation. There are numerous studies confirming the aerobic biodegradability of AS, and linear primary AS exceeds all other anionic surfactants in the rate of primary and ultimate biodegradation. Also secondary AS are normally readily biodegradable as, e.g., the oxygen uptake from biodegradation of a linear secondary C10-13 AS corresponded to 77% ThOD in 22 days. Some highly branched AS being poorly primary biodegradable may also resist ultimate biodegradation.</p> <p>Both linear and 2-alkyl-branched primary AS are degraded to a high extent under anaerobic conditions.</p> <p>AS are generally considered to have a low potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms</p> <p><b>For alkane sulfonates:\u00a0</b>Alkane sulfonate anionics (SAS) undergo rapid primary biodegradation with Methylene Blue Active Substance (MBAS) removal higher than 90% within a few days. Removal of 96% were seen in the OECD screening test for primary biodegradation. In activated sludge simulation tests, 96% of C10-18 SAS was removed, while the parent C13-18 SAS was removed by 83-96%.</p> <p>Alkyl sulfonates are not degraded under anoxic conditions</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates:\u00a0</b>alpha-Olefine sulfonates (AOS) AOS undergo rapid primary biodegradability with methylene blue active substances ( MBAS) removal between 95 and 100% in 2 to 8 days in river water and inoculated media. The ultimate biodegradability of AOS exceeds the pass requirements in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability. \u00a0report 85% DOC removal in the modified OECD screening test, 85% ThOD in the closed bottle test, and 65-80% ThCO2 in the Sturm test. In activated sludge simulation tests, AOS was removed by 100% MBAS and 88% DOC. The alkene sulfonates and hydroxyalkane sulfonates in commercial AOS are both ultimately biodegraded as approximately 84% ThCO2 was obtained during degradation of C14, C16, and C18 within 27 days, whereas the corresponding 3-hydroxyalkane sulfonates were degraded by approximately 86% under the same conditions.</p> <p>AOS are not readily degradable under anaerobic conditions Reports indicate a range of 31% to 43% MBAS removal under anoxic conditions indicating primary biodegradation</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The aquatic toxicity is influenced by a number of parameters, the length of the alkyl chain being most important. The pH and temperature of water bodies can affect the EC/LC50 values for compounds that contain ammonium ions.</p> <p>The most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates were invertebrates, followed by fish. Algae proved to be less sensitive. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (NOEC = 0.045 mg/l).</p> <p><b>For alkyl sulfates:\u00a0</b>Fish LC50 (96 h): fathead minnow - fry 10.2 mg/l; juvenile 17 mg/l; adult 22.5 mg/l; rainbow trout 4.6 mg/l (static)</p> <p>The aquatic toxicity of AS seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length. This has been shown for daphnids and for some fish species. An overall comparison of the acute toxicity between the primary and secondary AS shows only minor differences in the toxicity, although only a few studies for comparison are available.</p> <p>The available data describing the toxicity of AS towards algae indicate that the lowest EC50 values range between 1 and 10 mg/l for C12 AS</p> <p>The toxicity of AS towards invertebrates has mainly been examined in tests with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity of AS to Daphnia magna increased with increasing alkyl chain length. It has been shown that during degradation of C12 AS, the toxicity first increased to a maximum after 30 hours and then fell to almost a negligible value. The increase in toxicity was explained by the formation of the more toxic dodecanoic acid which is rapidly transformed to other and less toxic metabolites.</p> <p>Studies showed that the 24 h-LC50 values for killifish in distilled water decreased by a factor of about 10 when the alkyl chain was increased by two carbon atoms. C16 was 10 times more toxic than C14, which was about 10 times more toxic than C12 AS.</p> <p>The toxicity of AS to fish has been demonstrated to increase with increasing alkyl chain length as also seen in studies with Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity on Daphnia magna has been determined for chain length C8-C14. Results were comparable to alkyl sulfates in the range between C8 and C10, while C12 and C14 are significantly less toxic. Chronic data obtained for C12 alkane sulfonate sodium and C12-alkyl sulfate sodium with the rotifer\u00a0<i>Brachionus calicyflorus</i>\u00a0similarly show that alkane sulfonates might be less toxic than alkyl sulfates. C16 and C18 alkane sulfonates are assumed to exhibit the same toxicity than alkyl sulfates of comparable chain lengths. No data are available concerning the toxicity of alkane sulfonates on fish and algae. However, a similar toxicity might be assumed because of structural and physico-chemical similarities between the three subcategories</p> <p>Whereas most correlations between AS structure and toxicity show an increasing toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length, the budding in Hydra attenuata was apparently more affected by C10 AS than by C12, C14, and C16 AS. The authors suggested that the decrease in toxicity with increasing alkyl chain length was attributable to reduced solubility in water</p> <p>Tests on the toxicity to microorganisms were only conducted with alkyl sulfates as test substances. A test on the inhibition of respiration of activated sludge resulted in an 3 h-EC50 of 135 mg/l (nominally). The lowest effect value for protozoa was obtained from a test on\u00a0<i>Uronema parduczi</i>\u00a0using C12-alkyl sulfate sodium - \u00a0the 20 h-EC5 was 0.75 mg/l.</p> <p>Experimental test results on benthic organisms in a water-sediment system are not available. However, due to sediment-water partitioning coefficients Kd &lt; 350, no significant risk for organisms in this compartment is to be expected.</p> <p>Data indicate that toxic effects on soil organisms might only be expected at high concentrations for alkyl sulfates. Toxicity of alkane sulfonates and alpha-olefin sulfonates can not be assessed because test results for terrestrial organisms are not available.</p> <p><b>For alpha-olefin sulfonates,</b>\u00a0reliable short-term tests on fish, invertebrates and algae are available. The results indicate that toxicity is increasing as the alkyl chain length increases. The lowest available effect value is the 96 h-LC50 = 0.5 mg/l, determined in tests on\u00a0<i>Oryzias latipes, Rasbora heteromorpha</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Salmo trutta</i></p> <p>Algae show toxic effects to growth when exposed 10-100 mg/l for C14-18 AOS.</p> <p>EC50 values for\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna</i>\u00a0have been determined within the range 5-50 mg/l for C14-18 AOS .

On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit.

This discolouration may have resulted from interaction with skin sebum.|Under the conditions of a 2-year dermal study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium xylene sulfonate in male and female rats administered up to 240 mg/kg or in male or female mice administered up to 727 mg/kg. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia in female and male mice may be related to exposure to sodium xylene sulfonate. These lesions were typically minimal to mild in severity.|National Toxicology Program Technical Report Series No. 464, June 1998",
