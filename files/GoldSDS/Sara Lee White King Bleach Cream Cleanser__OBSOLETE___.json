On the environmental fate side, this includes standard biodegradation studies, advanced simulation studies of removal in treatment systems, and field monitoring data. On the environmental effects side, acute as well as chronic single-species data are available, as well as advanced studies in micro- and mesocosm systems.</p> <p>By means of these higher tier exposure and effects data, it could be shown that the use of AES in household detergents and cleaning products results in risk characterization ratios less than one, indicating no concern, for all environmental compartments.</p> <p>The most frequent initial step in the biodegradation of AES is the cleavage of an ether bond.. The cleavage may take place at any ether bond producing a fatty alcohol or an alcohol ethoxylate and ethylene glycol sulfates of various lengths.. The length of the alkyl chain and the number of EO units apparently do not affect the degree of aerobic biodegradation, but branching of the alkyl chain may hinder the primary biodegradation of AES. AES are degraded readily and completely under aerobic conditions. E.g., for C12-14 AE3S, a rapid primary degradation of 90-100% is reported to take place within a period of 1 to 5 days. In activated sludge simulation tests 67-99% DOC was removed by degradation of C12-14 AE2S and C12-15 AE3S. The ultimate biodegradation of AES has been confirmed in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability.</p> <p>Based on at least one study, AES are not considered to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The chemical structure of AES highly influences the effect on aquatic organisms. The relations between alkyl chain length, number of EO groups and toxicity are complex and not yet resolved, but in general, changes in EO numbers affects toxicity more than changes in the alkyl chain length. In AES with alkyl chains of less than C16, the toxicity tended to decrease with increasing numbers of EO, but this was reversed for alkyl chain lengths above C16. The toxicity of AES thus seems to peak at alkyl chain lengths of C16. In a study of the acute toxicity of various AES (C8 to C19.6 and 1-3 EO) to bluegill sunfish (<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>), the LC50 fell from &gt; 250 mg/l for C8 and 375 mg/l for C10 to 24 mg/l for C13, 4-7 mg/l for C14, 2 mg/l for C15 and 0.3 mg/l for C16, and then increased to 10.8 mg/l for C17.9 and 17 mg/l for C19.6. Reported ranges for EC50 for the acute toxicity of AES to daphnids between 1 and 50 mg/l. However, an EC50 of 0.37 mg/l was observed in a 21-day reproduction test with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna.\u00a0</i>The LC50 values for fish are in the range between 0.39 to 450 mg/l. A LOEC value of 0.22 mg/l has been reported for a chronic life cycle test with a duration of 1 year. The toxicity of AES towards fish seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length for AES with up to 16 carbons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood - local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. \u00a0Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). \u00a0Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. \u00a0The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. \u00a0Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

They can be\r\nused to build viscosity and boost foam over a broad pH range.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are surfactants\r\ncommonly used in consumer products such as shampoos, conditioners, detergents,\r\nand hard surface cleaners. Alkyl dimethyl amine oxide (chain lengths C10-C16)\r\nis the most commercially used amine oxide.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are used as\r\nprotecting group for amines and as chemical intermediates. Long-chain alkyl\r\namine oxides are used as amphoteric surfactants and foam stabilizers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are weak bases with\r\na pKb of around 4.5 that form R3N+-OH, cationic hydroxylamines, upon\r\nprotonation at a pH below their pKb. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are highly polar\r\nmolecules and have a polarity close to that of quaternary ammonium salts. Small\r\namine oxides are very hydrophilic and have an excellent water solubility and a\r\nvery poor solubility in most organic solvents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides, known as N-oxides\r\nof tertiary amines, are classified as aromatic or aliphatic, depending on\r\nwhether the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring system or not. This structural\r\ndifference accounts for the difference in chemical and physical properties\r\nbetween the two types. The higher aliphatic amine oxides are commercially\r\nimportant because of their surfactant properties and are used extensively in\r\ndetergents. Amine oxides that have surface-acting properties can be further\r\ncategorised as nonionic surfactants; however, because under acidic conditions\r\nthey show cationic properties, they have also been called cationic surfactants.\r\nMost amine oxides undergo thermal decomposition between 90 and 200\u00b0C. Aromatic\r\namine oxides, have some pharmaceutical importance, do not demonstrate\r\nsurface-acting properties and are more resistant than aliphatic amine oxides to\r\nreduction. Linear alpha-olefins are the source of the largest volume of\r\naliphatic amine oxides. Fatty alcohols and fatty acids are also used to produce\r\namine oxides. Amine oxides used in industry are prepared by oxidation of\r\ntertiary amines with hydrogen peroxide solution. Amine oxides are used in the\r\ndetergent, organic synthesis, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. Aliphatic\r\namine oxides range from practically nontoxic to slightly toxic. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxide based surfactants are\r\nantimicrobial being effective against common bacteria such as S. aureus and E.\r\ncoli. They are also non-denaturing and may be used to solubilise proteins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are common\r\nmetabolites of medication and psychoactive drugs. Examples include nicotine,\r\nZolmitriptan, and morphine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides of anti-cancer drugs\r\nhave been developed as prodrugs that are metabolized in the oxygen-deficient\r\ncancer tissue to the active drug</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>",

Experimental values for\r\nmelting points of C10 to C16 amine oxides range from 125 to 136 C. Amine oxides\r\nundergo Cope elimination, i.e., the formation of an olefin and a hydroxylamine\r\nby pyrolysis of an amine oxide, in the temperature range 150-200 C, thus\r\ndecomposition is likely to occur before the melting point is reached, and all\r\nboiling points are predicted to be far above the decomposition temperature.\r\nAmine oxides are not volatile: predicted vapor pressure values are &lt; 4.6E-7\r\nhPa. Amine oxides are highly water soluble - measured values for a C12.6\r\naverage chain length is ~410 g/L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although it is impossible to accurately measure an octanol-water\r\npartition coefficient for surface-active agents like amine oxides, an\r\noctanol-water partition coefficient (Log value) of &lt; 2.7 has been calculated\r\nfor amine oxides of chain length C14 and below. The predicted atmospheric\r\noxidation half lives are of the order of 5 hours, indicating a relatively rapid\r\natmospheric degradation potential.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Amine oxides are removed by conventional sewage treatment systems\r\nand biodegrade under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Of the collected data,\r\nfour amine oxides meet the \u201creadily biodegradable\u201d OECD criterion, two are\r\n\u201cultimately biodegradable,\u201d and two are \u201cinherently biodegradable.\u201d These\r\nstudies are conducted on complex mixtures with a high degree of alkyl chain\r\nlength overlap. Further, biodegradation is not dependent on chain length.\r\nRemoval of amine oxides in biological wastewater treatment has been studied in\r\nlaboratory simulation studies (&gt;99.8% removal, OECD 303A study) as well as\r\nthrough monitoring activities in different geographies; the main removal\r\nmechanism can be attributed to mineralisation and an average removal number of\r\n98% can be assumed as applicable for secondary activated sludge treatment.\r\nLevel III fugacity modeling, using loading rates for air, soil, and water of\r\n1000 kg/h for each media, shows water receiving compartment receiving 99.5%;\r\nthe other compartments are negligible. The bioconcentration factor for amine\r\noxides &lt;C14, is predicted to be &lt;87, based on log Kow data, indicating low\r\npotential for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Based on hazard data, freshwater green algae are considered the\r\nmost sensitive species, for acute and chronic endpoints. Acute toxicity is\r\naffected by chain length for fish and invertebrates. Chain length affects\r\nhydrophobicity, wherein longer chain-lengths increase the rate of uptake and\r\ndecrease depuration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The range of acute LC50/EC50/ErC50 values based on a review of the\r\naquatic toxicity data on AO were 0.60-32 mg/L for fish, 0.50-10.8 mg/L\r\nfor\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna\u00a0</i>and 0.010-5.30 mg/L for algae. Chronic\r\ntoxicity data were normalised to a chain length of 12.9 carbon atoms, as this\r\naverage chain length represents the largest volume product for North America\r\n(CAS No 70952-80-2). Chronic toxicity (NOEC, EC20) for an amine oxide of\r\naverage chain length of C12.9 ranged as follows for the different trophic\r\nlevels: 0.010-1.72 mg/L for algae, 0.28 mg/L for Daphnia (flow through) and\r\n0.31 mg/L for fish (flow through). These are based on geometric mean values,\r\nand a dataset of 21 chronic toxicity studies. Based on a chronic periphyton\r\nmicrocosm bioassay that included 110 taxa of algae (most sensitive species), a\r\nNOEC value of 0.050 mg/L was derived when normalized for a C12.9 amine oxide.</span></p> <p>For surfactants:<br /><strong>Environmental fate:</strong><br />Octanol/water  partition coefficients cannot easily be determined for surfactants  because one part of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other part is  hydrophobic. Consequently they tend to accumulate at the interface and  are not extracted into one or other of the liquid phases. As a result  surfactants are expected to transfer slowly, for example, from water  into the flesh of fish. During this process, readily biodegradable  surfactants are expected to be metabolised rapidly during the process of  bioaccumulation. This was emphasised by the OECD Expert Group stating  that chemicals are not to be considered to show bioaccumulation  potential if they are readily biodegradable.<br />Surfactants show a  complex solubility behaviour due to aggregation. The monomer  concentration, and hence the thermodynamic activity, reaches a limiting  value at the critical micelle concentration (CMC). It remains  approximately constant as the total concentration is further increased.  For ecotoxicological models requiring a solubility value, the critical  micelle concentration is therefore the appropriate parameter describing  water solubility of surface active materials.<br />Surfactants can form  dispersions or emulsions in which the bioavailablity for aquatic  toxicity studies is difficult to ascertain, even with careful solution  preparation. Micelle formation can result in an overestimation of the  bioavailable fraction even when \u201csolutions\u201d are apparently formed. This  presents significant problems of interpretation of aquatic toxicity test  results for surface active materials. The so-called the critical  micelle concentration (CMC) is is related to surface tension produced by  the\u00a0 substance and is the key value for actual water solubility of the  substance .<br />Several anionic and nonionic surfactants have been  investigated to evaluate their potential to bioconcentrate in fish. BCF  values (BCF - bioconcentration factor) ranging from 1 to 350 were found.  These are absolute maximum values, resulting from the radiolabelling  technique used. In all these studies, substantial oxidative metabolism  was found resulting in the highest radioactivity in the gall bladder.  This indicates liver transformation of the parent compound and biliary  excretion of the metabolised compounds, so that \"real\" bioconcentration  is overstated. After correction it can be expected that \"real\" parent  BCF values are one order of magnitude less than those indicated above,  i.e. \"real\" BCF is &lt;100. Therefore the usual data used for  classification by EU directives to determine whether a substance is  \"Dangerous to the \"Environment\" has little bearing on whether the use of  the surfactant is environmentally acceptable.<br /><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong><br />Surfactant  should be considered to be toxic (EC50 and LC50 values of &lt; 10 mg/L)  to aquatic species under conditions that allow contact of the chemicals  with the organisms. The water solubility of the chemicals does not  impact the toxicity except as it relates to the ability to conduct tests  appropriately to obtain exposure of the test species. The acute aquatic  toxicity generally is considered to be related to the effects of the  surfactant properties on the organism and not to direct chemical  toxicity.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

These effects are thought to be transient and are probably related to the pharmacodynamic action of the amines. Histamine release by aliphatic amines may produce bronchoconstriction and wheezing.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns to the eye following direct contact. Vapours or mists may be extremely irritating.</p> <p>When applied to the eye(s) of animals, the material produces severe ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Some nonionic surfactants may produce a localised anaesthetic effect on the cornea; this may effectively eliminate the warning discomfort produced by other substances and lead to corneal injury. Irritant effects range from minimal to severe dependent on the nature of the surfactant, its concentration and the duration of contact. Pain and corneal damage represent the most severe manifestation of irritation.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns following direct contact with the skin.</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>One of the mechanisms of skin irritation caused by surfactants is considered to be denaturation of the proteins of skin. It has also been established that there is a connection between the potential of surfactants to denature protein in vitro and their effect on the skin. Nonionic surfactants do not carry any net charge and, therefore, they can only form hydrophobic bonds with proteins. For this reason, proteins are not deactivated by nonionic surfactants, and proteins with poor solubility are not solubilized by nonionic surfactants</p> <p>Volatile amine vapours produce primary skin irritation and dermatitis. Direct local contact, with the lower molecular weight liquids, may produce skin burns. Percutaneous absorption of simple aliphatic amines is known to produce lethal effects often the same as that for oral administration. Cutaneous sensitisation has been recorded chiefly due to ethyleneamines. Histamine release following exposure to many aliphatic amines may result in \"triple response\" (white vasoconstriction, red flare and wheal) in human skin.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The material produces mild skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material can produce chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Nonionic surfactants may produce localised irritation of the oral or gastrointestinal mucosa and induce vomiting and mild diarrhoea.</p> <p>Aliphatic and alicyclic amines are generally well absorbed from the gut. Corrosive action may cause tissue damage throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Detoxification is thought to occur in the liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa with the enzymes, monoamine oxidase and diamine oxidase (histaminase) having a significant role.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause degreasing with drying, cracking and dermatitis following.</p>",

Therefore the concentration of chlorine in an aqueous solution is generally expressed as free available chlorine (FAC) which is the sum of Cl2 + HOCl + ClO-, regardless whether these species stem from dissolved gaseous chlorine or from dissolved sodium/calcium hypochlorite</p> <p>Hypochlorite anion dissolved in water is brought to equilibrium between active chlorine species like chlorine (Cl2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or hypochlorite ClO-. The relative amounts of the components are dependent on ionic strength and pH. At the pH in the natural environment (6-8), HOCl or ClO is dominating (HClO: pKa = 7.53). A diluted aqueous solution of HOCl will decompose very slowly in the dark, but more rapidly in the presence of light, particularly rapidly in full sun light, by producing hydrogen chloride and oxygen. Some chlorine and chloric acid (HClO3) may also develop. The physico-chemical properties indicate that chlorine released into the environment as HClO or Cl2 is distributed into water and air. Consequently, the effects that may manifest in the natural environment are considered common to those assessed for the other source of hypochlorite.</p> <p>In the natural water, in the presence of organic or inorganic compounds, the free available chlorine immediately reacts forming various chlorinated and/or oxidized by-products e.g. chloramines or chloromethanes. They are mainly distributed to the hydrosphere, but are also able to transfer to some extent to the atmosphere depending on their intrinsic properties. A potential for bioaccumulation or bioconcentration of active chlorine species can be disregarded, because of their water solubility and their high reactivity.</p> <p>In fresh water, the hypochlorites break down rapidly into non-toxic compounds when exposed to sunlight. In seawater, chlorine levels decline rapidly; however, hypobromite (which is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms) is formed. Sodium and calcium hypochlorite are low in toxicity to avian wildlife, but they are highly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates.</p> <p>Hypochlorite is a highly reactive chemical which, during and after its use in household scenarios, undergoes a variety of reactions. The major one is the oxidation of inorganic and organic species.</p> <p>A minor reaction, which consumes about 1.5% of the chlorine atoms from hypochlorite, is chlorination, which leads to formation of organohalogen by-products that are often measured by the group parameter, AOX.</p> <p>Hypochlorite itself is rapidly broken down during use, in the sewer, and if any does reach sewage treatment it will further degrade (half-life of around 0.6 minutes). Predictions have indicated that its concentration will fall to below 1.E-32 ug/l by the end of the sewer, partially due to its reaction with ammonia in the sewer which leads to a subsequent increase in chloramine.</p> <p>The organohalogen by-products formed from the use of hypochlorite are currently receiving much attention. However, the levels of AOX produced are low (for example, 37 ug/l from bleach use compared to a sewage background level of 106 ug/l), and the organohalogens produced from domestic use of hypochlorite are not believed to have an adverse effect on the environment. Available data indicate that no dioxins are produced, and that the identified AOXs are typically small molecules with a low degree of chlorination and for which ecotoxicological properties are known or can be predicted. Where drinking water is disinfected by chlorination, the levels of organohalogens in sewage effluent arising from bleach use will be comparable with, and sometimes only a fraction of, those arising from the tap-water. After secondary sewage treatment, the levels entering receiving waters will be of the same order of magnitude as background levels typically present in rivers, though the total flux in rivers from natural sources will be much greater.</p> <p>The majority of the measured AOX is unidentified, but thought to consist of high molecular weight components formed from fats, proteins and humic acids which are too large to bioaccumulate.</p> <p>In addition, studies on the whole AOX mixture in laundry waste-water indicated that the level of AOX present did not effect growth or reproduction of\u00a0<i>Ceriodaphnia</i>, and that around 70% is removed in activated sludge.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The level of chloramine reaching surface water is estimated to be below 5.E-10 ug/l. Both these concentrations are orders of magnitude below the lowest acute EC50s determined for sodium hypochlorite (EC50 to invertebrates = 5 ug/l) and monochloramine (EC50 to invertebrates = 16 ug/l).</p> <p>Valid freshwater short-term toxicity data are available only for invertebrates: the LC50 for Ceriodaphnia dubia is 5 ug FAC/l (FAC=Free available chlorine). Adequate standard acute tests in fish are not available, but from many reliable studies performed under intermittent exposure conditions a 96h LC50 of 60 ug TRC/L and a 168 h LC50 of 330 ug TRC/L can be derived (TRC = total residual chlorine = the sum of combined and free residual available chlorine). Due to the intermittent regime (three 45 minutes pulses per day) a 96h LC50 &lt;&lt; 60 ug TRC/l can be expected for fish in a standard test. Most lowest result for algae is reported for Thalassiosira pseudonana with a IC50 of 75 ug/L (20 deg C).</p> <p>Regarding long-term toxicity to freshwater organisms, the lowest NOEC was 5 ug/L (Ictalurus punctatus, 133 d, growth). In microcosm and field studies the most sensitive parameter was the density of zooplankton with a NOEC of 1.5 ug TRC/L, and zooplankton is more sensitive to chlorine than algae.</p> <p>For salt water, valid short-term toxicity data are available for mollusks and for fish (Oncorhynchus kisutch 96 h LC50 = 32 ug TRO/L) (TRO = Total Residual Oxidant) showing comparable sensitivity. For long term toxicity the molluscs are more sensitive than fish showing a 15 d NOEC of 6.2 ug TRO/L. It is impossible to delineate representative toxicity indicator figures because of the unique feature of the chemical to be tested in standard methods. However, the accumulated scientific information covering a wide range of species, temperature,application regime or field studies can be used for the hazard assessment.</p> <p>Prevent, by any means available, spillage from entering drains or water courses.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>The material can produce severe chemical burns within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of hypochlorites may cause burning in the mouth and throat, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain and inflammation of the mouth and stomach, fall of blood pressure, shock, confusion, \u00a0and delirium. Severe poisonings may lead to convulsion, coma and death. Ingestion irritates the mouth, throat, and stomach. The hypochlorous acid liberated in the stomach can cause wall perforation, toxemia, haemorrhage and death.</p> <p>Necrosis and haemorrhage of the upper digestive tract, oedema and pulmonary emphysema were found on autopsy after suicidal ingestion, and methaemoglobinaemia was also reported in another fatal case</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to corrosives may result in the erosion of teeth, inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the mouth and necrosis (rarely) of the jaw. Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There exists limited evidence that shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals, and/or of producing positive response in experimental animals.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Reduced respiratory capacity may result from chronic low level exposure to chlorine gas. Chronic poisoning may result in coughing, severe chest pains, sore throat and haemoptysis (bloody sputum). Moderate to severe exposures over 3 years produced decreased lung capacity in a number of workers.</p> <p>Delayed effects can include shortness of breath, violent headaches, pulmonary oedema and pneumonia.\u00a0</p> <p>Amongst chloralkali workers exposed to mean concentrations of 0.15 ppm for an average of 10.9 years a generalised pattern of fatigue (exposures of 0.5 ppm and above) and a modest increased incidence of anxiety and dizziness were recorded. Leukocytosis and a lower haematocrit showed some relation to exposure.</p>",

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of alkaline corrosives may produce irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing, choking, pain and mucous membrane damage. Pulmonary oedema may develop in more severe cases; this may be immediate or in most cases following a latent period of 5-72 hours. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, dyspnoea, frothy sputum, cyanosis and dizziness. Findings may include hypotension, a weak and rapid pulse and moist rales.</p> <p>Severe acute sodium hydroxide dust inhalation exposure may be fatal due to spasm, inflammation and oedema of the larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis and severe pulmonary oedema.</p> <p>Symptoms of overexposure include burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea and vomiting.</p> <p>Persons with impaired respiratory function, airway diseases and conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, may incur further disability if excessive concentrations of particulate are inhaled.</p> <p>If prior damage to the circulatory or nervous systems has occurred or if kidney damage has been sustained, proper screenings should be conducted on individuals who may be exposed to further risk if handling and use of the material result</p> <p>in excessive exposures.</p> <p><br /></p>",

The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Ingestion of alkaline corrosives may produce immediate pain, and circumoral burns. Mucous membrane corrosive damage is characterised by a white appearance and soapy feel; this may then become brown, oedematous and ulcerated. Profuse salivation with an inability to swallow or speak may also result. Even where there is limited or no evidence of chemical burns, both the oesophagus and stomach may experience a burning pain; vomiting and diarrhoea may follow. The vomitus may be thick and may be slimy (mucous) and may eventually contain blood and shreds of mucosa. Epiglottal oedema may result in respiratory distress and asphyxia. Marked hypotension is symptomatic of shock; a weak and rapid pulse, shallow respiration and clammy skin may also be evident. Circulatory collapse may occur and, if uncorrected, may produce renal failure. Severe exposures may result in oesophageal or gastric perforation accompanied by mediastinitis, substernal pain, peritonitis, abdominal rigidity and fever. Although oesophageal, gastric or pyloric stricture may be evident initially, these may occur after weeks or even months and years. Death may be quick and results from asphyxia, circulatory collapse or aspiration of even minute amounts. Death may also be delayed as a result of perforation, pneumonia or the</p> <p>effects of stricture formation.</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of sodium hydroxide may result in severe burns to the mouth, throat and stomach, pain, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the larynx and subsequent suffocation, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p> <p>A 1% aqueous solution (pH 13.4)of sodium hydroxide \u00a0failed to cause gastric, oesophageal or other damage in rabbits.</p>",

Bronchial irritation, with cough, and frequent attacks of bronchial pneumonia may ensue. Gastrointestinal disturbances may also occur. Chronic exposures may result in dermatitis and/or conjunctivitis.</p> <p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung.
