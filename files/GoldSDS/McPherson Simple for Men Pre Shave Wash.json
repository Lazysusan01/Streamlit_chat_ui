On the environmental fate side, this includes standard biodegradation studies, advanced simulation studies of removal in treatment systems, and field monitoring data. On the environmental effects side, acute as well as chronic single-species data are available, as well as advanced studies in micro- and mesocosm systems.</p> <p>By means of these higher tier exposure and effects data, it could be shown that the use of AES in household detergents and cleaning products results in risk characterization ratios less than one, indicating no concern, for all environmental compartments.</p> <p>The most frequent initial step in the biodegradation of AES is the cleavage of an ether bond.. The cleavage may take place at any ether bond producing a fatty alcohol or an alcohol ethoxylate and ethylene glycol sulfates of various lengths.. The length of the alkyl chain and the number of EO units apparently do not affect the degree of aerobic biodegradation, but branching of the alkyl chain may hinder the primary biodegradation of AES. AES are degraded readily and completely under aerobic conditions. E.g., for C12-14 AE3S, a rapid primary degradation of 90-100% is reported to take place within a period of 1 to 5 days. In activated sludge simulation tests 67-99% DOC was removed by degradation of C12-14 AE2S and C12-15 AE3S. The ultimate biodegradation of AES has been confirmed in OECD 301 tests for ready biodegradability.</p> <p>Based on at least one study, AES are not considered to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>The chemical structure of AES highly influences the effect on aquatic organisms. The relations between alkyl chain length, number of EO groups and toxicity are complex and not yet resolved, but in general, changes in EO numbers affects toxicity more than changes in the alkyl chain length. In AES with alkyl chains of less than C16, the toxicity tended to decrease with increasing numbers of EO, but this was reversed for alkyl chain lengths above C16. The toxicity of AES thus seems to peak at alkyl chain lengths of C16. In a study of the acute toxicity of various AES (C8 to C19.6 and 1-3 EO) to bluegill sunfish (<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>), the LC50 fell from &gt; 250 mg/l for C8 and 375 mg/l for C10 to 24 mg/l for C13, 4-7 mg/l for C14, 2 mg/l for C15 and 0.3 mg/l for C16, and then increased to 10.8 mg/l for C17.9 and 17 mg/l for C19.6. Reported ranges for EC50 for the acute toxicity of AES to daphnids between 1 and 50 mg/l. However, an EC50 of 0.37 mg/l was observed in a 21-day reproduction test with\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna.\u00a0</i>The LC50 values for fish are in the range between 0.39 to 450 mg/l. A LOEC value of 0.22 mg/l has been reported for a chronic life cycle test with a duration of 1 year. The toxicity of AES towards fish seems to increase with increasing alkyl chain length for AES with up to 16 carbons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products, Environment Project, 615, 2001.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.</p> <p>Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>General exhaust is adequate under normal operating conditions. If risk of overexposure exists, wear SAA approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Provide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage areas. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s (100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>grinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).</p>  </td> <td> <p>2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood - local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. \u00a0Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). \u00a0Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. \u00a0The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. \u00a0Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
