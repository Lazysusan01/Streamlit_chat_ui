In unsaturated topsoil containing organic material, it has been estimated that 97% of the toluene is adsorbed to the soil and only about 2% is in the soil-water phase and transported with flowing groundwater. There is little retardation in sandy soils and 2-13% of the toluene was estimated to migrate with flowing water; the remainder was volatilised, biodegraded, or unaccounted for. In saturated deep soils with no soil-air phase, about 48% may be transported with flowing groundwater.</p> <p><b>Transformation/Persistence:</b></p> <p><b>Air\u00a0</b>- The main degradation pathway for toluene in the atmosphere is reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The estimated atmospheric half life for toluene is about 13 hours. Toluene is also oxidised by reactions with atmospheric nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and ozone, but these are minor degradation pathways. Photolysis is not considered a significant degradative pathway for toluene\u00a0</p> <p><b>Soil\u00a0</b>- In surface soil, volatilisation to air is an important fate process for toluene. Biodegradation of toluene has been demonstrated in the laboratory to occur with a half life of about 1 hour. In the environment, biodegradation of toluene to carbon dioxide occurs with a typical half life of 1-7 days.</p> <p><b>Water\u00a0</b>- An important fate process for toluene is volatilization, the rate of which depends on the amount of turbulence in the surface water .The volatilisation of toluene from static water has a half life of 1-16 days, whereas from turbulent water the half life is 5-6 hours. Degradation of toluene in surface water occurs primarily by biodegradation with a half life of less than one day under favorable conditions (presence of microorganisms, microbial adaptation, and optimum temperature). Biodegradation also occurs in shallow groundwater and in salt water at a reduced rate). No data are available on anaerobic degradation of toluene in deep ground water conditions where aerobic degradation would be minimal .</p> <p><b>Biota\u00a0</b>- Bioaccumulation in most organisms is limited by the metabolism of toluene into more polar compounds that have greater water solubility and a lower affinity for lipids.

Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Based on such findings the estimated risk of leukaemia in workers exposed at daily benzene concentrations of 10 ppm for 40 years is 155 times that of unexposed workers; at 1 ppm the risk falls to 1.7 times whilst at 0.1 ppm the risk is about the same in the two groups.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression.

Ataxia, incoordination and tremors of the hands and feet (as a consequence of diffuse cerebral atrophy), headache, abnormal speech, transient memory loss, convulsions, coma, drowsiness, reduced colour perception, frank blindness, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye-movements), hearing loss leading to deafness and mild dementia have all been associated with chronic abuse. Peripheral nerve damage, encephalopathy, giant axonopathy electrolyte disturbances in the cerebrospinal fluid and abnormal computer tomographic (CT scans) are common amongst toluene addicts. Although toluene abuse has been linked with kidney disease, this does not commonly appear in cases of occupational toluene exposures. Cardiac and haematological toxicity are however associated with chronic toluene exposures. Cardiac arrhythmia, multifocal and premature ventricular contractions and supraventricular tachycardia are present in 20% of patients who abused toluene-containing paints. Previous suggestions that chronic toluene inhalation produced human peripheral neuropathy have been discounted. However central nervous system (CNS) depression is well documented where blood toluene exceeds 2.2 mg%. Toluene abusers can achieve transient circulating concentrations of 6.5 %. Amongst workers exposed for a median time of 29 years, to toluene, no subacute effects on neurasthenic complaints and psychometric test results could be established.\u00a0</p> <p>The prenatal toxicity of very high toluene concentrations has been documented for several animal species and man. Malformations indicative of specific teratogenicity have not generally been found. Neonatal toxicity, described in the literature, takes the form of embryo death or delayed foetal growth and delayed skeletal system development. Permanent damage of children has been seen only when mothers have suffered from chronic intoxication as a result of \"sniffing\".</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Chronic inhalation or skin exposure to n-hexane may cause peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to nerve ends in extremities, e.g. fingers, with loss of sensation and characteristic thickening. Nerve damage has been documented with chronic exposures of greater than 500 ppm. Improvement in condition does not immediately follow removal from exposure and symptoms may progress for two or three months. Recovery may take a year or more depending on severity of exposure, and may not always be complete. Exposure to n-hexane with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) will accelerate the appearance of damage, but MEK alone will not cause the nerve damage. Other isomers of hexane do not cause nerve damage.

Benzene is a myelotoxicant known to suppress bone- marrow cell proliferation and to induce haematologic disorders in humans and animals. Signs of benzene-induced aplastic anaemia include suppression of leukocytes (leukopenia), red cells (anaemia), platelets (thrombocytopenia) or all three cell types (pancytopenia). Classic symptoms include weakness, purpura, and haemorrhage. The most significant toxic effect is insidious and often reversible injury to the blood forming tissue. Leukaemia may develop. Occupational exposures have shown a relationship between exposure to benzene and production of myelogenous leukaemia. There may also be a relationship between benzene exposure and the production of lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In chronic exposure, workers exhibit signs of central nervous system lesions and impairment of hearing.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Benzene haemotoxicity and leukaemogenicity involve metabolism, growth factor regulation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell regulation, and apoptosis.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness.

Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures).

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.
