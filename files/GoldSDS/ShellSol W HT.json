Determining the chemical composition of a petroleum release is further complicated by hydrodynamic, abiotic, and biotic processes that act on the release to change the chemical character.</p> <p>The longer the release is exposed to the environment, the greater the change in chemical character and the harder it is to obtain accurate analytical results reflecting the identity of the release. After extensive weathering, detailed knowledge of the original bulk product is often less valuable than current site-specific information on a more focused set of hydrocarbon components. Health assessment efforts are frequently frustrated by three primary problems: (1) the inability to identify and quantify the individual compounds released to the environment as a consequence of a petroleum spill; (2) the lack of information characterizing the fate of the individual compounds in petroleum mixtures; and (3) the lack of specific health guidance values for the majority of chemicals present in petroleum products. To define the public health implications associated with exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of petroleum properties, compositions, and the physical, chemical, biological, and toxicological properties of the compounds most often identified as the key chemicals of concern.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Petroleum products released to the environment migrate through soil via two general pathways: (1) as bulk oil flow infiltrating the soil under the forces of gravity and capillary action, and (2) as individual compounds separating from the bulk petroleum mixture and dissolving in air or water. When bulk oil flow occurs, it results in little or no separation of the individual compounds from the product mixture and the infiltration rate is usually fast relative to the dissolution rate. Many compounds that are insoluble and immobile in water are soluble in bulk oil and will migrate along with the bulk oil flow. Factors affecting the rate of bulk oil infiltration include soil moisture content, vegetation, terrain, climate, rate of release (e.g., catastrophic versus slow leakage), soil particle size (e.g., sand versus clay), and oil viscosity (e.g., gasoline versus motor oil).</p> <p>As bulk oil migrates through the soil column, a small amount of the product mass is retained by soil particles. The bulk product retained by the soil particles is known as \"residual saturation\".</p> <p>Depending upon the persistence of the bulk oil, residual saturation can potentially reside in the soil for years. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. Residual saturation is important as it determines the degree of soil contamination and can act as a continuing source of contamination for individual compounds to separate from the bulk product and migrate independently in air or groundwater. When the amount of product released to the environment is small relative to the volume of available soil, all of the product is converted to residual saturation and downward migration of the bulk product usually ceases prior to affecting groundwater resources. Adverse impacts to groundwater may still occur if rain water infiltrates through soil containing residual saturation and initiates the downward migration of individual compounds. When the amount of product released is large relative to the volume of available soil, the downward migration of bulk product ceases as water-saturated pore spaces are encountered. If the density of the bulk product is less than that of water, the product tends to \"float\" along the interface between the water saturated and unsaturated zones and spread horizontally in a pancake-like layer, usually in the direction of groundwater flow. Almost all motor and heating oils are less dense than water. \u00a0If the density of the bulk product is greater than that of water, the product will continue to migrate downward through the water table aquifer under the continued influence of gravity. Downward migration ceases when the product is converted to residual saturation or when an impermeable surface is encountered.</p> <p>As the bulk product migrates through the soil column, individual compounds may separate from the mixture and migrate independently. Chemical transport properties such as volatility, solubility, and sorption potential are often used to evaluate and predict which compounds will likely separate from the mixture. Since petroleum products are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, the compounds characterized by relatively high vapor pressures tend to volatilise and enter the vapor phase. The exact composition of these vapors depends on the composition of the original product. Using gasoline as an example, compounds such as butane, propane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are preferentially volatilised. Because volatility represents transfer of the compound from the product or liquid phase to the air phase, it is expected that the concentration of that compound in the product or liquid phase will decrease as the concentration in the air phase increases.</p> <p>In general, compounds having a vapor pressure in excess of 10-2 mm Hg are more likely to be present in the air phase than in the liquid phase. Compounds characterized by vapor pressures less than 10-7 mm Hg are more likely to be associated with the liquid phase. Compounds possessing vapor pressures that are less than 10-2 mm Hg, but greater than 10-7 mm Hg, will have a tendency to exist in both the air and the liquid phases.</p> <p>Lighter petroleum products such as gasoline contain constituents with higher water solubility and volatility and lower sorption potential than heavier petroleum products such as fuel oil.</p> <p>Data compiled from gasoline spills and laboratory studies indicate that these light-fraction hydrocarbons tend to migrate readily through soil, potentially threatening or affecting groundwater supplies. In contrast, petroleum products with heavier molecular weight constituents, such as fuel oil, are generally more persistent in soils, due to their relatively low water solubility and volatility and high sorption capacity. Solubility generally decreases with increasing molecular weight of the hydrocarbon compounds. For compounds having similar molecular weights, the aromatic hydrocarbons are more water soluble and mobile in water than the aliphatic hydrocarbons and branched aliphatics are less water-soluble than straight-chained aliphatics. Aromatic compounds in petroleum fuels may comprise as much as 50% by weight; aromatic compounds in the C6-C13, range made up approximately 95% of the compounds dissolved in water.</p> <p>Indigenous microbes found in many natural settings (e.g., soils, groundwater, ponds) have been shown to be capable of degrading organic compounds. Unlike other fate processes that disperse contaminants in the environment, biodegradation can eliminate the contaminants without transferring them across media.</p> <p>The final products of microbial degradation are carbon dioxide, water, and microbial biomass. The rate of hydrocarbon degradation depends on the chemical composition of the product released to the environment as well as site-specific environmental factors. Generally the straight chain hydrocarbons and the aromatics are degraded more readily than the highly branched aliphatic compounds. The n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and the aromatics in the C10-C22 range are the most readily biodegradable; n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics in the C5-C9 range are biodegradable at low concentrations by some microorganisms, but are generally preferentially removed by volatilisation and thus are unavailable in most environments; n-alkanes in the C1-C4 ranges are biodegradable only by a narrow range of specialized hydrocarbon degraders; and n-alkanes, n-alkyl aromatics, and aromatics above C22 are generally not available to degrading microorganisms. Hydrocarbons with condensed ring structures, such as PAHs with four or more rings, have been shown to be relatively resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. PAHs with only 2 or 3 rings (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene) are more easily biodegraded. A large proportion of the water-soluble fraction of the petroleum product may be degraded as the compounds go into solution. As a result, the remaining product may become enriched in the alicyclics, the highly branched aliphatics, and PAHs with many fused rings.</p> <p>In almost all cases, the presence of oxygen is essential for effective biodegradation of oil. Anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons leads to extremely low rates of degradation. The ideal pH range to promote biodegradation is close to neutral (6-8). For most species, the optimal pH is slightly alkaline, that is, greater than 7. The moisture content of the contaminated soil will affect biodegradation of oils due to dissolution of the residual compounds, dispersive actions, and the need for microbial metabolism to sustain high activity. The moisture content in soil affects microbial locomotion, solute diffusion, substrate supply, and the removal of metabolic by-products. Biodegradation rates in soils are also affected by the volume of product released to the environment. At concentrations of 0.5% of oil by volume, the degradation rate in soil is fairly independent of oil concentrations. However, as oil concentration rises, the first order degradation rate decreases and the oil degradation half-life increases. Ultimately, when the oil reaches saturation conditions in the soil (i.e., 30-50% oil), biodegradation virtually ceases.</p> <p>Excessive moisture will limit the gaseous supply of oxygen for enhanced decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons. Most studies indicate that optimum moisture content is within 50-70% of the water holding capacity.</p> <p>All biological transformations are affected by temperature. Generally, as the temperature increases, biological activity tends to increase up to a temperature where enzyme denaturation occurs. The presence of oil should increase soil temperature, particularly at the surface. The darker color increases the heat capacity by adsorbing more radiation. The optimal temperature for biodegradation to occur ranges from 18 C to 30 C. Minimum rates would be expected at 5 C or lower.</p> #90pa",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Odour threshold: 0.25 ppm.</p> <p>The TLV-TWA is protective against ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation and is recommended for bulk handling of gasoline based on calculations of hydrocarbon content of gasoline vapour. A STEL is recommended to prevent mucous membrane and ocular irritation and prevention of acute depression of the central nervous system. Because of the wide variation in molecular weights of its components, the conversion of ppm to mg/m3 is approximate. Sweden recommends hexane type limits of 100 ppm and heptane and octane type limits of 300 ppm. Germany does not assign a value because of the widely differing compositions and resultant differences in toxic properties.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor (OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.042 (gasoline)</p> <p>for petroleum distillates:</p> <p>CEL TWA: 500 ppm, 2000 mg/m3 (compare OSHA TWA)</p> <p>(CEL = Chemwatch Exposure Limit)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposed individuals are\u00a0<b>NOT</b>\u00a0reasonably expected to be warned, by smell, that the Exposure Standard is being exceeded.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Odour Safety Factor (OSF) is determined to fall into either Class C, D or E.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0The Odour Safety Factor (OSF) is defined as:</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0OSF= Exposure Standard (TWA) ppm/ Odour Threshold Value (OTV) ppm</p> <p><br /></p> <p>\u00a0Classification into classes follows:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Class</p>  </td> <td> <p>OSF</p>  </td> <td> <p>Description</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>A</p>  </td> <td> <p>550</p>  </td> <td> <p>Over 90% of exposed individuals are aware by smell that the Exposure Standard (TLV-TWA for example) is being reached, even when distracted by working activities</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>B</p>  </td> <td> <p>26-550</p>  </td> <td> <p>As \"A\" for 50-90% of persons being distracted</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>C</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-26</p>  </td> <td> <p>As \"A\" for less than 50% of persons being distracted</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>D</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.18-1</p>  </td> <td> <p>10-50% of persons aware of being tested perceive by smell that the Exposure Standard is being reached</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>E</p>  </td> <td> <p>&lt;0.18</p>  </td> <td> <p>As \"D\" for less than 10% of persons aware of being tested</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> #REL TWA: 370 ppm                                                 [SHELL]#Odour Safety Factor(OSF)#OSF=0.042 (BENZENE)",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

[PATTYS]\u00a0</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",

Biodegradation of n-heptane may occur in soil and water, however volatilisation and adsorption are expected to be more important fate processes. A high Koc (2400-8200) indicates n-heptane will be slightly mobile to immobile in soil. In aquatic systems n-heptane may partition from the water column to organic matter in sediments and suspended solids. The bioconcentration of n-heptane may be important in aquatic environments. the Henry's Law constant suggests rapid volatilisation from environmental waters and surface soils. The volatilisation half-lives from a model river and a model pond (the latter considers the effect of adsorption) have been estimated to be 2.9 hr and 13 days, respectively.</p> <p>n-Heptane is expected to exist entirely in the vapour phase in ambient air. Reactions with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere have been shown to be important (estimated half-life of 2.4 days calculated from its rate constant of 7.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C). Data also suggests that night-time reactions with nitrate radicals may contribute to the atmospheric transformation of n-heptane, especially in urban environments. n-Heptane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight</p> <p>An estimated BCF of 2,000 using \u00a0log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Based on 100% degradation after 4 days in water inoculated with gasoline contaminated soil and 100% degradation after 25 days in water inoculated with activated sewage sludge, biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for n-heptane in water.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Fish LC50 (48 h): goldfish (Carrasius auratus) 4 mg/l; golden orfe (Idus melanotus) 2940 mg/l; western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) 4924 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (24 h): &gt;10 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 (96 h): 82 mg/l (immobilisation)</p> <p>Opposum shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia) LC50 (96 h): 0.1 mg/l</p> <p>Snail EC50 (96 h): 472 mg/l</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Ventilation equipment should be explosion-resistant.</p> <p>Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Type of Contaminant:</p>  </td> <td> <p>Air Speed:</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>solvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.25-0.5 m/s</p> <p>(50-100 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>aerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)</p>  </td> <td> <p>0.5-1 m/s</p> <p>(100-200 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>direct spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active generation into zone of rapid air motion)\u00a0</p>  </td> <td> <p>1-2.5 m/s</p> <p>(200-500 f/min.)</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Within each range the appropriate value depends on:</p> <p><table> <tr> <td> <p>Lower end of the range</p>  </td> <td> <p>Upper end of the range</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture</p>  </td> <td> <p>1: Disturbing room air currents</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.\u00a0</p>  </td> <td> <p>2: Contaminants of high toxicity</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3: Intermittent, low production.</p>  </td> <td> <p>3: High production, heavy use</p>  </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4: Large hood or large air mass in motion</p>  </td> <td> <p>4: Small hood-local control only</p>  </td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Simple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Inhalation, by humans, of 1000 ppm heptane for 6 minutes was associated with slight dizziness; inhalation of higher concentrations for shorter periods, resulted in marked vertigo, incoordination, and hilarity. Signs of central nervous system system (CNS) involvement occurred in the absence of noticeable mucous membrane irritation and were noticed promptly on entering such atmospheres.</p> <p>Concentrations of 10,000-15,000 ppm, heptane produced narcosis on mice within 30-50 minutes. Exposure at higher concentrations (15,000-20,000 ppm) for 30-60 minutes caused convulsions and death in mice; inhalation of 48,000 ppm produced respiratory arrest in three of four head-exposed mice within 3 minutes. Brief exposure ( 4 minutes) to high levels (5000 ppm) produced nausea, loss of appetite and a \"gasoline-taste\" that persisted for several hours post-exposure.</p>",

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>In general, the alicyclic hydrocarbons produce less discomfort than the corresponding aromatic compounds.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Material is highly volatile and may quickly form a concentrated atmosphere in confined or unventilated areas. The vapour \u00a0 may displace and replace air in breathing zone, acting as a simple asphyxiant. This may happen with little warning of overexposure.</p> <p>Rabbits survived 8 hour exposures to cyclohexane at 18500 ppm but 26600 ppm was lethal after 1 hour exposure. A concentration of 12600 ppm produced lethargy, narcosis, increased respiration rate and convulsions- 3330 ppm failed to elicit an effect. 300 ppm is reported to be irritating to human eyes and mucous membranes.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p><br /></p> <p>Although the liquid is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may produce transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn).</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p><br /></p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either produces inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or produces significant inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals, for up to four hours, such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period. Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Skin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects.

As with many alkanes, experimental methods for the estimation\r\nof the Koc parameter are lacking, so that estimates must be made based on\r\ntheoretical considerations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The dominant transport process from water is volatilization. Based\r\non mathematical models the half-life for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane in bodies of\r\nwater with any degree of turbulent mixing (e.g., rivers) would be less than 3\r\nhours. For standing bodies of water (e.g. small ponds), a half-life no longer\r\nthan one week (6.8 days) is estimated Based on the log octanol/water partition\r\ncoefficient (i.e. log[Koc]) and the estimated log sorption coefficient (i.e.\r\nlog[Koc])\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is not expected to become concentrated in biota.\r\nA calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 453 for a fathead minnow further\r\nsuggests a low potential for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane to bioconcentrate or\r\nbioaccumulate in trophic food chains.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In soil, the dominant transport mechanism for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\npresent near the surface probably is volatilisation (based on its Henry\u2019s law\r\nconstant, water solubility, vapor pressure, and Koc). While its estimated Koc\r\nvalues suggest a moderate ability to sorb to soil particles,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nhas a density (0.6603 g/mL at 20 C) well below that of water and a very low\r\nwater solubility of 9.5 mg/L.\u00a0<i>n-</i>Hexane would, therefore, be viewed\r\nas a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), which would suggest a low potential\r\nfor leaching into the lower soil depths since the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane would\r\ntend to float on the top of the saturated zone of the water table.\u00a0<i>n-</i>Hexane\r\nwould generally stay near the soil surface and, if not appreciably sorbed into\r\nthe soil matrix, would be expected eventually to volatilise to the atmosphere.\r\nExceptions would involve locations with shallow groundwater tables where there\r\nwere large spills of hexane products. In such cases, the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\ncould spread out to contaminant a large volume of soil materials.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Air:\u00a0</span></b><i><span style=\"color:black\">n-</span></i><span style=\"color:black\">Hexane\r\ndoes not absorb ultraviolet (UV) light at 290 nm and is thus not expected to\r\nundergo direct photolysis reactions. The dominant tropospheric removal\r\nmechanism for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is generally regarded to be decomposition by\r\nhydroxyl radicals. Calculations assuming typical hydroxyl radical\r\nconcentrations suggest a half-life of approximately 2.9 days. While\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\ncan react with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone precursors under controlled\r\nlaboratory conditions, the smog-producing potential of\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is\r\nvery low compared to that of other alkanes or chlorinated VOCs. Hydroxyl ion\r\nreactions in the upper troposphere, therefore, are probably the primary\r\nmechanisms for\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane degradation in the atmosphere. As with most\r\nalkanes,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane is resistant to hydrolysis</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Water:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">Although few data are available\r\ndealing explicitly with the biodegradation of\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane in water,\r\nneither hydrolysis nor biodegradation in surface waters appears to be rapid\r\ncompared with volatilization. In surface waters, as in the atmosphere, alkanes\r\nsuch as\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane would be resistant to hydrolysis. Biodegradation\r\nis probably the most significant degradation mechanism in groundwater. The\r\nability of\u00a0<i>Pseudomonas mendocina\u00a0</i>bacteria to metabolise\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nin laboratory microcosms simulating groundwater conditions has been documented.\r\nMixed bacterial cultures as well as pure cultures are documented as capable of\r\nmetabolizing\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane under aerobic conditions. In general, linear\r\nalkanes (such as\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane) are viewed as the most readily biodegradable\r\nfractions in petroleum , particularly when oxygen is present in solution. Once\r\nintroduced into groundwater,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane may be fairly persistent\r\nsince its degradation by chemical hydrolysis is slow and opportunities for\r\nbiodegradation may be limited under anoxic conditions or where nutrients such\r\nas nitrogen or phosphorus are in limited supply</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Sediment and Soil:\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color:black\">The most\r\nimportant biodegradation processes involve the conversion of the\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane\r\nto primary alcohols, aldehydes and, ultimately, into fatty acids. Similar\r\nprocesses are encountered with other light hydrocarbons such as heptane. In\r\ngeneral, unless the\u00a0<i>n</i>-hexane is buried at some depth within a soil\r\nor sediment, volatilisation is generally assumed to occur at a much more rapid\r\nrate than chemical or biochemical degradation processes. Once introduced into\r\ndeeper sediments,\u00a0<i>n-</i>hexane may be fairly persistent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><span style=\"color:black\">Ecotoxicity:</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fish LC50 (96 h): Oncorhyncus mykiss 4.14 mg/l; Pimephales\r\npromelus 2.5 mg/l (flow through); Lepomis macrochirus 4.12 mg/l</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Daphnia EC50 (48 h): 3.87 mg/l</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The STEL is added to prevent objective depression of the CNS. The lower value ascribed</p> <p>to n-hexane is due to the neurotoxicity of its metabolites, principally 5-hydroxy-2-hexanone and 2,5-hexanedione. It is considered unlikely that other hexanes follow the same metabolic route. It should be noted however that the n-hexane TLV-TWA also applies to commercial hexane having a concentration of greater than 5% n-hexane.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>For n-hexane:</p> <p>Odour Threshold Value: 65 ppm</p> <p>NOTE: Detector tubes for n-hexane, measuring in excess of 100 ppm, are available commercially.</p> <p>Occupational polyneuropathy may result from exposures as low as 500 ppm (as hexane), whilst nearly continuous exposures of 250 ppm have caused neurotoxic effects in animals. Many literature reports have failed to distinguish hexane from n-hexane and on the assumption that the commercial hexane contains 30% n-hexane, a worst case recommendation for TLV is assumed to reduce the risk of peripheral neuropathies (due to the metabolites 2,5-heptanedione and 3,6-octanedione) and other adverse neuropathic effects.</p> <p>Concurrent exposure to chemicals (including MEK) and drugs which induce hepatic liver oxidative metabolism can reduce the time for neuropathy to appear.</p> <p>Odour Safety Factor(OSF)</p> <p>OSF=0.15 (n-HEXANE)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Exposure limits with \"skin\" notation indicate that vapour and liquid may be absorbed through intact skin. Absorption by skin may readily exceed vapour inhalation exposure. Symptoms for skin absorption are the same as for inhalation. Contact with eyes and mucous membranes may also contribute to overall exposure and may also invalidate the exposure standard.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Established occupational exposure limits frequently do not take into consideration reproductive end points that are clearly below the thresholds for other toxic effects. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard. These have been established after a literature search for the reproductive no-observed-adverse effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

They occur either as products of commerce (e.g. 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-heptanedione, 3,6-octanedione) or as metabolites (of, for example, n-hexane and 2-hexanone). The neurotoxic syndrome is best described as a sensorimotor or motor polyneuropathy. The initial symptoms are symmetrical sensory numbness and paraesthesias of the distal portions of the extremities. Sensory loss usually involves all modalities of the feet or hands. Motor weakness is typically observed in the muscles of the toes and fingers but may also involve the muscles of arms, thighs and forearms. Onset of symptoms may be delayed for several months to a year after the initial exposure. Pathologically the syndrome is characterised by a swelling of the axon, demyelination and nerve fibre degradation resembling a dying-back neuropathy.</p> <p>Central and autonomic nervous systems are unaffected.</p> <p>The clinical course of the disease following removal from exposure is complete recovery, but severe cases may retain sensorimotor deficits.</p>",
