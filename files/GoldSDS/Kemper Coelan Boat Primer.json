Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Exposure to doses sufficiently high to produce intoxication and unconsciousness also produces transient liver and kidney toxicity.

Intentional toluene exposure (glue-sniffing) at maternally-intoxicating concentration has also produced birth defects. Foetotoxicity appears at levels associated with CNS narcosis and probably occurs only in those with chronic toluene-induced kidney failure. Exposure at or below the recommended TLV-TWA is thought to prevent transient headache and irritation, to provide a measure of safety for possible disturbances to human reproduction, the prevention of reductions in cognitive responses reported amongst humans inhaling greater than 40 ppm, and the significant risks of hepatotoxic, behavioural and nervous system effects (including impaired reaction time and incoordination).

Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) have been suggested as an additional standard.

In addition the US EPA's procedures for risk assessment for hazard identification and dose-response assessment as applied by NIOSH were used in the creation of such limits.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p>",

                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

In 96-hr algal toxicity testing, results indicate that ethylbenzene inhibits algae growth in\u00a0<i>Selenastrum capricornatum\u00a0</i>at 3.6 mg/L and in\u00a0<i>Skeletonema costatum\u00a0</i>at 7.7 mg/L.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the<b><i>\u00a0Fish LC50 (96 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",
                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>When humans were exposed to the 100 and 200 ppm for 8 hours about 45-65% is retained in the body. Only traces of unchanged ethyl benzene are excreted in expired air following termination of inhalation exposure.</p> <p>Humans exposed to concentrations of 23-85 ppm excreted most of the retained dose in the urine (mainly as metabolites). Guinea pigs that died from exposure had intense congestion of the lungs and generalised visceral hyperaemia. Rats exposed for three days at 8700 mg/m3 (2000 ppm) showed changes in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in various parts of the brain.</p> <p>The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined space may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmosphere developing.

Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Two drops of the ethylbenzene in to the conjunctival sac produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival membrane but no corneal injury.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The material may produce mild skin irritation; limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material either:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>produces mild inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but mild, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p>Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (non allergic).

Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>The mean rate of absorption of liquid ethyl benzene applied to 17.3 cm2 area of the forearm of seven volunteers for 10-15 minutes was determined to be 38 mg/cm2/hr. Immersion of the whole hand in aqueous solutions of ethyl benzene (112-156 mg/l) for 1 hour yielded mean absorption rates of 118 and 215.7 ug/cm2/hr. The rate of absorption is thus greater than that of aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide and styrene.</p> <p>Repeated application of the undiluted product to the abdominal area of rabbits (10-20 applications over 2-4 weeks) resulted in erythema, oedema and superficial necrosis.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

The two isomeric forms are shown above. The di- and tripropylene glycol ethers may form up to 4 and 8 isomeric forms, respectively. Even so, all isomers exhibit either the \"alpha\" or \"beta\" configuration, existing as secondary or primary alcohols, respectively. The distribution of isomeric forms for the di- and tripropylene glycols, as with the mono-PGEs, also results in predominantly the alpha form (i.e., a secondary alcohol). It should be noted that only the alpha isomer and isomeric mixtures (consisting predominantly of the alpha isomer) are produced commercially; the purified beta isomer is not produced at this time.</p>",

Investigation of the hazards associated with use of 2-butoxyethanol for alloy electropolishing showed that mixtures with 50-95% of acid at 20 deg C, or 40-90% at 75 C, were explosive and initiable by sparks. Sparking caused mixtures with 40-50% of acid to become explosive, but 30% solutions appeared safe under static conditions of temperature and concentration.</li> </ul> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Propylene glycol <u>monomethyl</u>\r\nether (PGME):</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">reacts violently with strong oxidisers, alkalis</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">is incompatible with aliphatic amines, boranes, sulfuric acid,\r\nnitric acid, perchloric acid, caustics, isocyanates</span></p> <ul> <li>Avoid reaction with oxidising agents\u00a0</li> </ul>",

Calculated BCFs range from 1.47 for DPnB to 3.16 for DPMA and TPM, indicating low bioaccumulation. Henry's Law Constants, which indicate propensity to partition from water to air, are low for all category members, ranging from 5.7 x 10-9 atm-m3/mole for TPM to 2.7 x10-9 atm-m3/mole for PnB. Fugacity modeling indicates that most propylene glycol ethers are likely to partition roughly equally into the soil and water compartments in the environment with small to negligible amounts remaining in other environmental compartments (air, sediment, and aquatic biota). Propylene glycol ethers are unlikely to persist in the environment. Once in air, the half-life of the category members due to direct reactions with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals, range from 2.0 hours for TPM to 4.6 hours for PnB. In water, most \u00a0members of this family \u00a0are \"readily biodegradable\" under aerobic conditions. (DPMA degraded within 28 days (and within the specified 10-day window) but only using pre-adapted or \"acclimated\" inoculum.). In soil, biodegradation is rapid for PM and PMA.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute aquatic toxicity testing indicates low toxicity for both ethers and acetates. For ethers, effect concentrations are &gt; 500 mg/L. For acetates, effect concentrations are &gt; 151 mg/L.</p> <p>For glycol ethers:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Ether groups are generally stable to hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions and ambient temperatures. OECD guideline studies indicate ready biodegradability for several glycol ethers although higher molecular weight species seem to biodegrade at a slower rate. No glycol ethers that have been tested demonstrate marked resistance to biodegradative processes. Upon release to the atmosphere by evaporation, high boiling glycol ethers are estimated to undergo photodegradation (atmospheric half lives = 2.4-2.5 hr). When released to water, glycol ethers undergo biodegradation (typically 47-92% after 8-21 days) and have a low potential for bioaccumulation (log Kow ranges from -1.73 to +0.51).</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Aquatic toxicity data indicate that the tri- and tetra ethylene glycol ethers are \"practically non-toxic\" to aquatic species. No major differences are observed in the order of toxicity going from the methyl- to the butyl ethers.</p> <p>Glycols exert a high oxygen demand for decomposition and once released to the environments cause the death of aquatic organisms if dissolved oxygen is depleted.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for propylene glycol <u>monomethyl</u>\r\nether (PGME)</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Odour Threshold: 10 ppm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The TLV-TWA is protective against\r\ndiscomfort caused by odour, against eye and skin irritation, and chronic\r\neffects (including possible liver and kidney damage).</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Individuals exposed to 100 ppm\r\nreported a transient unpleasant odour with slight eye irritation after about 1 or\r\n2 hours.

The metabolic acetic acid derivatives of glycol ethers (alkoxyacetic acids), not the ether itself, have been found to be the proximal reproductive toxin in animals. The potency of these metabolites decreases significantly as the chain length of the ether increases. Consequently glycol ethers with longer substituents (e.g diethylene glycols, triethylene glycols) have not generally been associated with reproductive effects. One of the most sensitive indicators of toxic effects observed from many of the glycol ethers is an increase in the erythrocytic osmotic fragility in rats Which produces haemolytic anaemia). This appears to be related to the development of haemoglobinuria (blood in the urine) at higher exposure levels or as a result of chronic exposure.</p> <p>Glycol ethers based on propylene oxides, propylene glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers and tripropylene glycol ethers are mainly available, commercially, as alpha-isomers (because of thermodynamic considerations); these are incapable of forming alkoxyacetic or alkoxypropionic acids as metabolites and therefore do not produce erythrocyte fragility unless contaminated by ethylene glycol ethers or to a significant degree by the beta-isomer . beta-Isomers are able to form the alkoxypropionic acids and these are linked to teratogenic effects (and possibly haemolytic effects).</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">Repeated oral doses of 3 g/kg for\r\npropylene glycol <u>monomethyl</u> ether (PGME) produced minor changes in the\r\nliver and kidneys in rats.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Volatilisation of p-xylene is expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 7.18x10-3 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilisation of 3-xylene from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a measured vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg. p-Xylene may be degraded during its passage through soil). The extent of the degradation is expected to depend on its concentration, residence time in the soil, the nature of the soil, and whether resident microbial populations have been acclimated. p-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days. In aquifer studies under anaerobic conditions, p-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks, with the production of 3-methylbenzylfumaric acid, 3-methylbenzylsuccinic acid, 3-methylbenzoate, and 3-methylbenzaldehyde as metabolites.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>Koc values indicate that p-xylene may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. p-Xylene is expected to volatilise from water surfaces based on the measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCF values of 14.8, 23.4, and 6, measured in goldfish, eels, and clams, respectively, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. p-Xylene in water with added humic substances was 50% degraded following 3 hours irradiation suggesting that indirect photooxidation in the presence of humic acids may play an important role in the abiotic degradation of p-xylene. Although p-xylene is biodegradable and has been observed to degrade in pond water, there are insufficient data to assess the rate of this process in surface waters. p-Xylene has been observed to degrade in anaerobic and aerobic groundwater in several studies; however, it is known to persist for many years in groundwater, at least at sites where the concentration might have been quite high.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate:\u00a0</b></p> <p>Most xylenes released to the environment will occur in the atmosphere and volatilisation is the dominant environmental fate process. In the ambient atmosphere, xylenes are expected to exist solely in the vapour phase. Xylenes are degraded in the atmosphere primarily by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of about 0.5 to 2 days. Xylenes' susceptibility to photochemical oxidation in the troposphere is to the extent that they may contribute to photochemical smog formation.</p> <p>According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and from its vapour pressure, p-xylene, is expected to exist solely as a vapour in the ambient atmosphere. Vapour-phase p-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 16 hours. A half-life of 1.0 hr in summer and 10 hr in winter was measured for the reaction of p-xylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. p-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr. The photooxidation of p-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzylnitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, and 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>for xylenes</p> <p>Fish LC50 (96 h) Pimephales promelas 13.4 mg/l; Oncorhyncus mykiss 8.05 mg/l; Lepomis macrochirus 16.1 mg/l (all flow through values); Pimephales promelas 26.7 (static)</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 948 h): 3.83 mg/l</p> <p>Photobacterium phosphoreum EC50 (24 h): 0.0084 mg/l</p> <p>Gammarus lacustris LC50 (48 h): 0.6 mg/l \u00a0</p> <p><br /></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

                "AcuteInhaled": "<p>Evidence shows, or practical experience predicts, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>The acute toxicity of inhaled alkylbenzenes is best described by central nervous system depression. As a rule, these compounds may also act as general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Systemic poisoning produced by general anaesthesia is characterised by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting and sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness and respiratory depression and arrest. Cardiac arrest may result from cardiovascular collapse. Bradycardia, and hypotension may also be produced.</p> <p>Inhaled alkylbenzene vapours cause death in animals at air levels that are relatively similar (typically LC50s are in the range 5000 -8000 ppm for 4 to 8 hour exposures). It is likely that acute inhalation exposure to alkylbenzenes resembles that to general anaesthetics.</p> <p>Alkylbenzenes are not generally toxic other than at high levels of exposure. This may be because their metabolites have a low order of toxicity and are easily excreted. There is little or no evidence to suggest that metabolic pathways can become saturated leading to spillover to alternate pathways. Nor is there evidence that toxic reactive intermediates, which may produce subsequent toxic or mutagenic effects, are formed</p> <p>Inhalation hazard is increased at higher temperatures.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>High inhaled concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons may produce narcosis characterised by nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness. Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness. Many of the petroleum hydrocarbons are cardiac sensitisers and may cause ventricular fibrillations.</p> <p>Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. \u00a0Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>A significant number of individuals exposed to mixed trimethylbenzenes complained of nervousness, tension, anxiety and asthmatic bronchitis. Peripheral blood showed a tendency to hypochromic anaemia and a deviation from normal in coagulability of the blood. Hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from 10 to 60 ppm. Contamination of the mixture with benzene may have been responsible for the blood dyscrasias.</p> <p>High concentrations of mesitylene vapour (5000 to 9000 ppm) caused central nervous system depression in mice. Similar exposures of pseudocumene also produced evidence of CNS involvement.</p> <p>Acute effects from inhalation of high concentrations of vapour are pulmonary irritation, including coughing, with nausea; central nervous system depression - characterised by headache and dizziness, increased reaction time, fatigue and loss of co-ordination</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Headache, fatigue, lassitude, irritability and gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, anorexia and flatulence) are the most common symptoms of xylene overexposure. Injury to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system has also been noted amongst workers. Transient memory loss, renal impairment, temporary confusion and some evidence of disturbance of liver function was reported in three workers overcome by gross exposure to xylene (10000 ppm). One worker died and autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion, oedema and focal alveolar haemorrhage. Volunteers inhaling xylene at 100 ppm for 5 to 6 hours showed changes in manual coordination reaction time and slight ataxia. Tolerance developed during the workweek but was lost over the weekend. Physical exercise may antagonise this effect. Xylene body burden in humans exposed to 100 or 200 ppm xylene in air depends on the amount of body fat with 4% to 8% of total absorbed xylene accumulating in adipose tissue.</p> <p>Xylene is a central nervous system depressant. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may include nonspecific discomfort, symptoms of giddiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, anaesthetic effects, slowed reaction time, slurred speech and may progress to unconsciousness. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>Inhalation of aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be harmful.</p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p><br /></p> <p>Petroleum hydrocarbons may produce pain after direct contact with the eyes. Slight, but transient disturbances of the corneal epithelium may also result. The aromatic fraction may produce irritation and lachrymation.</p> <p>Evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material may cause severe eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals and/or may produce significant ocular lesions which are present twenty-four hours or more after instillation into the eye(s) of experimental animals. Eye contact may cause significant inflammation with pain. Corneal injury may occur; permanent impairment of vision may result unless treatment is prompt and adequate. Repeated or prolonged exposure to irritants may cause inflammation characterised by a temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid produces a high level of eye discomfort and is capable of causing pain and severe conjunctivitis. Corneal injury may develop, with possible permanent impairment of vision, if not promptly and adequately treated.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material produces moderate skin irritation; evidence exists, or practical experience predicts, that the material either</p> <ul> <li>\u00a0produces moderate inflammation of the skin in a substantial number of individuals following direct contact, and/or\u00a0</li> <li>produces significant, but moderate, inflammation when applied to the healthy intact skin of animals (for up to four hours), such inflammation being present twenty-four hours or more after the end of the exposure period.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis. At the microscopic level there may be intercellular oedema of the spongy layer of the skin (spongiosis) and intracellular oedema of the epidermis.</p> <p>Repeated exposure may cause skin cracking, flaking or drying following normal handling and use.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The liquid may be miscible with fats or oils and may degrease the skin, producing a skin reaction described as non-allergic contact dermatitis. The material is unlikely to produce an irritant dermatitis as described in EC Directives .</p> <p>The material may accentuate any pre-existing dermatitis condition</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may be harmful; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons may produce skin irritation, vasodilation with erythema and changes in endothelial cell permeability. Systemic intoxication, resulting from contact with the light aromatics, is unlikely due to the slow rate of permeation. Branching of the side chain appears to increase percutaneous absorption.</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration of vomit into the lungs with the risk of haemorrhaging, pulmonary oedema, progressing to chemical pneumonitis; serious consequences may result.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of chemical (aspiration) pneumonitis may include coughing, gasping, choking, burning of the mouth, difficult breathing, and bluish coloured skin (cyanosis).</p> <p>Accidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Ingestion of petroleum hydrocarbons may produce irritation of the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine with oedema and mucosal ulceration resulting; symptoms include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Large amounts may produce narcosis with nausea and vomiting, weakness or dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, swelling of the abdomen, unconsciousness and convulsions. Myocardial injury may produce arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes. Central nervous system depression may also occur. Light aromatic hydrocarbons produce a warm, sharp, tingling sensation on contact with taste buds and may anaesthetise the tongue. Aspiration into the lungs may produce coughing, gagging and a chemical pneumonitis with pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage.</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>There is some evidence that human exposure to the material may result in developmental toxicity. This evidence is based on animal studies where effects have been observed in the absence of marked maternal toxicity, or at around the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not secondary non-specific consequences of the other toxic effects.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposure to mixed hydrocarbons may produce  narcosis with dizziness, weakness, irritability, concentration and/or  memory loss, tremor in the fingers and tongue, vertigo, olfactory  disorders, constriction of visual field, paraesthesias of the  extremities, weight loss and anaemia and degenerative changes in the  liver and kidney. Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p>Prolonged or repeated contact with xylenes may cause defatting dermatitis with drying and cracking. Chronic inhalation of xylenes has been associated with central nervous system effects, loss of appetite, nausea, ringing in the ears, irritability, thirst anaemia, mucosal bleeding, enlarged liver and hyperplasia. Exposure may produce kidney and liver damage. In chronic occupational exposure, xylene (usually mix ed with other solvents) has produced irreversible damage to the central nervous system and ototoxicity (damages hearing and increases sensitivity to noise), probably due to neurotoxic mechanisms.</p> <p>Industrial workers exposed to xylene with a maximum level of ethyl benzene of 0.06 mg/l (14 ppm) reported headaches and irritability and tired quickly. Functional nervous system disturbances were found in some workers employed for over 7 years whilst other workers had enlarged livers.\u00a0</p> <p>Xylene has been classed as a developmental toxin in some jurisdictions.</p> <p>Small excess risks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation were reported amongst women exposed to xylene in the first trimester of pregnancy. In all cases, however, the women were also been exposed to other substances. Evaluation of workers chronically exposed to xylene has demonstrated lack of genotoxicity. Exposure to xylene has been associated with increased risks of haemopoietic malignancies but, again, simultaneous exposure to other substances (including benzene) complicates the picture. A long-term gavage study to mixed xylenes (containing 17% ethyl benzene) found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice of either sex.</p> <p>Exposure to the material for prolonged periods may cause physical defects in the developing embryo (teratogenesis).</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

Inhaled cardioselective bronchodilators (e.g. Alupent, Salbutamol) are the preferred agents, with aminophylline a second choice.\u00a0</li> <li>Lavage is indicated in patients who require decontamination; ensure use of cuffed endotracheal tube in adult patients.

Therefore emesis should not be induced mechanically or pharmacologically. Mechanical means should be used if it is considered necessary to evacuate the stomach contents; these include gastric lavage after endotracheal intubation.

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Inhalation of aerosols may produce severe pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage. Inhalation of petroleum hydrocarbons consisting substantially of low molecular weight species (typically C2-C12) may produce irritation of mucous membranes, incoordination, giddiness, nausea, vertigo, confusion, headache, appetite loss, drowsiness, tremors and anaesthetic stupor. Massive exposures may produce central nervous system depression with sudden collapse and deep coma; fatalities have been recorded. Irritation of the brain and/or apnoeic anoxia may produce convulsions. Although recovery following overexposure is generally complete, cerebral micro-haemorrhage of focal post-inflammatory scarring may produce epileptiform seizures some months after the exposure. Pulmonary episodes may include chemical pneumonitis with oedema and haemorrhage. The lighter hydrocarbons may produce kidney and neurotoxic effects. Pulmonary irritancy increases with carbon chain length for paraffins and olefins. Alkenes produce pulmonary oedema at high concentrations. Liquid paraffins may produce anaesthesia and depressant actions leading to weakness, dizziness, slow and shallow respiration, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. C5-7 paraffins may also produce polyneuropathy. Aromatic hydrocarbons accumulate in lipid rich tissues (typically the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) and may produce functional impairment manifested by nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, weakness, fatigue and vertigo; severe exposures may produce inebriation or unconsciousness.

Skin irritation may also be present after prolonged or repeated exposure; this may result in a form of contact dermatitis (nonallergic). The dermatitis is often characterised by skin redness (erythema) and swelling (oedema) which may progress to blistering (vesiculation), scaling and thickening of the epidermis.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p> <p>Repeated application of mildly hydrotreated oils (principally paraffinic), to mouse skin, induced skin tumours; no tumours were induced with severely hydrotreated oils.</p> <p>Chronic solvent inhalation exposures may result in nervous system impairment and liver and blood changes.

This term can be used to describe \u201csingle-component\u201d paints that dry\r\nin the air (whether latex house paint, or old school lacquer) and nearly all\r\naerosol spray can paints.\u00a0 </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Coatings based on aliphatic\r\npolyisocyanates, for example, usually need longer drying times than those based\r\non aromatic polyisocyanates. Drying times depend on the presence of atmospheric\r\nmoisture, as well as the temperature. One-component systems can generally cure\r\nat a wide range of temperatures. Coatings based on polyisocyanates or on\r\nNCO-functional prepolymers may harden at room temperature. Those based on\r\nblocked NCO prepolymers will require baking at temperatures up to 180 deg C.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Weathering properties of 1K\r\ncoatings also largely depend on the isocyanate basis used. Coatings based on\r\ntoluylene diisocyanate (TDI) or diphenlymethane diisocyanate (MDI)\r\npolyisocyanates have a tendency to yellow when exposed to light and display a\r\ncertain loss of gloss with weathering. Those based on hexamethylene\r\ndiisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and Desmodur W (H12MDI) are\r\nlight stable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">2K polyurethane (PU) systems dry\r\nrelatively quickly without exposure to heat due to their reactive NCO groups.\r\nIn some applications, these systems are force-dried at up to 80 deg C or baked\r\nat temperatures above 120 deg C to yield even shorter curing times.

All of them function on the  principle of colourimetric evaluation of an indicator paper strip. They  are operating continuously and unattended. Paper tape systems are easy  to use and do not require skilled analysts to operate them. They give  rapid results and are therefore suitable for leak detection and in  emergency situations. However,:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they may read incorrect at very high or very low humidity, </li>\n<li>are unsuitable for aerosols </li>\n<li>and may not be accepted for purposes of regulatory compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Air  monitoring of isocyanates requires sound analytical knowledge. In order  to obtain reliable results only laboratories with experience in that  specific area should be engaged with such measurements<br /><br />In the  evaluation of the German MAK Commission the justification of the OEL for  4,4\u00b4- MDI/ pMDI is established based on the isocyanate (NCO) group  which is common to the monomeric, oligomeric and the polymeric MDIs.  This NCO group is highly reactive (see toxicokinetics and category  justification for details). Due to this high reactivity of the  functional NCO group towards nucleophilic biomolecules the primary  health effect of MDI is irritation at the point of contact, which can be  demonstrated by the numerous acute, subacute and chronic bioassays, and  sensitization.<br />The most sensitive health effect resulting from acute  inhalation exposure to respirable aerosols of MDI is irritation to  predominately the bronchio-alveolar part of the respiratory tract.<br />After  inhalation exposure, MDI reacts with nucleophilic low and  higher-molecular components of the liquid films that cover the airways,  glutathione (GSH) represents the most important nucleophile in  quantitative terms. The low-molecular adducts or conjugates of MDI are  absorbed and direct transcarbamoylation results in plasma protein  adducts (albumin, haemoglobin). All observed health effects resulting  from exposure to respirable aerosols in acute, subchronic or chronic  bioassays and human studies can be allocated to primary alveolar  reactivity (respiratory irritation and/or sensitization). No systemic  effect other than secondary to primary irritation has been described. <br />Biomonitoring  for exposure to diisocyanates typically looks to assay derivatives  (diamines) following hydrolysis of biological fluids and is routinely  employed to measure occupational exposure to MDI and other  diisocyanates. For diamine analysis, samples of urine are typically  used, although blood samples can also be used. However, these markers  are not specific for the diisocyanate exposure. The urine biomarkers  (after acid or base hydrolysis) reflected recent exposures whereas  certain haemoglobin (Hb)\u00a0 biomarkers did not necessarily correlate with  the urine biomarkers, and were considered to reflect overall exposures  over a longer term. The hydrolysis methods and conditions used release  differing amounts of the diamine analyte.<br />Hydrolysis analytes are at  low concentrations and proportionally little of the dose is in urine or  blood, and that there is no standardised method for measuring biomarkers  in hydrolyzed urine. Investigation of diisocyanate specific biomarkers  has focused on the conjugated molecules in blood. Typically, conjugates  with Hb or albumin (Alb) have been assessed, and\u00a0 there has been  progress in application of experiments in animals to biomonitoring of  human exposures to MDI. \u00a0<br />The role for glutathione as an intermediary  in transport of diisocyanates is now supported by good evidence using  various model compounds. The most probable reactions of isocyanates with  biological macromolecules are with the amine (mixed urea), the hydroxyl  (carbamate) and the sulphydryl (thiolytic acid ester) and that latter  is of a reversible nature.<br />The thiocarbamate bond of  isocyanate-sulphydryl is reversible, and various authors have found  release and transfer of MDI moieties from thiocarbamate conjugates to  other nucleophiles, notably protein. The conjugates were shown to be  recognised by serum IgG from MDI exposed workers, demonstrating a  non-enzymatic, thiol-mediated transcarbamolyating mechanism to protein. <br />The  methods to identify and quantify MDI-adducts to plasma proteins  particularly albumin (Alb) and to haemoglobin (Hb) have now been applied  to biological monitoring, particularly useful since the amount of  adducts would be indicative of an integrated exposure. In addition these  adducts are specific for MDI exposure. However the total amount of the  analyte MDA, retrievable from Hb-adducts and urinary precursors,  accounts for less than 0.5 % of the applied dose of MDI, and the lack of  linearity of biomarker to exposure dose makes uncertain the  extrapolation from the yield of biomarkers in urine or blood towards  inhalative MDI exposure. The use of protein adducts for biomonitoring  appears to overcome some of these difficulties and benefits from  specificity of the analyte. To date no diisocyanate specific urinary  biomarker has been identified. For blood, the MDI-specific methods  developed are: Hb-conjugate derived hydantoin, Alb-lysine conjugates and  peptide conjugates. On the basis of limits of detection, the  Hb-hydantoin method is most sensitive compared to the Alb-lysine method  which in turn is more sensitive than the signature peptide method. The  Hb-hydantoin method covers a longer period of exposure than the  Alb-lysine, due to the longer half life of the erythrocyte compared to  serum albumin.</p> <p>for isophorone diisocyanate:</p> <p>Toxicological action is similar to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and the recommended TLV-TWA for TDI is applied to isophorone diisocyanate until further information is available.</p> <p>Because skin sensitisation, allergic dermatitis and asthma have been reported amongst exposed workers, individuals who may be hypersusceptible or otherwise unusually responsive to chemicals may NOT be adequately protected from adverse health effects at concentrations at or below the recommended TLV. A STEL has not been published because there is no dose-response data to support a numerical exposure limit. It is thought that ACGIH excursion limits (0.015 ppm for 30 minutes total) provide equivalent health protection to short-term exposure limits promulgated by OSHA and recommended by NIOSH (0.02 ppm for 15 minutes).</p>",

There are health concerns\r\nfor isocyanates on the basis of their skin and respiratory sensitisation\r\nproperties and other lung effects e.g TDI and MDI). Aromatic isocyanates may be\r\npotentially carcinogenic (e.g. TDI and DADI). Frequently new chemical\r\nisocyanates are manufactured with a significant excess of isocyanate monomer.\r\nWhilst it is generally accepted that polymers with a molecular weight exceeding\r\n1000 are unlikely to pass through biological membranes, oligomers with lower\r\nmolecular weight and specifically, those with a molecular weight below 500,\r\nmay.

The choice of 10000 as a cut-off value is\r\nthought to provide a safety factor of 100, regarded as reasonable in light of\r\nlimited data, duration of studies, dose levels at which effects are seen, and\r\nextrapolation from animals to humans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p> <p>Persons with a history of asthma or other respiratory problems or are  known to be sensitised, should not be engaged in any work involving the  handling of isocyanates.<br />The chemistry of reaction of isocyanates,  as evidenced by MDI,\u00a0 in biological milieu is such that in the event of a  true exposure of small MDI doses to the mouth, reactions will commence  at once with biological macromolecules in the buccal region and will  continue along the digestive tract prior to reaching the stomach.  Reaction products will be a variety of polyureas and macromolecular  conjugates with for example mucus, proteins and cell components. <br />This  is corroborated by the results from an MDI inhalation study. Following  an inhalation exposure of rats to radiolabelled MDI, 79% of the dose was  excreted in faeces. The faecal excretion in these animals was  considered entirely due to ingestion of radioactivity from grooming and  ingestion of deposited material from the nasopharangeal region via the  mucociliary escalator, i.e. not following systemic absorption. The  faecal radioactivity was tentatively identified as mixed molecular  weight polyureas derived from MDI. Diamine was not present. Thus, for  MDI and diisocyanates in general the oral gavage dosing route is  inappropriate for toxicological studies and risk assessment. <br />It is  expected that oral gavage dosing will result in a similar outcome to  that produced by TDI or MDI, that is (1) reaction with stomach contents  and (2) polymerization to solid polyureas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reaction with  stomach contents is very plausibly described in case reports of  accidental ingestion of polymeric MDI based glue in domestic animals.  Extensive polymerization and CO2 liberation resulting in an expansion of  the gastric content is described in the stomach, without apparent acute  chemical toxicity </li>\n<li>Polyurea formation in organic and aqueous  phases has been described. In this generally accepted chemistry of  hydrolysis of an isocyanate the initially produced carbamate  decarboxylates to an amine which. The amine, as a reactive intermediate,  then reacts very readily with the present isocyanate to produce a solid  and inert polyurea. This urea formation acts as a pH buffer in the  stomach, thus promoting transformation of\u00a0 the diisocyanate into  polyurea, even under the acidic conditions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the  resorbtive tissues in the small intestine, these high molecular reaction  products are likely to be of very low bioavailability, which is  substantiated by the absence of systemic toxicity in acute oral  bioassays with rats at the OECD limit dose (LC50&gt;2 g/kg bw).<br />The  respiratory tract may be regarded as the main entry for systemically  available isocyanates as evidenced following MDI.exposures. <br />A  detailed summary on urinary, plasma and in vitro metabolite studies is  provided below. Taken together, all available studies provide convincing  evidence that MDI-protein adduct and MDI-metabolite formation proceeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>via formation of a labile isocyanate glutathione (GSH)-adduct, </li>\n<li>then transfer to a more stable adduct with larger proteins, and </li>\n<li>without  formation of free MDA. MDA reported as a metabolite is actually formed  by analytical workup procedures (strong acid or base hydrolysis) and is  not an identified metabolite in urine or blood</li>\n</ul> <p>A 90-day inhalation study in rats with polymeric MDI (6 hours/day, 5 days/week) produced moderate to severe hyperplastic inflammatory lesions in the nasal cavities and lungs at levels of 8 mg/m3 or greater.<br />Rats exposed for two years to a respirable aerosol of polymeric MDI exhibited chronic pulmonary irritation at high concentrations. Only at the highest level (6 mg/m3),was there a significant incidence of a benign tumour of the lung (adenoma) and one malignant tumour (adenocarcinoma).There were no lung tumours at 1 mg/m3 and no effects at 0.2 mg/m3. Overall, the tumour incidence, both benign and malignant and\u00a0 the number of animals with the tumours were not different from controls.The increased incidence of lung tumours is associated with prolonged respiratory irritation and the concurrent accumulation of yellow material in the lung, which occurred throughout the study.In the absence of prolonged exposure to high concentrations leading to chronic irritation and lung damage,it is highly unlikely that tumour formation will occur.</p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

If a di-isocyanate is\r\ntreated with a compound containing two or more hydroxyl groups, such as a diol\r\nor a polyol, polymer chains are formed, which are known as polyurethanes.\r\nReaction between a di-isocyanate and a compound containing two or more amine\r\ngroups, produces long polymer chains known as polyureas.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Isocyanates and thioisocyanates are incompatible with many classes\r\nof compounds, reacting exothermically to release toxic gases.

Symptoms can persist for several weeks. Most people recover completely.</p> <p>Both allergy-prone and non allergy-prone people can become sensitised. Cross sensitisation to other isocyanates may occur.</p> <p>With most allergens, removal of the offending agent results in asymptomatic individuals becoming asymptomatic. Isocyanate-induced asthmas may continue for months or even years after exposure ceases. This response may be due to a nonimmunologic condition known as reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS) which occurs following exposure to high levels of irritating compounds eg. smoke and air pollutants.</p> <p>Persons with a history of asthma or other respiratory problems or are  known to be sensitised, should not be engaged in any work involving the  handling of isocyanates.<br />The chemistry of reaction of isocyanates,  as evidenced by MDI,\u00a0 in biological milieu is such that in the event of a  true exposure of small MDI doses to the mouth, reactions will commence  at once with biological macromolecules in the buccal region and will  continue along the digestive tract prior to reaching the stomach.  Reaction products will be a variety of polyureas and macromolecular  conjugates with for example mucus, proteins and cell components. <br />This  is corroborated by the results from an MDI inhalation study. Following  an inhalation exposure of rats to radiolabelled MDI, 79% of the dose was  excreted in faeces. The faecal excretion in these animals was  considered entirely due to ingestion of radioactivity from grooming and  ingestion of deposited material from the nasopharangeal region via the  mucociliary escalator, i.e. not following systemic absorption. The  faecal radioactivity was tentatively identified as mixed molecular  weight polyureas derived from MDI. Diamine was not present. Thus, for  MDI and diisocyanates in general the oral gavage dosing route is  inappropriate for toxicological studies and risk assessment. <br />It is  expected that oral gavage dosing will result in a similar outcome to  that produced by TDI or MDI, that is (1) reaction with stomach contents  and (2) polymerization to solid polyureas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reaction with  stomach contents is very plausibly described in case reports of  accidental ingestion of polymeric MDI based glue in domestic animals.  Extensive polymerization and CO2 liberation resulting in an expansion of  the gastric content is described in the stomach, without apparent acute  chemical toxicity </li>\n<li>Polyurea formation in organic and aqueous  phases has been described. In this generally accepted chemistry of  hydrolysis of an isocyanate the initially produced carbamate  decarboxylates to an amine which. The amine, as a reactive intermediate,  then reacts very readily with the present isocyanate to produce a solid  and inert polyurea. This urea formation acts as a pH buffer in the  stomach, thus promoting transformation of\u00a0 the diisocyanate into  polyurea, even under the acidic conditions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the  resorbtive tissues in the small intestine, these high molecular reaction  products are likely to be of very low bioavailability, which is  substantiated by the absence of systemic toxicity in acute oral  bioassays with rats at the OECD limit dose (LC50&gt;2 g/kg bw).<br />The  respiratory tract may be regarded as the main entry for systemically  available isocyanates as evidenced following MDI.exposures. <br />A  detailed summary on urinary, plasma and in vitro metabolite studies is  provided below. Taken together, all available studies provide convincing  evidence that MDI-protein adduct and MDI-metabolite formation proceeds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>via formation of a labile isocyanate glutathione (GSH)-adduct, </li>\n<li>then transfer to a more stable adduct with larger proteins, and </li>\n<li>without  formation of free MDA. MDA reported as a metabolite is actually formed  by analytical workup procedures (strong acid or base hydrolysis) and is  not an identified metabolite in urine or blood</li>\n</ul> <p>Isocyanate vapours/mists are irritating to the upper respiratory tract and lungs; the response may be severe enough to produce bronchitis with wheezing, gasping and severe distress, even sudden loss of consciousness, and pulmonary oedema. Possible neurological symptoms arising from isocyanate exposure include headache, insomnia, euphoria, ataxia, anxiety neurosis, depression and paranoia. Gastrointestinal disturbances are characterised by nausea and vomiting. Pulmonary sensitisation may produce asthmatic reactions ranging from minor breathing difficulties to severe allergic attacks; this may occur following a single acute exposure or may develop without warning after a period of tolerance. A respiratory response may occur following minor skin contact. Skin sensitisation is possible and may result in allergic dermatitis responses including rash, itching, hives and swelling of extremities.</p> <p>\u00a0Isocyanate-containing vapours/ mists may cause inflammation of eyes and nasal passages.</p> <p>Onset of symptoms may be immediate or delayed for several hours after exposure. Sensitised people can react to very low levels of airborne isocyanates. Unprotected or sensitised persons should not be allowed to work in situations allowing exposure to this material.</p>",

                "Environment": "<p>for cyclic anhydrides:</p> <p>The physicochemical properties of commercial cyclic anhydrides suggest many general similarities. Molecular weight of anhydrides within this group classifies them as low molecular weight (&lt; 500) carboxylic acid anhydrides. All have relatively high boiling points and low vapor pressures indicating that vapor concentrations would be low under ambient conditions. All of the compounds will hydrolyse rather easily in water to produce the corresponding diacid. This indicates that solubility of the hydrolysis products and resultant pH is expected to be most relevant in the assessment of potential toxicity.</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>Due to the reactive nature of the carboxylic acid anhydride group, these chemicals are expected to hydrolyze in moist soils rather than adsorb to the soil. This conclusion is based on analogy to another closely-related cyclic anhydride, phthalic anhydride (PA). By analogy to PA, the cyclic anhydrides would not be expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, adsorb to sediments, or evaporate if released into water.</p> <p>Hydrolysis is expected to be a major fate process based on an estimated half-life for PA of 1.5 minutes. Release into the atmosphere is expected to result in direct photolysis via ring addition of photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. The vapor-phase half-life of PA in the atmosphere is approximately 32 days. Limited photolysis data on HHPA suggests that it has an even shorter atmospheric half-life of about 7 days.</p> <p>Biodegradation studies following OECD guidelines (i.e.: Method 301) have been conducted on four category members:hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA), methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA), tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (THPA), and Nadic methyl anhydride (NMA). Results showed no evidence of biodegradation potential for MHHPA and THPA as measured by BOD. NMA showed no biodegradation by BOD but did show a 1 0% biodegradation as measured by total organic carbon (TOC). HHPA also exhibited slight biodegradation potential (0.6%) as measured by BOD. All four cyclic anhydrides were hydrolysed to their respective corresponding acids.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>HHPA and THPA were tested using adequate (Klimisch Criteria = 2) test methods for freshwater fish,\u00a0<i>Leuciscus idis (DIN 38412,\u00a0</i>Teil 15)\u00a0<i>Daphnia magna,\u00a0</i>(DIN 38412, Teil 1 I), and algae,\u00a0<i>Scenedesmus subspicatus,\u00a0</i>(Algenwochstums-Hemmtest nach UBA, 1984). MHHPA, HHPA and THPA showed 48- hour LC5Os in fish of &gt; 500 mg/L, 600 mg/L and 610 mg/L, respectively. THPA and HHPA showed 24- hour EC50s Of 103 and\u00a0<i>117\u00a0</i>mg/L in\u00a0<i>Daphnia,\u00a0</i>and 72-hour EC50s of 95.6 and 65.7 mg/L for algae, respectively. Under the ICCA program, MTHPA was reported to have a 96-hour LC50 of 100 mg/L (Ricefish), a 48-hour EC50 of\u00a0<i>130\u00a0</i>mg/L for\u00a0<i>Daphnia,\u00a0</i>and a 72- hour EC50 of 79 mg/L for algae. HHPA and THPA had 24- hour EC50s of 103 and\u00a0<i>117\u00a0</i>mg/L in\u00a0<i>Daphnia\u00a0</i>and 72-hour LC5Os of 95.6 and 65.7 mg/L in algae respectively. These results suggest a low order of ecotoxicity and are in agreement with similar studies indicating that phthalic anhydride also has a low order of ecotoxicity.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

                "ExposureStandards": "<p>Sensory irritants are chemicals that produce temporary and undesirable side-effects on the eyes, nose or throat. Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life. However this system is being replaced to be consistent with the European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL); this is more closely allied to that of the USA.</p> <p>OSHA (USA) concluded that exposure to sensory irritants can:</p> <ul> <li>cause inflammation\u00a0</li> <li>cause increased susceptibility to other irritants and infectious agents\u00a0</li> <li>lead to permanent injury or dysfunction\u00a0</li> <li>permit greater absorption of hazardous substances and\u00a0</li> <li>acclimate the worker to the irritant warning properties of these substances thus increasing the risk of overexposure.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p><br /></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted, accordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations, producing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or more when extraction systems are installed or used.</p>",

                "Use": "<p>Phenolic benzotriazoles are a class of ultraviolet-light absorbers  and are used as UV stabilisers since they can absorb the full spectrum  of UV light: UV-A (320-400 nm and UV-B (280-320 nm). Compounds within  this class are used in a variety of\u00a0 consumer applications including in  polymers and sunscreens. They are used in a variety of polymers  including polycarbonates, unsaturated polyesters, polystyrenes,  acrylics, polyvinyl chloride, thermoplastic polyesters and\u00a0 polyacetals  Benzotriazoles are used in dental materials.<br />Approximately 50% of  phenolic benzotriazoles produced globally are used in surface coatings.  This group of chemicals is the most important type of UV stabilisers for  automotive paints, particularly clearcoats, due to their resistance to  photodegradation. They are also used in furniture treatments, such as  varnishes, and adhesives and sealants.<br />Approximately 40% of all  products of this substance class are used as UV-protection agents for  plastics, rubber and polyurethanes. They are added to polyethylene  terephthalate (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) . These plastics are  used to make a wide range of products, from disposable drink bottles  through to toys for children and building materials.,<br />The remaining production volume is used in cosmetics (e.g. as sun protection agents and/or preservatives)<br />Besides the benzophenone family they are technically the most important UV-absorbers, especially for transparent plastics.<br />The  different phenolic benzotriazoles have different substitution patterns  in ortho-\u00a0 and para- positions to the hydroxy group of the phenolic  ring. This difference has effects on the solubility and the distinct  colouration in different transparent plastic materials.<br />Phenolic\u00a0  benzotriazoles are mainly\u00a0 used as UV-absorbers This means that on the  molecular level UV-radiation excites\u00a0 the\u00a0 phenolic\u00a0 benzotriazole. In  this excited state a proton from the OH-group is transferred to a  nitrogen atom. From this\u00a0 structure a radiationless deactivation coupled  with another proton transfer from the nitrogen back to the OH-group  will bring\u00a0 the molecule back into its ground\u00a0 state.\u00a0 The UV-protection  properties are based on this fully reversible and\u00a0 non-destructive\u00a0  process Therefore photolysis can be regarded as a negligible degradation  path.<br />The benzotriazoles have long been an important class of UV  absorbers and have gained wide commercial importance and acceptance for  many industrial applications. So-called red-shifted benzotriazoles are  desirable for spectral reasons. Certain of these benzotriazoles are  substituted in the 3-position of the phenyl ring with an alpha-cumyl  group and at the 5-position of the benzo ring by thio ethers,  alkylsulfonyl or phenylsulfonyl moieties. When such sulfonyl  substituents are combined with specifically alpha-cumyl moieties,  extremely durable compounds result which, due to the bulk of the  alpha-cumyl moiety have sufficiently low volatility to be useful in  coating and other polymer system.<br /><br />At\u00a0 least\u00a0 some\u00a0 of these\u00a0 substances\u00a0 appear\u00a0 to\u00a0 have\u00a0 similar\u00a0 PBT/vPvB-properties.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Benzotriazoles, bicyclic heterocyclic systems containing three\r\nnitrogen atoms and a fused benzene ring, show a wide range of biological and\r\npharmacological activities as well as applications in materials science.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Benzotriazoles are used in industry as fixing agents in\r\nphotographic emulsions, as anti-tarnish agents for copper and its alloys, as a\r\ncorrosion inhibitor, and in antifreeze and water coolant systems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Benzotriazole (BTA) has been commonly employed as a leaving group\r\nand has been used extensively as a novel synthetic auxiliary.

Benzotriazoles as a class may interact with the P-450s. The P450s are important both for detoxifying a broad range of xenobiotics and for activating many compounds to carcinogens in mammalian systems. Benzotriazoles are recalcitrant molecules used as corrosion inhibitors in antifreeze and deicing formulations. Existing data for members of this category indicate that they are of low concern for mammalian toxicity, will partition to soil and water. Benzotriazoles have high stabilities both at high temperatures and in presence of UV light. These compounds present an environmental problem due to their toxicity to microorganisms and plants. Until now, there have not been reports revealing ways for treating waste streams containing benzotriazoles by conventional methods, due to the lack of microorganisms that can degrade most benzotriazoles. No evidence for anaerobic degradation of benzotriazole and its derivatives was observed for both batch and continuously fed anaerobic systems. Benzotriazoles show toxicity to anaerobic microbes at fairly low concentrations. Acute toxic responses to benzotriazoles have been observed in MlCROTOX'M assays at concentrations less than 10 mg/L Aquatic organisms are known to be sensitive to low levels of benzotriazoles, for instance for fish, LC50 is around 30 mg/L.</p> <p>Benzotriazoles are nitrification inhibitors. Much fertilizer N applied to soils is in the form of ammonium or ammonium-producing compounds such as urea, and is usually oxidised quite rapidly to nitrate by nitrifying microorganisms in soil.</p> <p>Benzotriazole has a toxic effect on plants. Several reports cited in an EPA (1977) document indicated that benzotriazole can produce distinct morphological changes in a variety of plants.\u00a0Tomato plants were shown to be sensitive to both benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole. Benzotriazole has a structure that resembles auxin, which may account for its toxicity to plants. It may also be an analog of purines and indoles. Plant roots interact with organic pollutants and some of these contaminants can be phytotransformed. Root uptake of 1-H-benzotriazole and its derivatives, tolyltriazole, 5-methyl benzotriazole, and 1-hydroxy benzotriazole was studied. At levels below the toxic threshold of about 100 mg/L, triazoles appear to be incorporated into plant tissue. Plants actively take up the triazoles at a rate greater than predicted by transpiration stream-concentration factor and plant-water uptake.</p> <p>Benzotriazoles have been observed to be readily degraded by a Fenton reaction in the presence of peroxide and iron. Certain fungi produce lignin peroxidase (Phanerochaete chrysosporium for example) and have been shown to degrade benzotriazoles.</p> <p><span style=\"color:black\">for UV filters:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">UV filters have been detected in surface water, wastewater and\r\nfish, and some of them are estrogenic in fish. At present, little is known\r\nabout their additional hormonal activities in different hormonal receptor\r\nsystems despite their increasing use and environmental persistence. Besides\r\nestrogenic activity, UV filters may have additional activities, both agonistic\r\nand antagonistic in aquatic organisms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Systematic analysis of the oestrogenic, antioestrogenic,\r\nandrogenic, and antiandrogenic activity was conducted using 18 UV filters and\r\none metabolite\u00a0<i>in vitro</i>\u00a0at non-cytotoxic concentrations with\r\nrecombinant yeast systems carrying either a human estrogen (hER) or androgen\r\nreceptor (hAR). All 19 compounds elicited hormonal activities, surprisingly\r\nmost of them multiple activities. Ten UV-filters having agonistic effects\r\ntowards the hER. Surprisingly, six UV filters with androgenic activities and\r\nmany of them having pronounced antioestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities.\r\nSeventeen compounds inhibited 4,5-dihydrotestosterone activity in the hAR\r\nassay, while 14 compounds inhibited oestradiol activity in the hER assay,\r\nindicating antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, respectively. In\r\nparticular, the antiandrogenic activities of phenyl- and benzyl salicylate,\r\nbenzophenone-1 and -2, and of 4-hydroxybenzophenone were higher than that of\r\nflutamide, a known hAR antagonist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Although most of the UV filters exert hormonal effects at\r\nconcentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in the environment,\r\nwide distribution and exposure to UV filter mixtures may have environmental\r\nconsequences due to additive effects. The UV filters 4-methylbenzylidene\r\ncamphor, benzophenone-3, \u00a0benzophenone-4, octyl methoxycinnamate,\r\noctocrylene and homosalate that repeatedly were detected in the aquatic\r\nenvironment, may contribute with their multiple hormonal activities in a\r\ncomplex manner to the mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals already present\r\nin surface water and fish. For most of the UV filters with multiple hormonal\r\nactivities residues in the aquatic environment and in biota are not yet known,\r\nand therefore their environmental relevance remains elusive. The fact that all\r\n18 UV filters and one metabolite showed receptor ligand binding via\r\ntransactivation \u2013 surprisingly most of them multiple bindings \u2013 reveals a\r\ncomplex picture of the hormonal activities of UV filters</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Petra Kunz and Karl Fent: Aquatic Toxicology Vol 79 pp 305-324\r\nOctober 2006</span></p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness.

Health surveillance is appropriate for all\r\nemployees exposed or liable to be exposed to a substance which may\u00a0 cause\r\noccupational asthma and there should be appropriate consultation with an\r\noccupational health professional over the degree of risk and level of\r\nsurveillance.</span></p> <p>On the basis, primarily, of animal experiments, concern has been expressed by at least one classification body that the material may produce carcinogenic or mutagenic effects; in respect of the available information, however, there presently exists inadequate data for making a satisfactory assessment.</p><p><span style=\"color:black\">Speculative discussion surrounds\r\nthe use of sunscreens and a possible rise in the incidence of melanoma. One\r\nmechanism proposed involves the development of free radicals following UVB\r\nabsorption by the chemical agent; free radicals are potentially damaging to\r\nDNA.\u00a0 A further mechanism involves the inhibition of Vitamin D production; low\r\nlevels of Vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of the development\r\nof breast and colon cancer and may also accelerate the growth of melanoma.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While sunscreens have been\r\neffective in protecting against a variety of UV-related pathologies, such as\r\nsunburns, actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas\u00a0 growing\r\npopularity and thus, possibility for exposure questions their safety in\r\nenvironment and human health. Available data imply, that sunscreen compounds\r\nmight block vitamin D synthesis or act as endocrine disruptor and lead to\r\ndevelopmental toxicity. The effects of sunscreen on cutaneous synthesis of\r\nvitamin D induced by sunlight have been a subject of debate, however the newest\r\nanalysis suggests, that normal usage of sunscreen by adults do not decrease\r\ncutaneous synthesis of vitamin D . The endocrine disruptive and developmental\r\ntoxicity of many organic UV filters in experimental models is well established,\r\nthese filters seem to be associated with altered estrogen, androgen and\r\nprogesterone activity, reproductive and developmental toxicity and impaired\r\nfunctioning of the thyroid, liver or kidneys, reviewed elsewhere.\u00a0 Since many\r\nof UV filters were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the risk for\r\nneurotoxicity also occurs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Organic or chemical filters are\r\nthe most popular and widely used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.\r\nOrganic filters can be classified by the type of ultraviolet (UV) radiation\r\nthey absorb, namely UVB, UVA or UVB-UVA filters. The main route of human\r\nexposure is dermal absorption, however other routes and environmental exposure\r\nshould be also considered. The last is particularly true for organic filters,\r\nwhich, due to their high lipophilicity could bioaccumulate in aquatic organism\r\nand reach humans through the food chain. Thus, they also are emergent as an\r\nenvironmental pollutant. Chemical UV filters are easily absorbed by the skin\r\nand reach the systemic circulation, and accumulate in various tissues, as\r\nadipose tissue, liver and the brain. Their lipophilicity permits them to\r\nreadily cross the BBB. There is a wide range of in vitro and in vivo studies of\r\nthe toxic effects of UV filters as endocrine disruptors. Since it is known that\r\nother chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors can impair neuronal\r\ntransmission, synaptic plasticity and produce neurotoxic effects [ chemical\r\nfilters might potentially produce similar effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Inorganic (physical) ingredients\r\nused in modern sunscreens include metal oxide particles, typically titanium\r\ndioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), which occurs typically at 5-10%\r\nconcentration (maximum allowed is 25%). While chemical filters still dominate\r\nin sunscreen products, the usage of physical compounds is constantly growing.\r\nOne of the reasons is that they have a higher spectrum of protection - TiO2 is\r\nvery effective in absorbing UVB, while ZnO absorbs mainly the UVA range, and\r\nthe combination of both particles provides a broad UV protection. Other\r\nadvantages of physical filters are lack of skin sensitization and limited skin\r\npenetration. However, these mineral filters, when in normal pigment size range\r\n(200-400 nm for ZnO, 150-300 nm for TiO2) have poor particle dispersion, which\r\nmakes them difficult to apply; they also reflect and scatter light, which\r\nresult in undesirable visible white film on the skin. With nanotechnology,\r\nthese materials can be reduced to nanoparticles (NPs) (&lt;100 nm) which are\r\neasier to apply and are transparent on the skin . Nevertheless, with\r\nmicronization some properties are changed - they may be more bioreactive and\r\neasier penetrate the skin and other tissues, leading to concerns about their\r\nsafety use. Moreover, part of the absorbed UV radiation can generate free\r\nradicals on the surface of metal oxides in the presence of water and this\r\nphotocatalytic activity increases with decreasing NPs size. NP-induced cyto-\r\nand genotoxicity has been associated with increased photocatalytic activity,\r\nleading to increased production of free radicals</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>",
