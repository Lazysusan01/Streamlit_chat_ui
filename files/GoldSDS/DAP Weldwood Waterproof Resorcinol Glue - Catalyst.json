Only weak explosions are\r\nlikely where the mean particle size exceeds 200 microns. Wood dust is\r\nconsidered to be explosive if ignition of part of a cloud of wood dust results\r\nin the propagation of flame through the rest of the cloud. The vigour of flame\r\npropagation will vary from dust cloud to dust cloud and not all flammable dusts\r\nare equally explosive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">The burning of an unconfined wood dust cloud produces a flash\r\nfire. However, if the wood dust is contained within a full or partial\r\nenclosure, the pressure build-up can produce a destructive explosion. Its\r\nseverity will depend on the type and concentration of the dust, particle size\r\ndistribution, moisture content, the size of the source of ignition and the\r\nstrength of the enclosure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Generally, the larger the volume of the exploding dust cloud, the\r\nmore widespread its effects will be. It is important to ensure that wood dust\r\ndoes not escape from collection systems and be allowed to build up within\r\nworkrooms. If dust does accumulate, any primary explosion which occurs in a\r\ncollection unit may stir up dust deposits within the building which houses the\r\nplant. Burning particles from the primary explosion can ignite the dust cloud\r\nresulting from it, leading to a secondary explosion that is usually more\r\ndestructive than the first.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Mechanical or abrasive activities which produce wood dust, as a\r\nby-product, may present a severe explosion hazard if a dust cloud contacts an\r\nignition source. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Hot humid conditions may result in <b><i>spontaneous combustion</i></b>\r\nof accumulated wood dust.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Partially burned or scorched wood dust can explode if dispersed in\r\nair.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Wet dusts may ignite spontaneously.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Solid fuels, such as wood, when subjected to a sufficient heat\r\nflux, will degrade, gasify and release vapours.

Wood is an organic substrate for growth of micro-organisms\r\nand fungal spores, these readily become airborne with wood dust and have caused\r\na variety of respiratory infections Various woods, mainly tropical varieties,\r\nare able to induce allergies in joiners, carpenters, cabinet makers and model-makers.\r\nAllergies of the immediate type (rhino conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma,\r\nurticaria), caused by contact with dusts produced during wood-working and those\r\nof a delayed type (contact eczema) caused by both the dust and by direct\r\ncontact with the solid wood, are seen in an occupational setting. Because of\r\nthe large number of substances found in wood, only a few low molecular weight\r\nallergens have been isolated and identified; these are mostly quinone or\r\nflavone derivatives. Many of the constituents of wood may also cause primary\r\nirritation. Irritation of the skin, eyes and respiratory passages are often\r\ndistinguished from allergic responses with difficulty. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The use of skin tests with wood\r\ndusts to confirm suspected allergy must be viewed as suspect because the high\r\nconcentration of wood components which are sometimes applied, can actually\r\nproduce new sensitisation in test subjects. It should also be noted that\r\ncross-reactions or reactions to groups of similar substances, in other woods\r\nand also in other herbaceous plants can also occur. The substances in wood\r\nresponsible for respiratory allergies are probably mostly high molecular weight\r\nsubstances. Wood dusts may induce asthmatic reactions of both the immediate and\r\ndelayed types, and occasionally, both. Positive results in bronchial\r\nprovocation tests, are often, but not always, associated with positive results\r\nin skin tests and IgE induction. Bronchial provocation tests may produce\r\ndifferent results dependent on whether they are carried out with course or fine\r\ndusts or with lyophilised aqueous extracts. Very course dust may produce false\r\nnegatives and very fine dust may produce false positives (irritation).\r\nNon-allergenic bronchial and nasal irritation are seen frequently. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Certain exotic woods contain alkaloids\r\nwhich may produce headache, anorexia, nausea, bradycardia and dyspnea. Agents\r\nused to treat wood (preservatives, fungicides, stains, glues, pore fillers) may\r\nthemselves be responsible for allergic reaction. Other allergic reactions may\r\nbe provoked by liverworts (\"Frullania dermatitis\"), lichens, fungi\r\n(e.g. bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), actinomycetes or other plants which grow\r\non wood. Microorganisms and fungal spores, associated with wood, may become\r\nairborne and provoke allergic responses. Other chronic responses associated\r\nwith exposure to wood dusts include conjunctivitis, simple bronchitis and\r\nnon-asthmatic chronic airflow obstruction. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Epidemiologic studies in\r\nfurniture workers show an increased risk of lung, tongue, pharynx and nasal\r\ncancer (adenocarcinoma). Workers in timber industries, with a history of\r\nexposure to wood dust, have shown increased occurrence of lung, liver and vocal\r\ncavity cancer. An excess risk of leukaemia amongst mill-wrights probably is\r\nassociated with various components used in wood preservation. It is now\r\nsuggested that sinonasal cancers may be caused by both hardwoods and softwoods\r\n(1). The causative agent or agents are unknown although certain aldehydes or\r\ntheir quinone oxidation products have been implicated. Exposure standards for\r\nthe softwoods reflect the apparent low risk for upper respiratory tract\r\ninvolvement among workers in the building industry. A significantly lower\r\nexposure standard for hardwoods is based on impaired nasal mucociliary\r\nhyperplasia reported to contribute to nasal adenocarcinoma and related\r\nhyperplasia in furniture workers. Exposure standards for both hard and\r\nsoftwoods specifically exclude the issue of occupational asthma and related\r\nallergic respiratory response associated with exposure to red cedar dusts and\r\nsimilar woods.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The main components of wood are\r\npolysaccharides: cellulose (40-50 wt%) and hemicelluloses (20\u201335%), while\r\nlignin comprises 15\u201330% of wood mass.3 In addition to these macromolecules,\r\nwood contains a small amount of inorganic residues and extractives, which are\r\nlow molar mass molecules. Extractives include a heterogeneous group of\r\naliphatic and cyclic compounds: terpenes and terpenoids, esters of fatty acids,\r\nfatty acids, alcohols, alkanes, simple phenols, stilbenes, lignans, isoflavones,\r\ncondensed tannins, flavonoids and hydrolyzable tannins. Wood phenolic compounds\r\nmay possess bioactive functions; in vitro studies suggest that they may act as\r\nantioxidants. Due to the close association of lignin and extractives with\r\ncellulose and hemicelluloses, low amounts of these compounds commonly exist in\r\nhemicellulose or cellulose extracts and can, thus, be considered as\r\n\u201cco-passengers\u201d of fibrous materials. While wood extracts are neither presently\r\nnor extensively used in food ingredients, they have a long history in food\r\nsupplement use. Softwood extracts have also received attention in the\r\nbiomedical field; spruce hemicellulose extract was patented for \u201cuse on the\r\ntreatment of lower urinary tract symptoms and diseases\u201d.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The presence of mycotoxins is\r\nunlikely given the production procedure (particularly as there was no\r\nsignificant delay between grinding and extraction). The possibility of fungal\r\ncontamination on the tree stumps is also unlikely since, firstly, these stumps\r\ncome from felled wood which is therefore healthy, and secondly, if a fungal\r\ncontamination were to appear (in the event that the stumps were not collected\r\nquickly after the trees were felled), this would essentially be an external\r\ncontamination which would be eliminated when the stumps were examined before\r\nthe grinding process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Radionuclide monitoring checks\r\nshould be carried out systematically for all batches</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>",

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma.

Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p> <p>Sensitisation may result in allergic dermatitis responses including rash, itching, hives or swelling of extremities.</p>|Paraformaldehyde solid and solutions, when heated evolve formaldehyde gas.",

Once the airways have become hyper-responsive,\r\nfurther exposure to the substance, sometimes even to tiny quantities, may cause\r\nrespiratory symptoms. These symptoms can range in severity from a runny nose to\r\nasthma. Not all workers who are exposed to a sensitiser will become\r\nhyper-responsive and it is impossible to identify in advance who are likely to\r\nbecome hyper-responsive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Substances than can cuase\r\noccupational asthma should be distinguished from substances which may trigger\r\nthe symptoms of asthma in people with pre-existing air-way\r\nhyper-responsiveness.

There is sufficient data to establish a causal association between human exposure to the material and the development of cancer.</p><p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>When administered by inhalation, formaldehyde induced squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal cavity in rats of both sexes. Although excess occurrence of a number of cancers has been reported in humans, the evidence for a possible involvement of formaldehyde is strongest for nasal and nasopharangeal cancer. The occurrence of these cancers showed an exposure-response gradient in more than one study, but the numbers of exposed cases were often small and some studies did not show excesses In humans. Formaldehyde exposure has been associated with cancers of the lung, nasopharynx and oropharynx and nasal passages.</p> <p>Several investigations have concluded that specific respiratory sensitisation occurs based on positive bronchial provocation tests amongst formaldehyde-exposed workers. These studies have been criticised for methodological reasons. One large study however revealed that 5% of persons exposed to formaldehyde and had asthma-like symptoms met the study criteria for formaldehyde-induced asthma; this included a positive response on a bronchial provocation test with 2.5 mg/m3 formaldehyde. Although differential individual sensitivity has been established, the mechanism for this increased sensitivity is unknown.</p> <p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde has any adverse effect on reproduction or development in humans. An investigation of reproductive function in female workers exposed to formaldehyde in the garment industry, revealed an increased incidence of menstrual disorders, inflammatory disease of the reproductive tract, sterility, anaemia, and low birth weights amongst off-spring.</p>",

Wood is an organic substrate for growth of micro-organisms\r\nand fungal spores, these readily become airborne with wood dust and have caused\r\na variety of respiratory infections Various woods, mainly tropical varieties,\r\nare able to induce allergies in joiners, carpenters, cabinet makers and model-makers.\r\nAllergies of the immediate type (rhino conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma,\r\nurticaria), caused by contact with dusts produced during wood-working and those\r\nof a delayed type (contact eczema) caused by both the dust and by direct\r\ncontact with the solid wood, are seen in an occupational setting. Because of\r\nthe large number of substances found in wood, only a few low molecular weight\r\nallergens have been isolated and identified; these are mostly quinone or\r\nflavone derivatives. Many of the constituents of wood may also cause primary\r\nirritation. Irritation of the skin, eyes and respiratory passages are often\r\ndistinguished from allergic responses with difficulty. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The use of skin tests with wood\r\ndusts to confirm suspected allergy must be viewed as suspect because the high\r\nconcentration of wood components which are sometimes applied, can actually\r\nproduce new sensitisation in test subjects. It should also be noted that\r\ncross-reactions or reactions to groups of similar substances, in other woods\r\nand also in other herbaceous plants can also occur. The substances in wood\r\nresponsible for respiratory allergies are probably mostly high molecular weight\r\nsubstances. Wood dusts may induce asthmatic reactions of both the immediate and\r\ndelayed types, and occasionally, both. Positive results in bronchial\r\nprovocation tests, are often, but not always, associated with positive results\r\nin skin tests and IgE induction. Bronchial provocation tests may produce\r\ndifferent results dependent on whether they are carried out with course or fine\r\ndusts or with lyophilised aqueous extracts. Very course dust may produce false\r\nnegatives and very fine dust may produce false positives (irritation).\r\nNon-allergenic bronchial and nasal irritation are seen frequently. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Certain exotic woods contain alkaloids\r\nwhich may produce headache, anorexia, nausea, bradycardia and dyspnea. Agents\r\nused to treat wood (preservatives, fungicides, stains, glues, pore fillers) may\r\nthemselves be responsible for allergic reaction. Other allergic reactions may\r\nbe provoked by liverworts (\"Frullania dermatitis\"), lichens, fungi\r\n(e.g. bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), actinomycetes or other plants which grow\r\non wood. Microorganisms and fungal spores, associated with wood, may become\r\nairborne and provoke allergic responses. Other chronic responses associated\r\nwith exposure to wood dusts include conjunctivitis, simple bronchitis and\r\nnon-asthmatic chronic airflow obstruction. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Epidemiologic studies in\r\nfurniture workers show an increased risk of lung, tongue, pharynx and nasal\r\ncancer (adenocarcinoma). Workers in timber industries, with a history of\r\nexposure to wood dust, have shown increased occurrence of lung, liver and vocal\r\ncavity cancer. An excess risk of leukaemia amongst mill-wrights probably is\r\nassociated with various components used in wood preservation. It is now\r\nsuggested that sinonasal cancers may be caused by both hardwoods and softwoods\r\n(1). The causative agent or agents are unknown although certain aldehydes or\r\ntheir quinone oxidation products have been implicated. Exposure standards for\r\nthe softwoods reflect the apparent low risk for upper respiratory tract\r\ninvolvement among workers in the building industry. A significantly lower\r\nexposure standard for hardwoods is based on impaired nasal mucociliary\r\nhyperplasia reported to contribute to nasal adenocarcinoma and related\r\nhyperplasia in furniture workers. Exposure standards for both hard and\r\nsoftwoods specifically exclude the issue of occupational asthma and related\r\nallergic respiratory response associated with exposure to red cedar dusts and\r\nsimilar woods.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The main components of wood are\r\npolysaccharides: cellulose (40-50 wt%) and hemicelluloses (20\u201335%), while\r\nlignin comprises 15\u201330% of wood mass.3 In addition to these macromolecules,\r\nwood contains a small amount of inorganic residues and extractives, which are\r\nlow molar mass molecules. Extractives include a heterogeneous group of\r\naliphatic and cyclic compounds: terpenes and terpenoids, esters of fatty acids,\r\nfatty acids, alcohols, alkanes, simple phenols, stilbenes, lignans, isoflavones,\r\ncondensed tannins, flavonoids and hydrolyzable tannins. Wood phenolic compounds\r\nmay possess bioactive functions; in vitro studies suggest that they may act as\r\nantioxidants. Due to the close association of lignin and extractives with\r\ncellulose and hemicelluloses, low amounts of these compounds commonly exist in\r\nhemicellulose or cellulose extracts and can, thus, be considered as\r\n\u201cco-passengers\u201d of fibrous materials. While wood extracts are neither presently\r\nnor extensively used in food ingredients, they have a long history in food\r\nsupplement use. Softwood extracts have also received attention in the\r\nbiomedical field; spruce hemicellulose extract was patented for \u201cuse on the\r\ntreatment of lower urinary tract symptoms and diseases\u201d.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The presence of mycotoxins is\r\nunlikely given the production procedure (particularly as there was no\r\nsignificant delay between grinding and extraction). The possibility of fungal\r\ncontamination on the tree stumps is also unlikely since, firstly, these stumps\r\ncome from felled wood which is therefore healthy, and secondly, if a fungal\r\ncontamination were to appear (in the event that the stumps were not collected\r\nquickly after the trees were felled), this would essentially be an external\r\ncontamination which would be eliminated when the stumps were examined before\r\nthe grinding process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Radionuclide monitoring checks\r\nshould be carried out systematically for all batches</span><span style=\"color:black\">.</span></p>",
