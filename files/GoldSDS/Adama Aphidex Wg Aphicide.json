Dust clouds generated by the fine grinding of the solid are a particular hazard; accumulations of fine dust (420 micron or less) may burn rapidly and fiercely if ignited - particles exceeding this limit will generally not form flammable dust clouds; once initiated, however, larger particles up to 1400 microns diameter will contribute to the propagation of an explosion. </li>\n<li>In the same way as gases and vapours, dusts in the form of a cloud are only ignitable over a range of concentrations; in principle, the concepts of lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are applicable to dust clouds but only the LEL is of practical use; - this is because of the inherent difficulty of achieving homogeneous dust clouds at high temperatures (for dusts the LEL is often called the \"Minimum Explosible Concentration\", MEC). </li>\n<li>When processed with flammable liquids/vapors/mists,ignitable (hybrid) mixtures may be formed with combustible dusts. Ignitable mixtures will increase the rate of explosion pressure rise and the Minimum Ignition Energy (the minimum amount of energy required to ignite dust clouds - MIE) will be lower than the pure dust in air mixture.

Only rarely are carbamates found in crops beyond the growing season during which they are applied. Chemical or photochemical mechanisms may produce a cleaving group which is easily degraded. As a rule these compounds do not represent a serious problem as contaminants of soil and water. Breakdown products are usually non-toxic being composed of low-molecular weight, volatile molecules that are easily degraded and utilised by micro-organisms. Being esters they are also susceptible to hydrolysis. Most carbamate pesticides are stable to acid pHs but under alkaline conditions hydrolysis is rapid with the breakdown rate increasing 10-fold for each pH unit above 7. An increase of 10 deg. C of temperature will increase the hydrolysis rate approximately 4-fold. When these compounds are present in the soil their disappearance is affected by their interaction with the physical characteristics and water content of the soil, and the microflora present. In certain types of soil strong binding may make them unavailable for biological decomposition. In such soils even running water produces little movement and thus minimal contamination of water supplies. Less tightly bound substances are similarly unlikely to produce substantial contamination because of rapid breakdown. In general only minute amounts of pesticide residue and their breakdown products are found in natural water systems. In soil however there is a greater likelihood of the presence and buildup of toxic residues.</p> <p>A large number of studies on the absorption and translocation of carbamate herbicides have been carried out to study the fate of these compounds in plants. The results suggest that plant leaf surfaces are a barrier to the absorption of carbamates. Roots, however, absorb the herbicides to a much greater extent, and the carbamate moves to all plant parts. Thus, it is suggested that carbamates are exclusively distributed via the apoplastic system. The carrier that is used plays an important role in these absorption studies. Many studies are available concerning the actual entry of carbamates into the plant, their hydrolysis, aromatic ring hydroxylation, hydrolytic breakdown, and oxidation of aliphatic groups.\u00a0</p> <p>Carbamates are metabolised or broken down in soil, plants, and animals. The questions of the environmental impact and the significance of the metabolites with respect to persistence and bioaccumulation in certain species and in the food chain have still to be answered. Although carbamates are not very stable under aquatic conditions, and will not persist long in this environment, some bioaccumulate in fish, mainly because the metabolism is slow in fish. Other carbamates are metabolised rapidly and no accumulation occurs.</p> <p>It appears that most, if not all, of the known carbamate metabolites are biodegraded rapidly and are less toxic for the environment than the parent molecules. Soil microorganisms are capable of metabolising (hydrolysing) carbamates and can easily adapt themselves to metabolize the different types of carbamates. Nevertheless, carbamates and their metabolites can, at high dose levels, affect the microflora and cause changes that may be of importance in soil productivity.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Some carbamates are highly toxic for invertebrates and fish, others much less so. In certain cases, the use of toxic carbamates may cause a significant reduction in non-target organisms. Carbamates are toxic for worms and other organisms living in the soil. Although a great reduction in the earthworm population may occur when applying carbamates to the soil, numbers will return to normal, because of the rather rapid breakdown of these compounds.</p> <p>In general, the toxicity of carbamates for wildlife is low, but exceptions exist. This means that, in order to judge the impact of carbamates on the organisms in the environment, the information on the individual carbamates should be referred to. As a rule, birds are not very sensitive to carbamates while bees are extremely sensitive.\u00a0</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p> <p>The material is classified as an\u00a0<b>ecotoxin*</b>\u00a0because the\u00a0<b><i>Daphnia EC50 (48 hours)\u00a0</i></b>is less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l</p> <p><br /></p> <p><i>* Classification of Substances as Ecotoxic (Dangerous to the Environment)</i></p> <p><i>\u00a0 Appendix 8, Table 1</i></p> <p><i>Compiler's Guide for the Preparation of International Chemical Safety Cards: 1993 Commission of the European Communities</i></p>|Kow log P = 1.7|Ecotoxicology:|Birds: Acute Oral LD50 for poultry 25-50, mallard ducks 17.2,|bobwhite quail 8.2 mg/kg|Fish LC50 (96 h) for rainbow trout 29, bluegill sunfish 55 mg/lg|Bees: Not toxic to bees and beneficial insects|Daphnia EC50 (24 h) 0.08 ppm|Environmental Fate:|Soil and Water:|DT50 in soil 7-234 d depending on soil type (range o.m. 1.7-51.9, pH 5.5-8.1)",

Historically occupational exposure standards for these irritants have been based on observation of workers' responses to various airborne concentrations. Present day expectations require that nearly every individual should be protected against even minor sensory irritation and exposure standards are established using uncertainty factors or safety factors of 5 to 10 or more. On occasion animal no-observable-effect-levels (NOEL) are used to determine these limits where human results are unavailable. An additional approach, typically used by the TLV committee (USA) in determining respiratory standards for this group of chemicals, has been to assign ceiling values (TLV C) to rapidly acting irritants and to assign short-term exposure limits (TLV STELs) when the weight of evidence from irritation, bioaccumulation and other endpoints combine to warrant such a limit. In contrast the MAK Commission (Germany) uses a five-category system based on intensive odour, local irritation, and elimination half-life.

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 4-10 m/s (800-2000 f/min) for extraction of crusher dusts generated 2 metres distant from the extraction point.

Fatalities in man are generally due to respiratory failure on the basis of central nervous system paralysis although cardiac arrest may also occur. Where cholinesterase inhibitors have been used as miotic eyedrops there has occasional evidence of toxic effects on the crystalline lens and obstruction of the nasolachrymal canals.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal;text-autospace:none'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;\r\nfont-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Although signs and symptoms of\r\ncarbamate ester poisoning are almost identical to those produced by\r\norganophosphorus pesticides, there are significant differences. For example,\r\ncarbamate doses resulting in early toxic symptoms are widely separated from\r\ndoses resulting in mortality. This is the result of differences between the\r\nbinding properties of organo-phosphates and carbamates to acetylcholinesterase.\r\nAlso in contrast to the organophosphates, recovery from carbamate poisoning is\r\nrapid, due to the significantly increased rate of reactivation of\r\nacetylcholinesterase.</span></p>",
                "AcuteEye": "<p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests, that the material may cause eye irritation in a substantial number of individuals. Repeated or prolonged eye contact may cause inflammation characterised by temporary redness (similar to windburn) of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis); temporary impairment of vision and/or other transient eye damage/ulceration may occur.</p> <p>Direct contact with the eyes may produce lachrymation (tears), twitching of the eyelids, miosis (contraction of the pupils) and ciliary muscle spasm mydriasis (dilation of the pupils). Absorption may produce generalised cholinesterase inhibition.</p>",
                "AcuteSkin": "<p>The material is not thought to be a skin irritant (as classified by EC Directives using animal models). Abrasive damage however, may result from prolonged exposures. Good hygiene practice requires that exposure be kept to a minimum and that suitable gloves be used in an occupational setting.</p> <p>Skin contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption.</p> <p>Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material</p> <p>Entry into the blood-stream through, for example, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected.</p> <p>Localised sweating and fasciculation (small localised muscular contractions visible through the skin) may occur at sites of contact. Absorption may produce cholinesterase inhibition effects following delays of up to 2-3 hours (but generally not more than 12 hours).</p>",
                "AcuteIngestion": "<p>Toxic effects may result from the accidental ingestion of the material; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 40 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence exists that the substance may cause irreversible but non-lethal mutagenic effects following a single exposure.</p> <p>Ingestion may produce nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal cramps, and diarrhoea. Generalised symptoms produced by cholinesterase inhibitors may ensue following appreciable absorption.\u00a0</p> <p>Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure which may or may not have produced immediate symptoms. In such cases, numbness, tingling, weakness, and cramping may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, and in some cases residual impairment will remain\u00a0</p>",
                "ChronicHealthEffects": "<p>Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems.</p> <p>Exposure to the material may result in a possible risk of irreversible effects. The material may produce mutagenic effects in man. This concern is raised, generally, on the basis of</p> <p>appropriate studies with similar materials using mammalian somatic cells in vivo. Such findings are often supported by positive results from in vitro mutagenicity studies.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Long term exposure to high dust concentrations may cause changes in lung function (i.e. pneumoconiosis) caused by particles less than 0.5 micron penetrating and remaining in the lung. A prime symptom is breathlessness. Lung shadows show on X-ray.</p> <p>Repeated or prolonged exposures to cholinesterase inhibitors produce symptoms similar to acute effects. In addition workers exposed repeatedly to these substances may exhibit impaired memory and loss of concentration, severe depression and acute psychosis, irritability, confusion, apathy, emotional lability, speech difficulties, headache, spatial disorientation, delayed reaction times, sleepwalking, drowsiness or insomnia. An influenza-like condition with nausea, weakness, anorexia and malaise has been described. There is a growing body of evidence from epidemiological studies and from experimental laboratory studies that short-term exposure to some cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides may produce behavioural or neuro-chemical changes lasting for days or months, presumably outlasting the cholinesterase inhibition. Although the number of adverse effects following humans poisonings subsides, there are still effects in some workers months after cholinesterase activity returns to normal. These long-lasting effects include blurred vision, headache, weakness, and anorexia. The neurochemistry of animals exposed to chlorpyrifos or fenthion is reported to be altered permanently after a single exposure. These effects may be more severe in developing animals where both acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase may play an integral part in the development of the nervous system.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><i>Padilla S., The Neurotoxicity of Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Insecticides: Past and Present Evidence Demonstrating Persistent Effects.

A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task.

Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable.

Microbiological processes may also transform insoluble metals to more soluble forms. Such ionic species may bind to dissolved ligands or sorb to solid particles in aquatic or aqueous media. A significant proportion of dissolved/ sorbed metals will end up in sediments through the settling of suspended particles. The remaining metal ions can then be taken up by aquatic organisms.</p> <p>When released to dry soil most metals will exhibit limited mobility and remain in the upper layer; some will leach locally into ground water and/ or surface water ecosystems when soaked by rain or melt ice.
