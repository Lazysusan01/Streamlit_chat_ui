Biodegradation of n-heptane may occur in soil and water, however volatilisation and adsorption are expected to be more important fate processes. A high Koc (2400-8200) indicates n-heptane will be slightly mobile to immobile in soil. In aquatic systems n-heptane may partition from the water column to organic matter in sediments and suspended solids. The bioconcentration of n-heptane may be important in aquatic environments. the Henry's Law constant suggests rapid volatilisation from environmental waters and surface soils. The volatilisation half-lives from a model river and a model pond (the latter considers the effect of adsorption) have been estimated to be 2.9 hr and 13 days, respectively.</p> <p>n-Heptane is expected to exist entirely in the vapour phase in ambient air. Reactions with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere have been shown to be important (estimated half-life of 2.4 days calculated from its rate constant of 7.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C). Data also suggests that night-time reactions with nitrate radicals may contribute to the atmospheric transformation of n-heptane, especially in urban environments. n-Heptane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight</p> <p>An estimated BCF of 2,000 using \u00a0log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Based on 100% degradation after 4 days in water inoculated with gasoline contaminated soil and 100% degradation after 25 days in water inoculated with activated sewage sludge, biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for n-heptane in water.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity</b>:</p> <p>Fish LC50 (48 h): goldfish (Carrasius auratus) 4 mg/l; golden orfe (Idus melanotus) 2940 mg/l; western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) 4924 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia LC50 (24 h): &gt;10 mg/l</p> <p>Daphnia EC50 (96 h): 82 mg/l (immobilisation)</p> <p>Opposum shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia) LC50 (96 h): 0.1 mg/l</p> <p>Snail EC50 (96 h): 472 mg/l</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases).

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min.) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly.

Polyolefin degrees of crystallinity range\r\nfrom 0% (liquid-like) to 60% or higher (rigid plastics).

These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous\r\nconformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align\r\nthemselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact\r\nsurface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular\r\ninteractions between molecules.

In one study, the experimentally measured vapour pressure of a solvent-dewaxed heavy paraffinic distillate base oil was 1.7 x 10exp-4 Pa . Since base oils are mixtures of C15 to C50 paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbon isomers, representative components of those structures were selected to calculate a range of vapor pressures. The estimated vapor pressure values for these selected components of base oils ranged from 4.5 x 10exp-1 Pa to 2 x 10exp-13Pa. Based on Dalton's Law the expected total vapour pressure for base oils would fall well below minimum levels (10exp-5 Pa) of recommended experimental procedures.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Partition Coefficient (log Kow):\u00a0</b>In mixtures such as the base oils, the percent distribution of the hydrocarbon groups (i.e., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and the carbon chain lengths determines in-part the partitioning characteristics of the mixture. Generally, hydrocarbon chains with fewer carbon atoms tend to have lower partition coefficients than those with higher carbon numbers .However, due to their complex composition, unequivocal determination of the log Kow of these hydrocarbon mixtures cannot be made. Rather, partition coefficients of selected C15 chain-length hydrocarbon structures representing paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic constituents in base oil lubricants were modelled . Results showed typical log Kow values from 4.9 to 7.7, which were consistent with values of &gt;4 for lubricating oil basestocks\u00a0</p> <p><b>Water Solubility:</b>When released to water, base oils will float and spread at a rate that is viscosity dependent. While water solubility of base oils is typically very low, individual hydrocarbons exhibit a wide range of solubility depending on molecular weight and degree of unsaturation. Decreasing molecular weight (i.e., carbon number) and increasing levels of unsaturation increases the water solubility of these materials. As noted for partition coefficient, the water solubility of lubricating base oils cannot be determined due to their complex mixture characteristics. Therefore, the water solubility of individual C15 hydrocarbons representing the different groups making up base oils (i.e., linear and branched paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) was modelled. Based on water solubility modelling of those groups, aqueous solubilities are typically much less than 1 ppm. (0.003-0.63 mg/l)</p> <p><b>Environmental Fate:</b></p> <p><b>Photodegradation:\u00a0</b>Chemicals having potential to photolyse have UV/visible absorption maxima in the range of 290 to 800 nm. Some chemicals have absorption maxima significantly below 290 nm and consequently cannot undergo direct photolysis in sunlight (e.g. chemicals such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, saturated alcohols, and saturated acids). Most hydrocarbon constituents of the materials in this category are not expected to photolyse since they do not show absorbance within the 290-800 nm range. However, photodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can occur and may be a significant degradation pathway for these constituents of lubricating base oils. The degree and rate at which PAHs may photodegrade depend upon whether conditions allow penetration of light with sufficient energy to effect a change. For example,polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) compounds bound to sediments may persist due to a lack of sufficient light penetration\u00a0</p> <p>Atmospheric gas-phase reactions can occur between organic chemicals and reactive molecules such as photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen oxides. Atmospheric oxidation as a result of radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but indirect degradation. In general, lubricating base oils have low vapour pressures and volatilisation is not expected to be a significant removal mechanism for the majority of the hydrocarbon components. However, some components (e.g., C15 branched paraffins and naphthenes) appear to have the potential to volatilise Atmospheric half-lives of 0.10 to 0.66 days have been calculated for representative C15 hydrocarbon components of lubricating base oils\u00a0</p> <p><b>Stability in Water:\u00a0</b>Chemicals that have a potential to hydrolyze include alkyl halides, amides, carbamates, carboxylic acid esters and lactones, epoxides, phosphate esters, and sulfonic acid esters. Because lubricating base oils do not contain significant levels of these functional groups, materials in the lubricating base oils category are not subject to hydrolysis\u00a0</p> <p><b>Chemical Transport and Distribution in the Environment :\u00a0</b>Based on the physical-chemical characteristics of component hydrocarbons in lubricating base oils, the lower molecular weight components are expected to have the highest vapour pressures and water solubilities, and the lowest partition coefficients. These factors enhance the potential for widespread distribution in the environment. To gain an understanding of the potential transport and distribution of lubricating base oil components, the EQC (Equilibrium Criterion) model was used to characterize the environmental distribution of different C15 compounds representing different structures found in lube oils (e.g., paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics). The modelling found partitioning to soil or air is the ultimate fate of these C15 compounds. Aromatic compounds partition principally to soil. Linear paraffins partition mostly to soil, while branching appears to allow greater distribution to air. Naphthenes distribute to both soil and air, with increasing proportions in soil for components with the greater number of ring structures. Because the modelling does not take into account degradation factors, levels modelled in the atmosphere are likely overstated in light of the tendency for indirect photodegradation to occur.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Biodegradation: \u00a0T</b>he extent of biodegradation measured for a particular lubricating oil basestock is dependent not only on the procedure used but also on how the sample is presented in the biodegradation test. Lubricant base oils typically are not readily biodegradable in standard 28-day tests. However, since the oils consist primarily of hydrocarbons that are ultimately assimilated by microorganisms, and therefore inherently biodegradable. Twenty-eight biodegradability studies have been reported for a variety of lubricating base oils. Based on the results of ultimate biodegradability tests using modified Sturm and manometric respirometry testing the base oils are expected to be, for the most part, inherently biodegradable. Biodegradation rates found using the modified Sturm procedure ranged from 1.5 to 29%. Results from the manometric respirometry tests on similar materials showed biodegradation rates from 31 to 50%. Biodegradation rates measured in 21-day CEC tests for similar materials ranged from 13 to 79%.</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Numerous acute studies covering fish, invertebrates, and algae have been conducted to assess the ecotoxicity of various lubricating base oils. None of these studies have shown evidence of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. Eight, 7-day exposure studies using rainbow trout failed to demonstrate toxicity when tested up to the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Three, 96-hour tests with rainbow trout also failed to show any toxic effects when tested up to 1000 mg/L applied as dispersions. Similarly, three 96-hour tests with fathead minnows at a maximum test concentration of 100 mg/L water accommodated fractions (WAF) showed no adverse effects. Two species of aquatic invertebrates (Daphnia magna and Gammarus sp.) were exposed to WAF solutions up to 10,000 mg/L for 48 and 96-hours, respectively, with no adverse effects being observed. \u00a0Four-day exposures of the freshwater green alga (Scenedesmus subspicatus) to 500 mg/L WAF solutions failed to show adverse effects on growth rate and algal cell densities in four studies\u00a0</p> <p>Multiple chronic ecotoxicity studies have shown no adverse effects to daphnid survival or reproduction. In 10 of 11 chronic studies, daphnids were exposed for 21 days to WAF preparations of lubricating base oils with no ill effects on survival or reproduction at the maximum concentration of 1000 mg/L. One test detected a reduction in reproduction at 1000 mg/L. \u00a0Additional data support findings of no chronic toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fish. No observed effect levels ranged from 550 to 5,000 mg/L when tested as either dispersions or WAFs.\u00a0</p> <p>The data described above are supported by studies on a homologous series of alkanes. The author concluded that the water solubility of carbon chains .C10 is too limited to elicit acute toxicity. This also was shown for alkylbenzene compounds having carbon numbers .C15. Since base oils consist of carbon compounds of C15 to C50, component hydrocarbons that are of acute toxicological concern are, for the most part, absent in these materials. Similarly, due to their low solubility, the alkylated two to three ring polyaromatic components in base oils are not expected to cause acute or chronic toxicity. This lack of toxicity is borne out in the results of the reported studies.\u00a0</p> <p>The effects of crude and refined oils on organisms found in fresh and sea water ha been extensively reviewed.</p> <p>sea water. Where spillages occur the non-mobile species suffer the greatest mortality, whereas fish species can often escape from the affected region. The extent of the initial mortality depends on the chemical nature of the oil, the location, and the physical conditions, particularly the temperature and wind velocity. Most affected freshwater and marine communities recover from the effects of an oil spill within a year. The occurrence of biogenic hydrocarbons in the world's oceans is well recorded. They have the characteristic isoprenoid structure, and measurements made in water columns indicate a background concentration of 1.0 to 10 ul/l. The higher molecular weight materials are dispersed as particles, with the highest concentrations of about 20 ul/l occurring in the top 3 mm layer of water.</p> <p>A wide variation in the response of organisms to oil exposures has been noted. The larvae of fish and crustaceans appear to be most susceptible to the water-soluble fraction of crude oil. Exposures of plankton and algae have indicated that certain species of diatoms and green algae are inhibited, whereas microflagellates are not.</p> <p>For the most part, molluscs and most intertidal worm species appear to be tolerant of oil contamination.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

Contaminants in the form of additives and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs - as in the crude base stock) are probably responsible. PAH levels are higher in aromatic process oils/used/reclaimed motor oils. Subchronic 90-day feeding studies conducted on male and female rats on highly refined white mineral oils and waxes found that higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons (microcrystalline waxes and the higher viscosity oils) were without biological effects. Paraffin waxes and low- to mid viscosity oils produced biological effects that were inversely proportional to molecular weight, viscosity and melting point: oil-type and processing did not appear to be determinants. Biological effects were more pronounced in females than in males. Effects occurred mainly in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes and included increased organ weights, microscopic inflammatory changes, and evidence for the presence of saturated mineral hydrocarbons in affected tissues. Inflammation of the cardiac mitral valve was also observed at high doses in rats treated with paraffin waxes.</p> <p>Smith J.H., et al: Toxicologic Pathology: 24, 2, 214-230, 1996</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Mildly-treated solvent refined oils, both naphthenic and paraffinic, induce skin tumours after repeated skin applications in mice.

Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers\u2019 technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">\u00b7<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><span style=\"color:black\">Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Gloves must only be worn on clean hands.

                "Environment": "<p>for Petroleum Hydrocarbon Gases:</p> <p><b>Environmental fate:</b></p> <p>The environmental fate characteristics of petroleum hydrocarbon gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. All components of these gases will partition to the air where interaction with hydroxyl radicals is an important fate process. Hydrocarbons having molecular weights represented in these streams are inherently biodegradable, but their tendency to partition to the atmosphere would prevent their biotic degradation in water and soils. However, if higher molecular weight fractions of these streams enter the aquatic or terrestrial environment, biodegradation may be an important fate mechanism.</p> <p>The majority of components making up hydrocarbon gases typically have low melting and boiling points. They also have high vapor pressures and low octanol/water partition coefficients. The aqueous solubilities of these substances vary, and range from approximately 22 parts per million to several hundred parts per million. The environmental fate characteristics of refinery gases are governed by these physical-chemical attributes. Components of the hydrocarbon gas streams will partition to the air, and photodegradation reactions will be an important fate process for many of the hydrocarbon components. The hydrocarbons in these mixtures are inherently biodegradable, but due to their tendency to partition to the atmosphere, biodegradation is not anticipated to be an important fate mechanisms. However, if released to water or soil, some of the higher molecular weight fractions may become available for microbial attack. The inorganic gases are chemically stable and may be lost to the atmosphere or simply become involved in the environmental recycling of their atoms. Some show substantial water solubility, but their volatility eventually causes these gases to enter the atmosphere.</p> <p>Substances in Refinery Gases that volatilise to air may undergo a gas-phase oxidation reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (OH-). Atmospheric oxidation as a result of hydroxyl radical attack is not direct photochemical degradation, but rather indirect degradation Indirect photodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in Refinery Gases can be an important fate process for these constituents. In general, half lives decrease with increasing carbon chain length. Half lives for this fraction of Refinery Gases ranged from 960 days (methane) to 0.16 days (butadiene). The constituents of the C5- C6 hydrocarbon fraction have photodegradation half-lives of approximately two days.</p> <p>The hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon constituents in Refinery Gases do not contain the functional groups or chemical linkages known to undergo hydrolysis reactions. Therefore hydrolysis will not play an important role in the environmental fate for the components in Refinery Gas streams.\u00a0</p> <p>Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon components in refinery gases may occur in soil and water. Gaseous hydrocarbons are widespread in nature and numerous types of microbes have evolved which are capable of oxidizing these substances as their sole energy source . Although volatilization is the predominant behavior for these gases, sufficient aqueous solubility and bioavailability is exhibited by these compounds. The use of gaseous carbon sources for cell growth is common among autotrophic organisms . Higher chain length hydrocarbons typical of naphtha streams also are known to inherently biodegrade in the environment\u00a0</p> <p><b>Ecotoxicity:</b></p> <p>Acute LC/EC50 values for the hydrocarbon components of these gas streams ranged roughly from 1 to 100 mg/L.</p> <p>Although the LC/EC50 data for the individual gases illustrate the potential toxicity to aquatic organisms, aqueous concentrations from releases of these gases would likely not persist in the aquatic environment for a sufficient duration to elicit toxicity. Based on a simple conceptual exposure model analysis, emissions of petroleum hydrocarbon gases to the atmosphere would not likely result in acutely toxic concentrations in adjacent water bodies because such emissions will tend to remain in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Several of the constituents in refinery gases were shown to be highly hazardous to aquatic organisms in laboratory toxicity tests where exposure concentrations can be maintained over time. Hydrogen sulfide was shown to be the most toxic constituent to fish (LC50 ranged 0.007 to 0.2 mg/L) and invertebrates (EC50 ranged 0.022 to 1.07 mg/L), although several LC/EC50 values for ammonia also were below 1 mg/l for these organisms (0.083 to 4.6 mg/L and 0.53 to 22.8 mg/L, respectively).\u00a0</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>For isobutane:</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Refrigerant Gas: Saturated Hydrocarbons have zero ozone depletion\r\npotential (ODP) and will photodegrade under atmospheric conditions.\r\n&nbsp;[Calor Gas]</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Environmental Fate</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:\r\nnormal'><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\r\ncolor:black'>Terrestrial fate:&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>&nbsp;An\r\nestimated Koc value of 35 suggests that isobutane will have very high mobility\r\nin soil.

Volatilisation of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07x10-1 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg, and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L. Propane is expected to volatilise from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using cell suspensions of microorganisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidised to acetone within 24 hours, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Aquatic fate:\u00a0</b>The estimated Koc value indicates that propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Volatilisation from water surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant. Using this Henry's Law constant volatilisation half-lives for a model river and model lake are estimated to be 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively. \u00a0An estimated BCF of 13.1 using log Kow suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. After 192 hr, the trace concentration of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Atmospheric fate</b>:: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and vapour pressure, propane is expected to exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.15x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg C. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths &gt;290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.</p> <p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><b>DO NOT</b></font><font color=\"#ff0000\">\u00a0discharge into sewer or waterways.</font></p>",

The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of 1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.) for extraction of gases discharged 2 meters distant from the extraction point.

This may be accompanied by narcosis, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination and vertigo.</p> <p>Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual.</p> <p>Limited evidence or practical experience suggests that the material may produce irritation of the respiratory system, in a significant number of individuals, following inhalation. In contrast to most organs, the lung is able to respond to a chemical insult by first removing or neutralising the irritant and then repairing the damage. The repair process, which initially evolved to protect mammalian lungs from foreign matter and antigens, may however, produce further lung damage resulting in the impairment of gas exchange, the primary function of the lungs. Respiratory tract irritation often results in an inflammatory response involving the recruitment and activation of many cell types, mainly derived from the vascular system.</p> <p>No health effects were seen in humans exposed at 1,000 ppm isobutane for up to 8 hours or 500 ppm for 8 hours/day for 10 days. Isobutane can have anaesthetic and asphyxiant effects at high concentrations, well above the lower explosion limit of 1.8% (18,000 ppm).</p> <p>Butane is a simple asphyxiant and is mildly anaesthetic at high concentrations (20-25%). 10000 ppm for 10 minutes causes drowsiness.</p> <p>Narcotic effects may be accompanied by exhilaration, dizziness, headache, nausea, confusion, incoordination and unconsciousness in severe cases</p> <p>Some aliphatic hydrocarbons produce axonal neuropathies. Isoparaffinic hydrocarbons produce injury to the kidneys of male rats. When albino rats were exposed to isoparaffins at 21.4 mg/l for 4 hours, all animals experienced weakness, tremors, salivation, mild to moderate convulsions, chromodacryorrhoea and ataxia within the first 24 hours. Symptoms disappeared after 24 hours.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated sensory irritation in laboratory animals or odor or sensory response in humans. When evaluated by a standard procedure to assess upper airway irritation, isoparaffins did not produce sensory irritation in mice exposed to up to 400 ppm isoparaffin in air. Human volunteers were exposed for six hours to 100 ppm isoparaffin. The subjects were given a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, which included dryness of the mucous membranes, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling of inebriation, visual disturbances, tremor, muscular weakness, impairment of coordination or paresthesia. No symptoms associated with solvent exposure were observed. With a human expert panel, odour from liquid imaging copier emissions became weakly discernible at approximately 50 ppm.\u00a0</p> <p>Numerous long-term exposures have been conducted in animals with only one major finding observed. Renal tubular damage has been found in kidneys of male rats upon repeated exposures to isoparaffins. It does not occur in mice or in female rats. This male rat nephropathy has been observed with a number of hydrocarbons, including wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline. The phenomenon has been attributed to reversible binding of hydrocarbon to alpha2-globulin. Since humans do not synthesize alpha2-globulin or a similar protein, the finding is not considered to be of biological significance to man. No clinically significant renal abnormalities have been found in refinery workers exposed to hydrocarbons.</p> <p>When evaluated for developmental toxicity in rats, isoparaffins were neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic.

Abrupt collapse may produce traumatic injury. Central nervous system (CNS) depression may be evident early. Symptoms of moderate poisoning may include giddiness, headache, dizziness and nausea. Serious poisonings may result in respiratory depression and may be fatal.</p> <p>\u00a0The paraffin gases C1-4 are practically non-toxic below their lower flammability limits (18000-50000 ppm). Above this level, incidental effects include CNS depression and irritation but these are reversible upon cessation of the exposure. The C3 and iso-C5 hydrocarbons show increasing narcotic properties; branching of the chain also enhances the effect. The C4 hydrocarbons appear to be more highly neurotoxic than the C3 and C5 members. Several fatalities due to voluntary inhalation of butane have been reported, possibly due to central, respiratory and circulatory effects resulting from anaesthesia, laryngeal oedema, chemical pneumonia or the combined effects of cardiac toxicity and increased sympathomimetic effects.</p> <p>\u00a0Inhalation of petroleum gases may produce narcosis, due in part to olefinic impurities. Displacement of oxygen in the air may cyanosis. If present in sufficient quantity these gases may reduce the oxygen level to below 18% producing asphyxiation.

Chronic exposure by petroleum workers, to the lighter  hydrocarbons, has been associated with visual disturbances, damage to  the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies (including numbness  and paraesthesias), psychological and neurophysiological deficits, bone  marrow toxicities (including hypoplasia possibly due to benzene) and  hepatic and renal involvement. Chronic dermal exposure to petroleum  hydrocarbons may result in defatting which produces localised  dermatoses. Surface cracking and erosion may also increase  susceptibility to infection by microorganisms. One epidemiological study  of petroleum refinery workers has reported elevations in standard  mortality ratios for skin cancer along with a dose-response relationship  indicating an association between routine workplace exposure to  petroleum or one of its constituents and skin cancer, particularly  melanoma. Other studies have been unable to confirm this finding.<br />Hydrocarbon  solvents are liquid hydrocarbon fractions derived from petroleum  processing streams, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms, with  carbon numbers ranging from approximately C5-C20 and boiling between  approximately 35-370 deg C. Many of the hydrocarbon solvents have  complex and variable compositions with constituents of 4 types, alkanes  (normal paraffins, isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins) and aromatics  (primarily alkylated one- and two-ring species). Despite the  compositional complexity, most hydrocarbon solvent constituents have  similar toxicological properties, and the overall toxicological hazards  can be characterized in generic terms. Hydrocarbon solvents can cause  chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lung, and those that are  volatile can cause acute CNS effects and/or ocular and respiratory  irritation at exposure levels exceeding occupational recommendations.  Otherwise, there are few toxicologically important effects. The  exceptions, n-hexane and naphthalene, have unique toxicological  properties<br /><br />Animal studies:<br />No deaths or treatment related  signs of toxicity were observed in rats exposed to light alkylate  naphtha (paraffinic hydrocarbons) at concentrations of 668, 2220 and  6646 ppm for 6 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 13 weeks. Increased liver weights  and kidney toxicity (male rats) was observed in high dose animals.  Exposure to pregnant rats at concentrations of 137, 3425 and 6850 ppm  did not adversely affect reproduction or cause maternal or foetal  toxicity. Lifetime skin painting studies in mice with similar naphthas  have shown weak or no carcinogenic activity following prolonged and  repeated exposure.\u00a0 Similar<br />naphthas/distillates, when tested at  nonirritating dose levels, did not show any significant carcinogenic  activity indicating that this tumorigenic response is likely related to  chronic irritation and not to dose. The mutagenic potential of naphthas  has been reported to be largely negative in a variety of mutagenicity  tests.\u00a0 The exact relationship between these results and human health is  not known. Some components of this product have been shown to produce a  species specific, sex hormonal dependent kidney lesion in male rats  from repeated oral or inhalation exposure. Subsequent research has shown  that the kidney damage develops via the formation of a  alpha-2u-globulin, a mechanism unique to the male rat.\u00a0 Humans do not  form alpha-2u-globulin, therefore, the kidney effects resulting from  this mechanism are not relevant in human.</p>",
